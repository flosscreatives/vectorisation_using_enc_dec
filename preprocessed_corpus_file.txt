	so a reminder may be in order
	the book you hold in your hands is the fifth volume of a song of ice and fire
	the fourth volume was a feast for crows
	however, this volume does not follow that one in the traditional sense, so much as run in tandem with it
	both dance and feast take up the story immediately after the events of the third volume in the series, a storm of swords
	whereas feast focused on events in and around kings landing, on the iron islands, and down in dorne, dance takes us north to castle black and the wall and beyond, and across the narrow sea to pentos and slavers bay, to pick up the tales of tyrion lannister, jon snow, daenerys targaryen, and all the other characters you did not see in the preceding volume
	rather than being sequential, the two books are parallel  divided geographically, rather than chronologically
	but only up to a point
	a dance with dragons is a longer book than a feast for crows, and covers a longer time period
	in the latter half of this volume, you will notice certain of the viewpoint characters from a feast for crows popping up again
	and that means just what you think it means the narrative has moved past the time frame of feast, and the two streams have once again rejoined each other
	next up, the winds of winter
	wherein, i hope, everybody will be shivering together once again

	the warg stopped beneath a tree and sniffed, his greybrown fur dappled by shadow
	a sigh of piney wind brought the manscent to him, over fainter smells that spoke of fox and hare, seal and stag, even wolf
	those were mansmells too, the warg knew the stink of old skins, dead and sour, near drowned beneath the stronger scents of smoke and blood and rot
	only man stripped the skins from other beasts and wore their hides and hair
	wargs have no fear of man, as wolves do
	hate and hunger coiled in his belly, and he gave a low growl, calling to his oneeyed brother, to his small sly sister
	as he raced through the trees, his packmates followed hard on his heels
	they had caught the scent as well
	as he ran, he saw through their eyes too and glimpsed himself ahead
	the breath of the pack puffed warm and white from long grey jaws
	ice had frozen between their paws, hard as stone, but the hunt was on now, the prey ahead
	flesh, the warg thought, meat
	a man alone was a feeble thing
	big and strong, with good sharp eyes, but dull of ear and deaf to smells
	deer and elk and even hares were faster, bears and boars fiercer in a fight
	but men in packs were dangerous
	as the wolves closed on the prey, the warg heard the wailing of a pup, the crust of last nights snow breaking under clumsy manpaws, the rattle of hardskins and the long grey claws men carried
	swords, a voice inside him whispered, spears
	the trees had grown icy teeth, snarling down from the bare brown branches
	one eye ripped through the undergrowth, spraying snow
	his packmates followed
	up a hill and down the slope beyond, until the wood opened before them and the men were there
	the furwrapped bundle she clutched was her pup
	leave her for last, the voice whispered, the males are the danger
	they were roaring at each other as men did, but the warg could smell their terror
	one had a wooden tooth as tall as he was
	he flung it, but his hand was shaking and the tooth sailed high
	then the pack was on them
	his oneeyed brother knocked the tooththrower back into a snowdrift and tore his throat out as he struggled
	his sister slipped behind the other male and took him from the rear
	that left the female and her pup for him
	she had a tooth too, a little one made of bone, but she dropped it when the wargs jaws closed around her leg
	as she fell, she wrapped both arms around her noisy pup
	underneath her furs the female was just skin and bones, but her dugs were full of milk
	the sweetest meat was on the pup
	the wolf saved the choicest parts for his brother
	all around the carcasses, the frozen snow turned pink and red as the pack filled its bellies
	harry potter and the sorcerer's stone chapter one the boy who lived mr
	dursley, of number four, privet drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much
	they were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense
	dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings, which made drills
	he was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache
	dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors
	the dursleys had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere
	the dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it
	they didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters
	dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years in fact, mrs
	dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her goodfornothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be
	the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street
	the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him
	this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away they didn't want dudley mixing with a child like that
	dursley woke up on the dull, gray tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country
	dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and mrs
	dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chair
	none of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window
	at half past eight, mr
	dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked mrs
	dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss dudley goodbye but missed, because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls
	little tyke, chortled mr
	dursley as he left the house
	he got into his car and backed out of number four's drive
	it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar  a cat reading a map
	dursley didn't realize what he had seen  then he jerked his head around to look again
	there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive, but there wasn't a map in sight
	what could he have been thinking of it must have been a trick of the light
	dursley blinked and stared at the cat
	dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror
	it was now reading the sign that said privet drive  no, looking at the sign cats couldn't read maps or signs
	dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind
	as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day
	but on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else
	as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about
	dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes  the getups you saw on young people he supposed this was some stupid new fashion
	he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by
	they were whispering excitedly together
	dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak the nerve of him but then it struck mr
	dursley that this was probably some silly stunt  these people were obviously collecting for something
	yes, that would be it
	the traffic moved on and a few minutes later, mr
	dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills
	dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor
	if he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning
	he didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead
	most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime
	dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owlfree morning
	he yelled at five different people
	he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more
	he was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery
	he'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's
	he eyed them angrily as he passed
	he didn't know why, but they made him uneasy
	this bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin
	it was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying
	the potters, that's right, that's what i heard yes, their son, harry mr
	dursley stopped dead
	he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it
	he dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind
	he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking
	no, he was being stupid
	potter wasn't such an unusual name
	he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry
	come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called harry
	he'd never even seen the boy
	it might have been harvey
	there was no point in worrying mrs
	dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister
	he didn't blame her  if he'd had a sister like that
	but all the same, those people in cloaks
	he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door
	sorry, he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell
	it was a few seconds before mr
	dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak
	he didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground
	on the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today rejoice, for youknowwho has gone at last even muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day and the old man hugged mr
	dursley around the middle and walked off
	dursley stood rooted to the spot
	he had been hugged by a complete stranger
	he also thought he had been called a muggle, whatever that was
	he hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination
	as he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw  and it didn't improve his mood  was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning
	it was now sitting on his garden wall
	he was sure it was the same one it had the same markings around its eyes
	it just gave him a stern look
	was this normal cat behavior mr
	trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house
	he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife
	dursley had had a nice, normal day
	she told him over dinner all about mrs
	next door's problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word won't
	dursley tried to act normally
	when dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news and finally, birdwatchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today
	although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise
	experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern
	the newscaster allowed himself a grin
	and now, over to jim mcguffin with the weather
	going to be any more showers of owls tonight, jim well, ted, said the weatherman, i don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today
	viewers as far apart as kent, yorkshire, and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early  it's not until next week, folks but i can promise a wet night tonight
	dursley sat frozen in his armchair
	shooting stars all over britain owls flying by daylight mysterious people in cloaks all over the place and a whisper, a whisper about the potters
	dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea
	he'd have to say something to her
	he cleared his throat nervously
	er  petunia, dear  you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you as he had expected, mrs
	dursley looked shocked and angry
	after all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister
	no, she said sharply
	why funny stuff on the news, mr
	and there were a lot of funnylooking people in town today
	well, i just thought
	it was something to do with
	dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips
	dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name potter
	he decided he didn't dare
	instead he said, as casually as he could, their son  he'd be about dudley's age now, wouldn't he i suppose so, said mrs
	what's his name again howard, isn't it harry
	nasty, common name, if you ask me
	dursley, his heart sinking horribly
	he didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed
	dursley was in the bathroom, mr
	dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden
	the cat was still there
	it was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for something
	was he imagining things could all this have anything to do with the potters if it did
	if it got out that they were related to a pair of  well, he didn't think he could bear it
	the dursleys got into bed
	dursley fell asleep quickly but mr
	dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind
	his last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs
	the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind
	he couldn't see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on  he yawned and turned over  it couldn't affect them
	how very wrong he was
	dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness
	it was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive
	it didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead
	in fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all
	a man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground
	the cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed
	nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive
	he was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt
	he was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and highheeled, buckled boots
	his blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind halfmoon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice
	this man's name was albus dumbledore
	albus dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome
	he was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something
	but he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street
	for some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him
	he chuckled and muttered, i should have known
	he found what he was looking for in his inside pocket
	it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter
	he flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it
	the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop
	he clicked it again  the next lamp flickered into darkness
	twelve times he clicked the putouter, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him
	if anyone looked out of their window now, even beadyeyed mrs
	dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement
	dumbledore slipped the putouter back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat
	he didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it
	fancy seeing you here, professor mcgonagall
	he turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone
	instead he was smiling at a rather severelooking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes
	she, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one
	her black hair was drawn into a tight bun
	she looked distinctly ruffled
	how did you know it was me she asked
	my dear professor, i 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly
	you'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day, said professor mcgonagall
	all day when you could have been celebrating i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here
	professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily
	oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right, she said impatiently
	you'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no  even the muggles have noticed something's going on
	it was on their news
	she jerked her head back at the dursleys' dark livingroom window
	well, they're not completely stupid
	they were bound to notice something
	shooting stars down in kent  i'll bet that was dedalus diggle
	he never had much sense
	you can't blame them, said dumbledore gently
	we've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years
	i know that, said professor mcgonagall irritably
	but that's no reason to lose our heads
	people are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in muggle clothes, swapping rumors
	she threw a sharp, sideways glance at dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on
	a fine thing it would be if, on the very day youknowwho seems to have disappeared at last, the muggles found out about us all
	i suppose he really has gone, dumbledore it certainly seems so, said dumbledore
	we have much to be thankful for
	would you care for a lemon drop a what a lemon drop
	they're a kind of muggle sweet i'm rather fond of no, thank you, said professor mcgonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops
	as i say, even if youknowwho has gone  my dear professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name all this 'you knowwho' nonsense  for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort
	professor mcgonagall flinched, but dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice
	it all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'youknowwho
	' i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemort's name
	i know you haven 't, said professor mcgonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring
	but you're different
	everyone knows you're the only one youknow oh, all right, voldemort, was frightened of
	you flatter me, said dumbledore calmly
	voldemort had powers i will never have
	only because you're too  well  noble to use them
	it's lucky it's dark
	i haven't blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs
	professor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said, the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around
	you know what everyone's saying about why he's disappeared about what finally stopped him it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now
	it was plain that whatever everyone was saying, she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true
	dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer
	what they're saying, she pressed on, is that last night voldemort turned up in godric's hollow
	he went to find the potters
	the rumor is that lily and james potter are  are  that they're  dead
	dumbledore bowed his head
	professor mcgonagall gasped
	i didn't want to believe it
	dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder
	professor mcgonagall's voice trembled as she went on
	they're saying he tried to kill the potter's son, harry
	he couldn't kill that little boy
	no one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill harry potter, voldemort's power somehow broke  and that's why he's gone
	dumbledore nodded glumly
	it's  it's true faltered professor mcgonagall
	all the people he's killed
	he couldn't kill a little boy it's just astounding
	of all the things to stop him
	but how in the name of heaven did harry survive we can only guess, said dumbledore
	professor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles
	dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it
	it was a very odd watch
	it had twelve hands but no numbers instead, little planets were moving around the edge
	it must have made sense to dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, hagrid's late
	i suppose it was he who told you i'd be here, by the way yes, said professor mcgonagall
	and i don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places i've come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle
	they're the only family he has left now
	you don't mean  you can't mean the people who live here cried professor mcgonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four
	dumbledore  you can't
	i've been watching them all day
	you couldn't find two people who are less like us
	and they've got this son  i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets
	harry potter come and live here it's the best place for him, said dumbledore firmly
	his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older
	i've written them a letter
	a letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall
	really, dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter these people will never understand him he'll be famous  a legend  i wouldn't be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future  there will be books written about harry  every child in our world will know his name exactly, said dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his halfmoon glasses
	it would be enough to turn any boy's head
	famous before he can walk and talk famous for something he won't even remember cara you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it professor mcgonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, yes  yes, you're right, of course
	but how is the boy getting here, dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it
	hagrid's bringing him
	you think it  wise  to trust hagrid with something as important as this i would trust hagrid with my life, said dumbledore
	i'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place, said professor mcgonagall grudgingly, but you can't pretend he's not careless
	he does tend to  what was that a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them
	it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky  and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them
	if the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it
	he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide
	he looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild  long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins
	in his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets
	hagrid, said dumbledore, sounding relieved
	and where did you get that motorcycle borrowed it, professor dumbledore, sit, said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke
	young sirius black lent it to me
	no problems, were there no, sir  house was almost destroyed, but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin' around
	he fell asleep as we was flyin' over bristol
	dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets
	inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep
	under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning
	is that where  whispered professor mcgonagall
	yes, said dumbledore
	he'll have that scar forever
	couldn't you do something about it, dumbledore even if i could, i wouldn't
	scars can come in handy
	i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground
	well  give him here, hagrid  we'd better get this over with
	dumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys' house
	could i  could i say goodbye to him, sir asked hagrid
	he bent his great, shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss
	then, suddenly, hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog
	shhh hissed professor mcgonagall, you'll wake the muggles sssorry, sobbed hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it
	but i cccan't stand it  lily an' james dead  an' poor little harry off ter live with muggles  yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, hagrid, or we'll be found, professor mcgonagall whispered, patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door
	he laid harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two
	for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrid's shoulders shook, professor mcgonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out
	well, said dumbledore finally, that's that
	we've no business staying here
	we may as well go and join the celebrations
	yeah, said hagrid in a very muffled voice, i'll be takin' sirius his bike back
	g'night, professor mcgonagall  professor dumbledore, sir
	wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night
	i shall see you soon, i expect, professor mcgonagall, said dumbledore, nodding to her
	professor mcgonagall blew her nose in reply
	dumbledore turned and walked back down the street
	on the corner he stopped and took out the silver putouter
	he clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street
	he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four
	good luck, harry, he murmured
	he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone
	a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen
	harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up
	one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by mrs
	dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin dudley
	he couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices to harry potter  the boy who lived chapter two the vanishing glass nearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but privet drive had hardly changed at all
	the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys' front door it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr
	dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls
	only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed
	ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing differentcolored bonnets  but dudley dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother
	the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too
	yet harry potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long
	his aunt petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day
	up get up now harry woke with a start
	his aunt rapped on the door again
	harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove
	he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having
	it had been a good one
	there had been a flying motorcycle in it
	he had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before
	his aunt was back outside the door
	are you up yet she demanded
	well, get a move on, i want you to look after the bacon
	and don't you dare let it burn, i want everything perfect on duddy's birthday
	what did you say his aunt snapped through the door
	dudley's birthday  how could he have forgotten harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks
	he found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on
	harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept
	when he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen
	the table was almost hidden beneath all dudley's birthday presents
	it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike
	exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry, as dudley was very fat and hated exercise  unless of course it involved punching somebody
	dudley's favorite punching bag was harry, but he couldn't often catch him
	harry didn't look it, but he was very fast
	perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but harry had always been small and skinny for his age
	he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudley's, and dudley was about four times bigger than he was
	harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes
	he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose
	the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning
	he had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten it
	in the car crash when your parents died, she had said
	and don't ask questions
	don't ask questions  that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleys
	uncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the bacon
	comb your hair he barked, by way of a morning greeting
	about once a week, uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut
	harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way  all over the place
	harry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother
	dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon
	he had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head
	aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel  harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wig
	harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room
	dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents
	thirtysix, he said, looking up at his mother and father
	that's two less than last year
	darling, you haven't counted auntie marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from mommy and daddy
	all right, thirtyseven then, said dudley, going red in the face
	harry, who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table over
	aunt petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, and we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today
	how's that, popkin two more presents
	is that all right'' dudley thought for a moment
	it looked like hard work
	finally he said slowly, so i'll have thirty
	thirtynine, sweetums, said aunt petunia
	dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel
	uncle vernon chuckled
	little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father
	'atta boy, dudley he ruffled dudley's hair
	at that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a vcr
	he was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried
	bad news, vernon, she said
	figg's broken her leg
	she jerked her head in harry's direction
	dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but harry's heart gave a leap
	every year on dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies
	every year, harry was left behind with mrs
	figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away
	harry hated it there
	the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs
	figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned
	now what said aunt petunia, looking furiously at harry as though he'd planned this
	harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs
	figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbles, snowy, mr
	paws, and tufty again
	we could phone marge, uncle vernon suggested
	don't be silly, vernon, she hates the boy
	the dursleys often spoke about harry like this, as though he wasn't there  or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug
	what about what'shername, your friend  yvonne on vacation in majorca, snapped aunt petunia
	you could just leave me here, harry put in hopefully he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudley's computer
	aunt petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon
	and come back and find the house in ruins she snarled
	i won't blow up the house, said harry, but they weren't listening
	i suppose we could take him to the zoo, said aunt petunia slowly,
	and leave him in the car
	that car's new, he's not sitting in it alone
	dudley began to cry loudly
	in fact, he wasn't really crying  it had been years since he'd really cried  but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted
	dinky duddydums, don't cry, mummy won't let him spoil your special day she cried, flinging her arms around him
	ttto come dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs
	he always sp spoils everything he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms
	just then, the doorbell rang  oh, good lord, they're here said aunt petunia frantically  and a moment later, dudley's best friend, piers polkiss, walked in with his mother
	piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat
	he was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while dudley hit them
	dudley stopped pretending to cry at once
	half an hour later, harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the dursleys' car with piers and dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life
	his aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, uncle vernon had taken harry aside
	i'm warning you, he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to harry's, i'm warning you now, boy  any funny business, anything at all  and you'll be in that cupboard from now until christmas
	i'm not going to do anything, said harry, honestly
	but uncle vernon didn't believe him
	the problem was, strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didn't make them happen
	once, aunt petunia, tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left to hide that horrible scar
	dudley had laughed himself silly at harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses
	next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off he had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly
	another time, aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudley's brown with orange puff balls  the harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit harry
	aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, harry wasn't punished
	on the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens
	dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney
	the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harry's headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings
	but all he'd tried to do as he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his cupboard was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors
	harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid jump
	but today, nothing was going to go wrong
	it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or mrs
	figg's cabbagesmelling living room
	while he drove, uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia
	he liked to complain about things people at work, harry, the council, harry, the bank, and harry were just a few of his favorite subjects
	this morning, it was motorcycles
	roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums, he said, as a motorcycle overtook them
	i had a dream about a motorcycle, said harry, remembering suddenly
	uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front
	he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycles don't fly dudley and piers sniggered
	i know they don't, said harry
	but he wished he hadn't said anything
	if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon  they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas
	it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families
	the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop
	it wasn't bad, either, harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley, except that it wasn't blond
	harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time
	he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him
	they ate in the zoo restaurant, and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the first
	harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last
	after lunch they went to the reptile house
	it was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls
	behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone
	dudley and piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, mancrushing pythons
	dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place
	it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can  but at the moment it didn't look in the mood
	in fact, it was fast asleep
	dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils
	make it move, he whined at his father
	uncle vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge
	do it again, dudley ordered
	uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on
	this is boring, dudley moaned
	harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake
	he wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself  no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long
	it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house
	the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes
	slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harry's
	then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching
	he looked back at the snake and winked, too
	the snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling
	it gave harry a look that said quite plainly i get that all the time
	i know, harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him
	it must be really annoying
	the snake nodded vigorously
	where do you come from, anyway harry asked
	the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass
	boa constrictor, brazil
	was it nice there the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen was bred in the zoo
	oh, i see  so you've never been to brazil as the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jump
	dursley come and look at this snake you won't believe what it's doing dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could
	out of the way, you, he said, punching harry in the ribs
	caught by surprise, harry fell hard on the concrete floor
	what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened  one second, piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror
	harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished
	the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor
	people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits
	as the snake slid swiftly past him, harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, brazil, here i come
	the keeper of the reptile house was in shock
	but the glass, he kept saying, where did the glass go the zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again
	piers and dudley could only gibber
	as far as harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in uncle vernon's car, dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death
	but worst of all, for harry at least, was piers calming down enough to say, harry was talking to it, weren't you, harry uncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on harry
	he was so angry he could hardly speak
	he managed to say, go  cupboard  stay  no meals, before he collapsed into a chair, and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandy
	harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch
	he didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the dursleys were asleep yet
	until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food
	he'd lived with the dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash
	he couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died
	sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burn ing pain on his forehead
	this, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from
	he couldn't remember his parents at all
	his aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions
	there were no photographs of them in the house
	when he had been younger, harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family
	yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to know him
	very strange strangers they were, too
	a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley
	after asking harry furiously if he knew the man, aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything
	a wildlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus
	a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word
	the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer look
	at school, harry had no one
	everybody knew that dudley's gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with dudley's gang
	chapter three the letters from no one the escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longestever punishment
	by the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old mrs
	figg as she crossed privet drive on her crutches
	harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day
	piers, dennis, malcolm, and gordon were all big and stupid, but as dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader
	the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudley's favorite sport harry hunting
	this was why harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope
	when september came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be with dudley
	dudley had been accepted at uncle vernon's old private school, smeltings
	piers polkiss was going there too
	harry, on the other hand, was going to stonewall high, the local public school
	dudley thought this was very funny
	they stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at stonewall, he told harry
	want to come upstairs and practice no, thanks, said harry
	the poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it  it might be sick
	then he ran, before dudley could work out what he'd said
	one day in july, aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform, leaving harry at mrs
	figg wasn 't as bad as usual
	it turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before
	she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years
	that evening, dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brandnew uniform
	smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters
	they also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking
	this was supposed to be good training for later life
	as he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers, uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life
	aunt petunia burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her ickle dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grownup
	harry didn't trust himself to speak
	he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh
	there was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast
	it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink
	he went to have a look
	the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water
	what's this he asked aunt petunia
	her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question
	your new school uniform, she said
	harry looked in the bowl again
	oh, he said, i didn't realize it had to be so wet
	dota be stupid, snapped aunt petunia
	i'm dyeing some of dudley's old things gray for you
	it'll look just like everyone else's when i've finished
	harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue
	he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high  like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably
	dudley and uncle vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harry's new uniform
	uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual and dudley banged his smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table
	they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat
	get the mail, dudley, said uncle vernon from behind his paper
	poke him with your smelting stick, dudley
	harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail
	three things lay on the doormat a postcard from uncle vernon's sister marge, who was vacationing on the isle of wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and  a letter for harry
	harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band
	no one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him
	who would he had no friends, no other relatives  he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back
	yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake mr
	potter the cupboard under the stairs 4 privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emeraldgreen ink
	turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter h
	hurry up, boy shouted uncle vernon from the kitchen
	what are you doing, checking for letter bombs he chuckled at his own joke
	harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter
	he handed uncle vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope
	uncle vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard
	marge's ill, he informed aunt petunia
	dad said dudley suddenly
	dad, harry's got something harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle vernon
	that's mine said harry, trying to snatch it back
	who'd be writing to you sneered uncle vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it
	his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights
	and it didn't stop there
	within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge
	dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but uncle vernon held it high out of his reach
	aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first line
	for a moment it looked as though she might faint
	she clutched her throat and made a choking noise
	vernon oh my goodness  vernon they stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the room
	dudley wasn't used to being ignored
	he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting stick
	i want to read that letter, he said loudly
	want to read it, said harry furiously, as it's mine
	get out, both of you, croaked uncle vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope
	i want my letter he shouted
	let me see it demanded dudley
	out roared uncle vernon, and he took both harry and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them
	harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole dudley won, so harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor
	vernon, aunt petunia was saying in a quivering voice, look at the address  how could they possibly know where he sleeps you don't think they're watching the house watching  spying  might be following us, muttered uncle vernon wildly
	but what should we do, vernon should we write back tell them we don't want  harry could see uncle vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen
	if they don't get an answer
	we won't do anything
	but  i'm not having one in the house, petunia didn't we swear when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense that evening when he got back from work, uncle vernon did something he'd never done before he visited harry in his cupboard
	where's my letter said harry, the moment uncle vernon had squeezed through the door
	who's writing to me no one
	it was addressed to you by mistake, said uncle vernon shortly
	it was not a mistake, said harry angrily, it had my cupboard on it
	silence yelled uncle vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling
	he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful
	er  yes, harry  about this cupboard
	your aunt and i have been thinking
	you're really getting a bit big for it
	we think it might be nice if you moved into dudley's second bedroom
	don't ask questions snapped his uncle
	take this stuff upstairs, now
	the dursleys' house had four bedrooms one for uncle vernon and aunt petunia, one for visitors usually uncle vernon's sister, marge, one where dudley slept, and one where dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom
	it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room
	he sat down on the bed and stared around him
	nearly everything in here was broken
	the monthold video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog in the corner was dudley's firstever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley had sat on it
	other shelves were full of books
	they were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched
	from downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling at his mother, i don't want him in there
	harry sighed and stretched out on the bed
	yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here
	today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it
	next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet
	he'd screamed, whacked his father with his smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back
	harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall
	uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each other darkly
	when the mail arrived, uncle vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry, made dudley go and get it
	they heard him banging things with his smelting stick all the way down the hall
	then he shouted, there's another one 'mr
	potter, the smallest bedroom, 4 privet drive ' with a strangled cry, uncle vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, harry right behind him
	uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around the neck from behind
	after a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick, uncle vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with harry's letter clutched in his hand
	go to your cupboard  i mean, your bedroom, he wheezed at harry
	harry walked round and round his new room
	someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first letter
	surely that meant they'd try again and this time he'd make sure they didn't fail
	the repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning
	harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently
	he mustn't wake the dursleys
	he stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights
	he was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four first
	his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door  harry leapt into the air he'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat  something alive lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle's face
	uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do
	he shouted at harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea
	harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into uncle vernon's lap
	harry could see three letters addressed in green ink
	i want  he began, but uncle vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes
	uncle vernon didnt go to work that day
	he stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot
	see, he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of nails, if they can't deliver them they'll just give up
	i'm not sure that'll work, vernon
	oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, petunia, they're not like you and me, said uncle vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought him
	on friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for harry
	as they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom
	uncle vernon stayed at home again
	after burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out
	he hummed tiptoe through the tulips as he worked, and jumped at small noises
	on saturday, things began to get out of hand
	twentyfour letters to harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through the living room window
	while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, aunt petunia shredded the letters in her food processor
	who on earth wants to talk to you this badly dudley asked harry in amazement
	on sunday morning, uncle vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy
	no post on sundays, he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, no damn letters today  something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head
	next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets
	the dursleys ducked, but harry leapt into the air trying to catch one
	out out uncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hall
	when aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, uncle vernon slammed the door shut
	they could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor
	that does it, said uncle vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time
	i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave
	just pack some clothes
	no arguments he looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue
	ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boardedup doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway
	dudley was sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, vcr, and computer in his sports bag
	even aunt petunia didn't dare ask where they were going
	every now and then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while
	shake 'em off, he would mutter whenever he did this
	they didn't stop to eat or drink all day
	by nightfall dudley was howling
	he'd never had such a bad day in his life
	he was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer
	uncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomylooking hotel on the outskirts of a big city
	dudley and harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets
	dudley snored but harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering
	they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day
	they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table
	'scuse me, but is one of you mr
	potter only i got about an 'undred of these at the front desk
	she held up a letter so they could read the green ink address mr
	potter room 17 railview hotel cokeworth harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of the way
	i'll take them, said uncle vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room
	wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear aunt petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but uncle vernon didn't seem to hear her
	exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew
	he drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again
	the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage
	daddy's gone mad, hasn't he dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that afternoon
	uncle vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared
	great drops beat on the roof of the car
	it's monday, he told his mother
	the great humberto's on tonight
	i want to stay somewhere with a television
	this reminded harry of something
	if it was monday  and you could usually count on dudley to know the days the week, because of television  then tomorrow, tuesday, was harry's eleventh birthday
	of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun  last year, the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle vernon's old socks
	still, you weren't eleven every day
	uncle vernon was back and he was smiling
	he was also carrying a long, thin package and didn't answer aunt petunia when she asked what he'd bought
	found the perfect place he said
	come on everyone out it was very cold outside the car
	uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea
	perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine
	one thing was certain, there was no television in there
	storm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together
	and this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat a toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the irongray water below them
	i've already got us some rations, said uncle vernon, so all aboard it was freezing in the boat
	icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces
	after what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where uncle vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the brokendown house
	the inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty
	there were only two rooms
	uncle vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas
	he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up
	could do with some of those letters now, eh he said cheerfully
	he was in a very good mood
	obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail
	harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all
	as night fell, the promised storm blew up around them
	spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows
	aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the motheaten sofa
	she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket
	the storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on
	harry couldn't sleep
	he shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger
	dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight
	the lighted dial of dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time
	he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now
	harry heard something creak outside
	he hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did
	maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow
	was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that and two minutes to go what was that funny crunching noise was the rock crumbling into the sea one minute to go and he'd be eleven
	nine  maybe he'd wake dudley up, just to annoy him  three
	the whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door
	someone was outside, knocking to come in
	chapter four the keeper of the keys boom
	where's the cannon he said stupidly
	there was a crash behind them and uncle vernon came skidding into the room
	he was holding a rifle in his hands  now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them
	who's there he shouted
	i warn you  i'm armed there was a pause
	then  smash the door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor
	a giant of a man was standing in the doorway
	his face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair
	the giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling
	he bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame
	the noise of the storm outside dropped a little
	he turned to look at them all
	couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could yeh it's not been an easy journey
	he strode over to the sofa where dudley sat frozen with fear
	budge up, yeh great lump, said the stranger
	dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind uncle vernon
	an' here's harry said the giant
	harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile
	las' time i saw you, you was only a baby, said the giant
	yeh look a lot like yet dad, but yeh've got yet mom's eyes
	uncle vernon made a funny rasping noise
	i demand that you leave at once, sit he said
	you are breaking and entering ah, shut up, dursley, yeh great prune, said the giant he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of uncle vernon's hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room
	uncle vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on
	anyway  harry, said the giant, turning his back on the dursleys, a very happy birthday to yeh
	got summat fer yeh here  i mighta sat on it at some point, but it'll taste all right
	from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box
	harry opened it with trembling fingers
	inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icing
	harry looked up at the giant
	he meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, who are you the giant chuckled
	true, i haven't introduced meself
	rubeus hagrid, keeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts
	he held out an enormous hand and shook harry's whole arm
	what about that tea then, eh he said, rubbing his hands together
	i'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind
	his eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted
	he bent down over the fireplace they couldn't see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there
	it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath
	the giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea
	soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage
	nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, dudley fidgeted a little
	uncle vernon said sharply, don't touch anything he gives you, dudley
	the giant chuckled darkly
	yet great puddin' of a son don' need fattenin' anymore, dursley, don' worry
	he passed the sausages to harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his eyes off the giant
	finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, i'm sorry, but i still don't really know who you are
	the giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand
	call me hagrid, he said, everyone does
	an' like i told yeh, i'm keeper of keys at hogwarts  yeh'll know all about hogwarts, o' course
	hagrid looked shocked
	sorry, harry said quickly
	sony barked hagrid, turning to stare at the dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows
	it' s them as should be sorry i knew yeh weren't gettin' yer letters but i never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou' hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it all all what asked harry
	all what hagrid thundered
	now wait jus' one second he had leapt to his feet
	in his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut
	the dursleys were cowering against the wall
	do you mean ter tell me, he growled at the dursleys, that this boy  this boy  knows nothin' abou'  about anything harry thought this was going a bit far
	he had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad
	i know some things, he said
	i can, you know, do math and stuff
	but hagrid simply waved his hand and said, about our world, i mean
	what world hagrid looked as if he was about to explode
	uncle vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like mimblewimble
	hagrid stared wildly at harry
	but yeh must know about yet mom and dad, he said
	i mean, they're famous
	what my  my mom and dad weren't famous, were they yeh don' know
	hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing harry with a bewildered stare
	yeh don' know what yeh are he said finally
	uncle vernon suddenly found his voice
	stop right there, sit i forbid you to tell the boy anything a braver man than vernon dursley would have quailed under the furious look hagrid now gave him when hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage
	you never told him never told him what was in the letter dumbledore left fer him i was there i saw dumbledore leave it, dursley an' you've kept it from him all these years kept what from me said harry eagerly
	stop i forbid you yelled uncle vernon in panic
	aunt petunia gave a gasp of horror
	ah, go boil yet heads, both of yeh, said hagrid
	there was silence inside the hut
	only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard
	a what gasped harry
	a wizard, o' course, said hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, an' a thumpin' good'un, i'd say, once yeh've been trained up a bit
	with a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be an' i reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter
	harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to mr
	potter, the floor, hutontherock, the sea
	he pulled out the letter and read hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry headmaster albus dumbledore order of merlin, first class, grand sorc
	warlock, supreme mugwump, international confed
	potter, we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry
	please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment
	term begins on september 1
	we await your owl by no later than july 31
	yours sincerely, minerva mcgonagall, deputy headmistress questions exploded inside harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't decide which to ask first
	after a few minutes he stammered, what does it mean, they await my owl gallopin' gorgons, that reminds me, said hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl  a real, live, rather ruffledlooking owl  a long quill, and a roll of parchment
	with his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that harry could read upside down dear professor dumbledore, given harry his letter
	taking him to buy his things tomorrow
	hagrid hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm
	then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone
	harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly
	where was i said hagrid, but at that moment, uncle vernon, still ashenfaced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight
	he's not going, he said
	i'd like ter see a great muggle like you stop him, he said
	a what said harry, interested
	a muggle, said hagrid, it's what we call nonmagic folk like thern
	an' it's your bad luck you grew up in a family o' the biggest muggles i ever laid eyes on
	we swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish, said uncle vernon, swore we'd stamp it out of him wizard indeed you knew said harry
	you knew i'm a  a wizard knew shrieked aunt petunia suddenly
	knew of course we knew how could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to thatthat schooland came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats
	i was the only one who saw her for what she was  a freak but for my mother and father, oh no, it was lily this and lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family she stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on
	it seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years
	then she met that potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course i knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as  as  abnormal  and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you harry had gone very white
	as soon as he found his voice he said, blown up you told me they died in a car crash car crash roared hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the dursleys scuttled back to their corner
	how could a car crash kill lily an' james potter it's an outrage a scandal harry potter not knowin' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name but why what happened harry asked urgently
	the anger faded from hagrid's face
	he looked suddenly anxious
	i never expected this, he said, in a low, worried voice
	i had no idea, when dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin' hold of yeh, how much yeh didn't know
	ah, harry, i don' know if i'm the right person ter tell yeh  but someone 3 s gotta  yeh can't go off ter hogwarts not knowin'
	he threw a dirty look at the dursleys
	well, it's best yeh know as much as i can tell yeh  mind, i can't tell yeh everythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it
	he sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, it begins, i suppose, with  with a person called  but it's incredible yeh don't know his name, everyone in our world knows  who  well  i don' like sayin' the name if i can help it
	why not gulpin' gargoyles, harry, people are still scared
	blimey, this is difficult
	see, there was this wizard who went
	as bad as you could go
	hagrid gulped, but no words came out
	could you write it down harry suggested
	all right  voldemort
	don' make me say it again
	anyway, this  this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin' fer followers
	got 'em, too  some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o' his power, 'cause he was gettin' himself power, all right
	didn't know who ter trust, didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches
	terrible things happened
	'course, some stood up to him  an' he killed 'em
	one o' the only safe places left was hogwarts
	reckon dumbledore's the only one youknowwho was afraid of
	didn't dare try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway
	now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as i ever knew
	head boy an' girl at hogwarts in their day suppose the myst'ry is why youknowwho never tried to get 'em on his side before
	probably knew they were too close ter dumbledore ter want anythin' ter do with the dark side
	maybe he thought he could persuade 'em
	maybe he just wanted 'em outta the way
	all anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on halloween ten years ago
	you was just a year old
	he came ter yer house an'  an'  hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn
	but it's that sad  knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer people yeh couldn't find  anyway
	youknowwho killed 'em
	an' then  an' this is the real myst'ry of the thing  he tried to kill you, too
	wanted ter make a clean job of it, i suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then
	but he couldn't do it
	never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead that was no ordinary cut
	that's what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh  took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even  but it didn't work on you, an' that's why yer famous, harry
	no one ever lived after he decided ter kill 'em, no one except you, an' he'd killed some o' the best witches an' wizards of the age  the mckinnons, the bones, the prewetts  an' you was only a baby, an' you lived
	something very painful was going on in harry's mind
	as hagrid's story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before  and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life a high, cold, cruel laugh
	hagrid was watching him sadly
	took yeh from the ruined house myself, on dumbledore's orders
	brought yeh ter this lot
	load of old tosh, said uncle vernon
	harry jumped he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there
	uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage
	he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were clenched
	now, you listen here, boy, he snarled, i accept there's something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured  and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion  asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types  just what i expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end  but at that moment, hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat
	pointing this at uncle vernon like a sword, he said, i'm warning you, dursley i'm warning you  one more word
	in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, uncle vernon's courage failed again he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent
	that's better, said hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor
	harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them
	but what happened to vol, sorry  i mean, youknowwho good question, harry
	same night he tried ter kill you
	makes yeh even more famous
	that's the biggest myst'ry, see
	he was gettin' more an' more powerful  why'd he go some say he died
	codswallop, in my opinion
	dunno if he had enough human left in him to die
	some say he's still out there, bidin' his time, like, but i don' believe it
	people who was on his side came back ter ours
	some of 'em came outta kinda trances
	don reckon they could've done if he was comin' back
	most of us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers
	too weak to carry on
	'cause somethin' about you finished him, harry
	there was somethin' goin' on that night he hadn't counted on  i dunno what it was, no one does  but somethin' about you stumped him, all right
	hagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake
	a wizard him how could he possibly be he'd spent his life being clouted by dudley, and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle vernon if he was really a wizard, why hadn't they been turned into warty toads every time they'd tried to lock him in his cupboard if he'd once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football hagrid, he said quietly, i think you must have made a mistake
	i don't think i can be a wizard
	to his surprise, hagrid chuckled
	not a wizard, eh never made things happen when you was scared or angry harry looked into the fire
	now he came to think about it
	every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, harry, had been upset or angry
	chased by dudley's gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach
	dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow back
	and the very last time dudley had hit him, hadn't he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it hadn't he set a boa constrictor on him harry looked back at hagrid, smiling, and saw that hagrid was positively beaming at him
	harry potter, not a wizard  you wait, you'll be right famous at hogwarts
	but uncle vernon wasn't going to give in without a fight
	haven't i told you he's not going he hissed
	he's going to stonewall high and he'll be grateful for it
	i've read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish  spell books and wands and  if he wants ter go, a great muggle like you won't stop him, growled hagrid
	stop lily an' james potter' s son goin' ter hogwarts yer mad
	his name's been down ever since he was born
	he's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world
	seven years there and he won't know himself
	he'll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster hogwarts ever had albus dumbled i am not paying for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks yelled uncle vernon
	but he had finally gone too far
	hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, never, he thundered,  insult albus dumbledorein front of me he brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at dudley  there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain
	when he turned his back on them, harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in his trousers
	pulling aunt petunia and dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at hagrid and slammed the door behind them
	hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard
	shouldn'ta lost me temper, he said ruefully, but it didn't work anyway
	meant ter turn him into a pig, but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do
	he cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy eyebrows
	be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone at hogwarts, he said
	i'm  er  not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'
	i was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff  one o' the reasons i was so keen ter take on the job why aren't you supposed to do magic asked harry
	oh, well  i was at hogwarts meself but i  er  got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth
	they snapped me wand in half an' everything
	but dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper
	great man, dumbledore
	why were you expelled it's gettin' late and we've got lots ter do tomorrow, said hagrid loudly
	gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that
	he took off his thick black coat and threw it to harry
	you can kip under that, he said
	don' mind if it wriggles a bit, i think i still got a couple o' dormice in one o' the pockets
	chapter five diagon alley harry woke early the next morning
	although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight
	it was a dream, he told himself firmly
	i dreamed a giant called hagrid came to tell me i was going to a school for wizards
	when i open my eyes i'll be at home in my cupboard
	there was suddenly a loud tapping noise
	and there's aunt petunia knocking on the door, harry thought, his heart sinking
	but he still didn't open his eyes
	it had been such a good dream
	all right, harry mumbled, i'm getting up
	he sat up and hagrid's heavy coat fell off him
	the hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak
	harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him
	he went straight to the window and jerked it open
	the owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of hagrid, who didn't wake up
	the owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrid's coat
	harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat
	hagrid said harry loudly
	there's an owl pay him, hagrid grunted into the sofa
	what he wants payin' fer deliverin' the paper
	hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets  bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags
	finally, harry pulled out a handful of strangelooking coins
	give him five knuts, said hagrid sleepily
	knuts the little bronze ones
	harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it
	then he flew off through the open window
	hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched
	best be off, harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter london an' buy all yer stuff fer school
	harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them
	he had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture
	um  hagrid mm said hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots
	i haven't got any money  and you heard uncle vernon last night
	he won't pay for me to go and learn magic
	don't worry about that, said hagrid, standing up and scratching his head
	d'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything but if their house was destroyed  they didn' keep their gold in the house, boy nah, first stop fer us is gringotts
	have a sausage, they're not bad cold  an' i wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither
	wizards have banks just the one
	harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding
	goblins yeah  so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, i'll tell yeh that
	never mess with goblins, harry
	gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe  'cept maybe hogwarts
	as a matter o' fact, i gotta visit gringotts anyway
	hagrid drew himself up proudly
	he usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him
	fetchin' you gettin' things from gringotts  knows he can trust me, see
	got everythin' come on, then
	harry followed hagrid out onto the rock
	the sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight
	the boat uncle vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm
	how did you get here harry asked, looking around for another boat
	flew yeah  but we'll go back in this
	not s'pposed ter use magic now i've got yeh
	they settled down in the boat, harry still staring at hagrid, trying to imagine him flying
	seems a shame ter row, though, said hagrid, giving harry another of his sideways looks
	if i was ter  er  speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin' it at hogwarts of course not, said harry, eager to see more magic
	hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land
	why would you be mad to try and rob gringotts harry asked
	spells  enchantments, said hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke
	they say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults
	and then yeh gotta find yer way  gringotts is hundreds of miles under london, see
	deep under the underground
	yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat
	harry sat and thought about this while hagrid read his newspaper, the daily prophet
	harry had learned from uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never had so many questions in his life
	ministry o' magic messin' things up as usual, hagrid muttered, turning the page
	there's a ministry of magic harry asked, before he could stop himself
	'course, said hagrid
	they wanted dumbledore fer minister, 0 ' course, but he'd never leave hogwarts, so old cornelius fudge got the job
	bungler if ever there was one
	so he pelts dumbledore with owls every morning, askin' fer advice
	but what does a ministry of magic do well, their main job is to keep it from the muggles that there's still witches an' wizards up an' down the country
	why why blimey, harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their problems
	nah, we're best left alone
	at this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall
	hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street
	passersby stared a lot at hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station
	harry couldn't blame them
	not only was hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, see that, harry things these muggles dream up, eh hagrid, said harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, did you say there are dragons at gringotts well, so they say, said hagrid
	crikey, i'd like a dragon
	you'd like one wanted one ever since i was a kid  here we go
	they had reached the station
	there was a train to london in five minutes' time
	hagrid, who didn't understand muggle money, as he called it, gave the bills to harry so he could buy their tickets
	people stared more than ever on the train
	hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canaryyellow circus tent
	still got yer letter, harry he asked as he counted stitches
	harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket
	there's a list there of everything yeh need
	harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn't noticed the night before, and read hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry uniform firstyear students will require 1
	three sets of plain work robes black 2
	one plain pointed hat black for day wear 3
	one pair of protective gloves dragon hide or similar 4
	one winter cloak black, silver fastenings please note that all pupils' clothes should carry name tags course books all students should have a copy of each of the following the standard book of spells grade 1 by miranda goshawk a history of magic by bathilda bagshot magical theory by adalbert waffling a beginners' guide to transfiguration by emetic switch one thousand magical herbs and fungi by phyllida spore magical drafts and potions by arsenius jigger fantastic beasts and where to find them by newt scamander the dark forces a guide to selfprotection by quentin trimble other equipment wand cauldron pewter, standard size 2 set glass or crystal phials telescope set brass scales students may also bring an owl or a cat or a toad parents are reminded that first years are not allowed their own broomsticks can we buy all this in london harry wondered aloud
	if yeh know where to go, said hagrid
	harry had never been to london before
	although hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way
	he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow
	i don't know how the muggles manage without magic, he said as they climbed a brokendown escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops
	hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily all harry had to do was keep close behind him
	they passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand
	this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people
	could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks might this not all be some huge joke that the dursleys had cooked up if harry hadn't known that the dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so yet somehow, even though everything hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, harry couldn't help trusting him
	this is it, said hagrid, coming to a halt, the leaky cauldron
	it was a tiny, grubbylooking pub
	if hagrid hadn't pointed it out, harry wouldn't have noticed it was there
	the people hurrying by didn't glance at it
	their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the leaky cauldron at all
	in fact, harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it
	before he could mention this, hagrid had steered him inside
	for a famous place, it was very dark and shabby
	a few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry
	one of them was smoking a long pipe
	a little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut
	the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in
	everyone seemed to know hagrid they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, the usual, hagrid can't, tom, i'm on hogwarts business, said hagrid, clapping his great hand on harry's shoulder and making harry's knees buckle
	good lord, said the bartender, peering at harry, is this  can this be  the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent
	bless my soul, whispered the old bartender, harry potter
	he hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes
	potter, welcome back
	harry didn't know what to say
	everyone was looking at him
	the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out
	then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the leaky cauldron
	potter, can't believe i'm meeting you at last
	potter, i'm just so proud
	always wanted to shake your hand  i'm all of a flutter
	potter, just can't tell you, diggle's the name, dedalus diggle
	i've seen you before said harry, as dedalus diggle's top hat fell off in his excitement
	you bowed to me once in a shop
	he remembers cried dedalus diggle, looking around at everyone
	did you hear that he remembers me harry shook hands again and again  doris crockford kept coming back for more
	a pale young man made his way forward, very nervously
	one of his eyes was twitching
	professor quirrell said hagrid
	harry, professor quirrell will be one of your teachers at hogwarts
	pppotter, stammered professor quirrell, grasping harry's hand, ccan't ttell you how p pleased i am to meet you
	what sort of magic do you teach, professor quirrell ddefense against the dddark arts, muttered professor quirrell, as though he'd rather not think about it
	nnot that you nneed it, eh, pppotter he laughed nervously
	you'll be ggetting all your equipment, i suppose i've ggot to ppick up a new bbook on vampires, mmyself
	he looked terrified at the very thought
	but the others wouldn't let professor quirrell keep harry to himself
	it took almost ten minutes to get away from them all
	at last, hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble
	must get on  lots ter buy
	doris crockford shook harry's hand one last time, and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds
	hagrid grinned at harry
	told yeh, didn't i told yeh you was famous
	even professor quirrell was tremblin' ter meet yeh  mind you, he's usually tremblin'
	is he always that nervous oh, yeah
	he was fine while he was studyin' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience
	they say he met vampires in the black forest, and there was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag  never been the same since
	scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where's me umbrella vampires hags harry's head was swimming
	hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can
	two across he muttered
	right, stand back, harry
	he tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella
	the brick he had touched quivered  it wriggled  in the middle, a small hole appeared  it grew wider and wider  a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight
	welcome, said hagrid, to diagon alley
	he grinned at harry's amazement
	they stepped through the archway
	harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall
	the sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop
	cauldrons  all sizes  copper, brass, pewter, silver  selfstirring  collapsible, said a sign hanging over them
	yeah, you'll be needin' one, said hagrid, but we gotta get yer money first
	harry wished he had about eight more eyes
	he turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping
	a plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, dragon liver, seventeen sickles an ounce, they're mad
	a low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium  tawny, screech, barn, brown, and snowy
	several boys of about harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it
	look, harry heard one of them say, the new nimbus two thousand  fastest ever  there were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon
	gringotts, said hagrid
	they had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops
	standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was  yeah, that's a goblin, said hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him
	the goblin was about a head shorter than harry
	he had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, harry noticed, very long fingers and feet
	he bowed as they walked inside
	now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them enter, stranger, but take heed of what awaits the sin of greed, for those who take, but do not earn, must pay most dearly in their turn
	so if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours, thief, you have been warned, beware of finding more than treasure there
	like i said, yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, said hagrid
	a pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall
	about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses
	there were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these
	hagrid and harry made for the counter
	morning, said hagrid to a free goblin
	we've come ter take some money outta mr
	you have his key, sir got it here somewhere, said hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin's book of numbers
	the goblin wrinkled his nose
	harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals
	got it, said hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key
	the goblin looked at it closely
	that seems to be in order
	an' i've also got a letter here from professor dumbledore, said hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest
	it's about the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen
	the goblin read the letter carefully
	very well, he said, handing it back to hagrid, i will have someone take you down to both vaults
	griphook griphook was yet another goblin
	once hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and harry followed griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall
	what's the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen harry asked
	can't tell yeh that, said hagrid mysteriously
	dumbledore's trusted me
	more'n my job's worth ter tell yeh that
	griphook held the door open for them
	harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised
	they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches
	it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor
	griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them
	they climbed in  hagrid with some difficulty  and were off
	at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages
	harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible
	the rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because griphook wasn't steering
	harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open
	once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late   they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor
	i never know, harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart, what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite stalagmite's got an 'm' in it, said hagrid
	an' don' ask me questions just now, i think i'm gonna be sick
	he did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling
	griphook unlocked the door
	a lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, harry gasped
	inside were mounds of gold coins
	heaps of little bronze knuts
	all yours, smiled hagrid
	all harry's  it was incredible
	the dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking
	how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under london
	hagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bag
	the gold ones are galleons, he explained
	seventeen silver sickles to a galleon and twentynine knuts to a sickle, it's easy enough
	right, that should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe for yeh
	he turned to griphook
	vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly one speed only, said griphook
	they were going even deeper now and gathering speed
	the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners
	they went rattling over an underground ravine, and harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck
	vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole
	stand back, said griphook importantly
	he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away
	if anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there, said griphook
	how often do you check to see if anyone's inside harry asked
	about once every ten years, said griphook with a rather nasty grin
	something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least  but at first he thought it was empty
	then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor
	hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat
	harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask
	come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way back, it's best if i keep me mouth shut, said hagrid
	one wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside gringotts
	harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money
	he didn't have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole life  more money than even dudley had ever had
	might as well get yer uniform, said hagrid, nodding toward madam malkin's robes for all occasions
	listen, harry, would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a pickmeup in the leaky cauldron i hate them gringotts carts
	he did still look a bit sick, so harry entered madam malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous
	madam malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve
	hogwarts, clear she said, when harry started to speak
	got the lot here  another young man being fitted up just now, in fact
	in the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes
	madam malkin stood harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length
	hello, said the boy, hogwarts, too yes, said harry
	my father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands, said the boy
	he had a bored, drawling voice
	then i'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms
	i don't see why first years can't have their own
	i think i'll bully father into getting me one and i'll smuggle it in somehow
	harry was strongly reminded of dudley
	have you got your own broom the boy went on
	play quidditch at all no, harry said again, wondering what on earth quidditch could be
	i do  father says it's a crime if i'm not picked to play for my house, and i must say, i agree
	know what house you'll be in yet no, said harry, feeling more stupid by the minute
	well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but i know i'll be in slytherin, all our family have been  imagine being in hufflepuff, i think i'd leave, wouldn't you mmm, said harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting
	i say, look at that man said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window
	hagrid was standing there, grinning at harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in
	that's hagrid, said harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't
	he works at hogwarts
	oh, said the boy, i've heard of him
	he's a sort of servant, isn't he he's the gamekeeper, said harry
	he was liking the boy less and less every second
	i heard he's a sort of savage  lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed
	i think he's brilliant, said harry coldly
	do you said the boy, with a slight sneer
	why is he with you where are your parents they're dead, said harry shortly
	he didn't feel much like going into the matter with this boy
	oh, sorry, said the other,
	not sounding sorry at all
	but they were our kind, weren't they they were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean
	i really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you they're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways
	some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine
	i think they should keep it in the old wizarding families
	what's your surname, anyway but before harry could answer, madam malkin said, that's you done, my dear, and harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool
	well, i'll see you at hogwarts, i suppose, said the drawling boy
	harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream hagrid had bought him chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts
	what's up said hagrid
	they stopped to buy parchment and quills
	harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote
	when they had left the shop, he said, hagrid, what's quidditch blimey, harry, i keep forgettin' how little yeh know  not knowin' about quidditch don't make me feel worse, said harry
	he told hagrid about the pate boy in madam malkin's
	and he said people from muggle families shouldn't even be allowed in
	yer not from a muggle family
	if he'd known who yeh were  he's grown up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk
	you saw what everyone in the leaky cauldron was like when they saw yeh
	anyway, what does he know about it, some o' the best i ever saw were the only ones with magic in 'em in a long line 0' muggles  look at yer mum look what she had fer a sister so what is quidditch it's our sport
	it's like  like soccer in the muggle world  everyone follows quidditch  played up in the air on broomsticks and there's four balls  sorta hard ter explain the rules
	and what are slytherin and hufflepuff school houses
	everyone says hufflepuff are a lot o' duffers, but  i bet i'm in hufflepuff said harry gloomily
	better hufflepuff than slytherin, said hagrid darkly
	there's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in slytherin
	vol, sorry  youknowwho was at hogwarts years an' years ago, said hagrid
	they bought harry's school books in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all
	even dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these
	hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curses and countercurses bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies with the latest revenges hair loss, jellylegs, tongue tying and much, much more by professor vindictus viridian
	i was trying to find out how to curse dudley
	i'm not sayin' that's not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special circumstances, said hagrid
	an' anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level
	hagrid wouldn't let harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either it says pewter on yer list, but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope
	then they visited the apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages
	barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling
	while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for harry, harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twentyone galleons each and minuscule, glitteryblack beetle eyes five knuts a scoop
	outside the apothecary, hagrid checked harry's list again
	just yer wand left  a yeah, an' i still haven't got yeh a birthday present
	harry felt himself go red
	you don't have to  i know i don't have to
	tell yeh what, i'll get yer animal
	not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at  an' i don' like cats, they make me sneeze
	all the kids want owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'
	twenty minutes later, they left eeylops owl emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewelbright eyes
	harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing
	he couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like professor quirrell
	don' mention it, said hagrid gruffly
	don' expect you've had a lotta presents from them dursleys
	just ollivanders left now  only place fer wands, ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand
	this was what harry had been really looking forward to
	the last shop was narrow and shabby
	peeling gold letters over the door read ollivanders makers of fine wands since 382 b
	a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window
	a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside
	it was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait
	harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling
	for some reason, the back of his neck prickled
	the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic
	good afternoon, said a soft voice
	hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair
	an old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop
	hello, said harry awkwardly
	ah yes, said the man
	i thought i'd be seeing you soon
	it wasn't a question
	you have your mother's eyes
	it seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand
	ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow
	nice wand for charm work
	ollivander moved closer to harry
	harry wished he would blink
	those silvery eyes were a bit creepy
	your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand
	a little more power and excellent for transfiguration
	well, i say your father favored it  it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course
	ollivander had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to nose
	harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes
	ollivander touched the lightning scar on harry's forehead with a long, white finger
	i'm sorry to say i sold the wand that did it, he said softly
	thirteenandahalf inches
	powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands
	well, if i'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do
	he shook his head and then, to harry's relief, spotted hagrid
	rubeus rubeus hagrid how nice to see you again
	oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn't it it was, sir, yes, said hagrid
	but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled said mr
	ollivander, suddenly stern
	er  yes, they did, yes, said hagrid, shuffling his feet
	i've still got the pieces, though, he added brightly
	but you don't use them said mr
	oh, no, sit, said hagrid quickly
	harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke
	ollivander, giving hagrid a piercing look
	he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket
	which is your wand arm er  well, i'm righthanded, said harry
	he measured harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head
	as he measured, he said, every ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, mr
	we use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons
	no two ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same
	and of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand
	harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own
	ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes
	that will do, he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor
	beechwood and dragon heartstring
	just take it and give it a wave
	harry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit, but mr
	ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once
	maple and phoenix feather
	try  harry tried  but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by mr
	no, no here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy
	go on, go on, try it out
	he had no idea what mr
	ollivander was waiting for
	the pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands mr
	ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become
	tricky customer, eh not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here somewhere  i wonder, now   yes, why not  unusual combination  holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple
	he felt a sudden warmth in his fingers
	he raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls
	hagrid whooped and clapped and mr
	ollivander cried, oh, bravo yes, indeed, oh, very good
	he put harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, curious
	sorry, said harry, but what's curious mr
	ollivander fixed harry with his pale stare
	i remember every wand i've ever sold, mr
	it so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather  just one other
	it is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that scar
	yes, thirteenandahalf inches
	curious indeed how these things happen
	the wand chooses the wizard, remember
	i think we must expect great things from you, mr
	after all, he whomustnotbenamed did great things  terrible, yes, but great
	he wasn't sure he liked mr
	he paid seven gold galleons for his wand, and mr
	ollivander bowed them from his shop
	the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley, back through the wall, back through the leaky cauldron, now empty
	harry didn't speak at all as they walked down the road he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at them on the underground, laden as they were with all their funnyshaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on harry's lap
	up another escalator, out into paddington station harry only realized where they were when hagrid tapped him on the shoulder
	got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves, he said
	he bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them
	harry kept looking around
	everything looked so strange, somehow
	you all right, harry yer very quiet, said hagrid
	harry wasn't sure he could explain
	he'd just had the best birthday of his life  and yet  he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words
	everyone thinks i'm special, he said at last
	all those people in the leaky cauldron, professor quirrell, mr
	but i don't know anything about magic at all
	how can they expect great things i'm famous and i can't even remember what i'm famous for
	i don't know what happened when vol, sorry  i mean, the night my parents died
	hagrid leaned across the table
	behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile
	don' you worry, harry
	you'll learn fast enough
	everyone starts at the beginning at hogwarts, you'll be just fine
	yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard
	but yeh'll have a great time at hogwarts  i did  still do, 'smatter of fact
	hagrid helped harry on to the train that would take him back to the dursleys, then handed him an envelope
	yer ticket fer hogwarts,  he said
	first o' september  king's cross  it's all on yer ticket
	any problems with the dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me
	the train pulled out of the station
	harry wanted to watch hagrid until he was out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and hagrid had gone
	chapter six the journey from platform nine and threequarters harry's last month with the dursleys wasn't fun
	true, dudley was now so scared of harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while aunt petunia and uncle vernon didn't shut harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him  in fact, they didn't speak to him at all
	half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with harry in it were empty
	although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while
	harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company
	he had decided to call her hedwig, a name he had found in a history of magic
	his school books were very interesting
	he lay on his bed reading late into the night, hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased
	it was lucky that aunt petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because hedwig kept bringing back dead mice
	every night before he went to sleep, harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to september the first
	on the last day of august he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to king's cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television
	he cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and dudley screamed and ran from the room
	er  uncle vernon uncle vernon grunted to show he was listening
	er  i need to be at king's cross tomorrow to  to go to hogwarts
	uncle vernon grunted again
	would it be all right if you gave me a lift grunt
	harry supposed that meant yes
	he was about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon actually spoke
	funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train
	magic carpets all got punctures, have they harry didn't say anything
	where is this school, anyway i don't know, said harry, realizing this for the first time
	he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of his pocket
	i just take the train from platform nine and threequarters at eleven o'clock, he read
	his aunt and uncle stared
	platform what nine and threequarters
	don't talk rubbish, said uncle vernon
	there is no platform nine and threequarters
	barking, said uncle vernon, howling mad, the lot of them
	all right, we'll take you to king's cross
	we're going up to london tomorrow anyway, or i wouldn't bother
	why are you going to london harry asked, trying to keep things friendly
	taking dudley to the hospital, growled uncle vernon
	got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to smeltings
	harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep
	he got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes  he'd change on the train
	he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the dursleys to get up
	two hours later, harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the dursleys' car, aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to harry, and they had set off
	they reached king's cross at half past ten
	uncle vernon dumped harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him
	harry thought this was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face
	well, there you are, boy
	platform nine  platform ten
	your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it yet, do they he was quite right, of course
	there was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all
	have a good term, said uncle vernon with an even nastier smile
	he left without another word
	harry turned and saw the dursleys drive away
	all three of them were laughing
	harry's mouth went rather dry
	what on earth was he going to do he was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of hedwig
	he'd have to ask someone
	he stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and threequarters
	the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though harry was being stupid on purpose
	getting desperate, harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but the guard said there wasn't one
	in the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters
	harry was now trying hard not to panic
	according to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl
	hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon alley
	he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten
	at that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying
	packed with muggles, of course  harry swung round
	the speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair
	each of them was pushing a trunk like harry's in front of him  and they had an owl
	heart hammering, harry pushed his cart after them
	they stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying
	now, what's the platform number said the boys' mother
	nine and threequarters piped a small girl, also redheaded, who was holding her hand, mom, can't i go
	you're not old enough, ginny, now be quiet
	all right, percy, you go first
	what looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten
	harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it  but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished
	fred, you next, the plump woman said
	i'm not fred, i'm george, said the boy
	honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother cara you tell i'm george sorry, george, dear
	only joking, i am fred, said the boy, and off he went
	his twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone  but how had he done it now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there  and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere
	there was nothing else for it
	excuse me, harry said to the plump woman
	hello, dear, she said
	first time at hogwarts ron's new, too
	she pointed at the last and youngest of her sons
	he was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose
	the thing is  the thing is, i don't know how to  how to get onto the platform she said kindly, and harry nodded
	not to worry, she said
	all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten
	don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important
	best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous
	go on, go now before ron
	er  okay, said harry
	he pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier
	it looked very solid
	he started to walk toward it
	people jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten
	harry walked more quickly
	he was going to smash right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble  leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run  the barrier was coming nearer and nearer  he wouldn't be able to stop  the cart was out of control  he was a foot away  he closed his eyes ready for the crash  it didn't come
	a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people
	a sign overhead said hogwarts express, eleven o'clock
	harry looked behind him and saw a wroughtiron archway where the barrier had been, with the words platform nine and threequarters on it, he had done it
	smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs
	owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks
	the first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats
	harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat
	he passed a roundfaced boy who was saying, gran, i've lost my toad again
	oh, neville, he heard the old woman sigh
	a boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd
	give us a look, lee, go on
	the boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg
	harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train
	he put hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door
	he tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot
	want a hand it was one of the redhaired twins he'd followed through the barrier
	yes, please, harry panted
	oy, fred c'mere and help with the twins' help, harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment
	thanks, said harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes
	what's that said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at harry's lightning scar
	blimey, said the other twin
	are you he is, said the first twin
	aren't you he added to harry
	harry potter, chorused the twins
	the two boys gawked at him, and harry felt himself turning red
	then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door
	fred george are you there coming, mom
	with a last look at harry, the twins hopped off the train
	harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the redhaired family on the platform and hear what they were saying
	their mother had just taken out her handkerchief
	ron, you've got something on your nose
	the youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose
	mom  geroff he wriggled free
	aaah, has ickle ronnie got somefink on his nosie said one of the twins
	where's percy said their mother
	the oldest boy came striding into sight
	he had already changed into his billowing black hogwarts robes, and harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter p on it
	can't stay long, mother, he said
	i'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves  oh, are you a prefect, percy said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise
	you should have said something, we had no idea
	hang on, i think i remember him saying something about it, said the other twin
	once  or twice  a minute  all summer  oh, shut up, said percy the prefect
	how come percy gets new robes, anyway said one of the twins
	because he's a prefect, said their mother fondly
	all right, dear, well, have a good term  send me an owl when you get there
	she kissed percy on the cheek and he left
	then she turned to the twins
	now, you two  this year, you behave yourselves
	if i get one more owl telling me you've  you've blown up a toilet or  blown up a toilet we've never blown up a toilet
	great idea though, thanks, mom
	don't worry, ickle ronniekins is safe with us
	shut up, said ron again
	he was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it
	hey, mom, guess what guess who we just met on the train harry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking
	you know that blackhaired boy who was near us in the station know who he is who harry potter harry heard the little girl's voice
	oh, mom, can i go on the train and see him, mom, eh please
	you've already seen him, ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo
	is he really, fred how do you know asked him
	it's really there  like lightning
	poor dear  no wonder he was alone, i wondered
	he was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform
	never mind that, do you think he remembers what youknowwho looks like their mother suddenly became very stern
	i forbid you to ask him, fred
	as though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school
	all right, keep your hair on
	hurry up their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train
	they leaned out of the window for her to kiss them goodbye, and their younger sister began to cry
	don't, ginny, we'll send you loads of owls
	we'll send you a hogwarts toilet seat
	george only joking, mom
	the train began to move
	harry saw the boys' mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved
	harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner
	houses flashed past the window
	harry felt a great leap of excitement
	he didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind
	the door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in
	anyone sitting there he asked, pointing at the seat opposite harry
	everywhere else is full
	harry shook his head and the boy sat down
	he glanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked
	harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose
	listen, we're going down the middle of the train  lee jordan's got a giant tarantula down there
	harry, said the other twin, did we introduce ourselves fred and george weasley
	and this is ron, our brother
	bye, said harry and ron
	the twins slid the compartment door shut behind them
	are you really harry potter ron blurted out
	oh well, i thought it might be one of fred and george's jokes, said ron
	and have you really got  you know
	he pointed at harry's forehead
	harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar
	so that's where youknowwho yes, said harry, but i can't remember it
	nothing said ron eagerly
	well  i remember a lot of green light, but nothing else
	he sat and stared at harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again
	are all your family wizards asked harry, who found ron just as interesting as ron found him
	er  yes, i think so, said ron
	i think mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him
	so you must know loads of magic already
	the weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in diagon alley had talked about
	i heard you went to live with muggles, said ron
	what are they like horrible well, not all of them
	my aunt and uncle and cousin are, though
	wish i'd had three wizard brothers
	for some reason, he was looking gloomy
	i'm the sixth in our family to go to hogwarts
	you could say i've got a lot to live up to
	bill and charlie have already left  bill was head boy and charlie was captain of quidditch
	now percy's a prefect
	fred and george mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny
	everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if i do, it's no big deal, because they did it first
	you never get anything new, either, with five brothers
	i've got bill's old robes, charlie's old wand, and percy's old rat
	ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep
	his name's scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up
	percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff  i mean, i got scabbers instead
	ron's ears went pink
	he seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window
	harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl
	after all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told ron so, all about having to wear dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents
	this seemed to cheer ron up
	and until hagrid told me, i didn't know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or voldemort ron gasped
	you said youknowwho's name said ron, sounding both shocked and impressed
	i'd have thought you, of all people  i'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name, said harry, i just never knew you shouldn't
	see what i mean i've got loads to learn
	i bet, he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, i bet i'm the worst in the class
	there's loads of people who come from muggle families and they learn quick enough
	while they had been talking, the train had carried them out of london
	now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep
	they were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past
	around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, anything off the cart, dears harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but ron's ears went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches
	harry went out into the corridor
	he had never had any money for candy with the dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry  but the woman didn't have mars bars
	what she did have were bettie bott's every flavor beans, drooble's best blowing gum, chocolate frogs
	pumpkin pasties, cauldron cakes, licorice wands, and a number of other strange things harry had never seen in his life
	not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze knuts
	ron stared as harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat
	hungry, are you starving, said harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty
	ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it
	there were four sandwiches inside
	he pulled one of them apart and said, she always forgets i don't like corned beef
	swap you for one of these, said harry, holding up a pasty
	go on  you don't want this, it's all dry, said ron
	she hasn't got much time, he added quickly, you know, with five of us
	go on, have a pasty, said harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with
	it was a nice feeling, sitting there with ron, eating their way through all harry's pasties, cakes, and candies the sandwiches lay forgotten
	what are these harry asked ron, holding up a pack of chocolate frogs
	they're not really frogs, are they he was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him
	but see what the card is
	what oh, of course, you wouldn't know  chocolate frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect  famous witches and wizards
	i've got about five hundred, but i haven't got agrippa or ptolemy
	harry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up the card
	it showed a man's face
	he wore half moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache
	underneath the picture was the name albus dumbledore
	so this is dumbledore said harry
	don't tell me you'd never heard of dumbledore said ron
	can i have a frog i might get agrippa  thanks harry turned over his card and read albus dumbledore currently headmaster of hogwarts considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, nicolas flamel
	professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling
	harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that dumbledore's face had disappeared
	he's gone well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, said ron
	no, i've got morgana again and i've got about six of her
	do you want it you can start collecting
	ron's eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be unwrapped
	help yourself, said harry
	but in, you know, the muggle world, people just stay put in photos
	do they what, they don't move at all ron sounded amazed
	weird harry stared as dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile
	ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards, but harry couldn't keep his eyes off them
	soon he had not only dumbledore and morgana, but hengist of woodcroft, alberic grunnion, circe, paracelsus, and merlin
	he finally tore his eyes away from the druidess cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of bertie bott's every flavor beans
	you want to be careful with those, ron warned harry
	when they say every flavor, they mean every flavor  you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe
	george reckons he had a boogerflavored one once
	ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner
	bleaaargh  see sprouts
	they had a good time eating the every flavor beans
	harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper
	the countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder
	the neat fields had gone
	now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills
	there was a knock on the door of their compartment and the roundfaced boy harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in
	sorry, he said, but have you seen a toad at all when they shook their heads, he wailed, i've lost him he keeps getting away from me he'll turn up, said harry
	yes, said the boy miserably
	well, if you see him
	don't know why he's so bothered, said ron
	if i'd brought a toad i'd lose it as quick as i could
	mind you, i brought scabbers, so i can't talk
	the rat was still snoozing on ron's lap
	he might have died and you wouldn't know the difference, said ron in disgust
	i tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn't work
	he rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very batteredlooking wand
	it was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end
	unicorn hair's nearly poking out
	anyway he had just raised his 'wand when the compartment door slid open again
	the toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him
	she was already wearing her new hogwarts robes
	has anyone seen a toad neville's lost one, she said
	she had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth
	we've already told him we haven't seen it, said ron, but the girl wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand
	oh, are you doing magic let's see it, then
	ron looked taken aback
	he cleared his throat
	sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, turn this stupid, fat rat yellow
	he waved his wand, but nothing happened
	scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep
	are you sure that's a real spell said the girl
	well, it's not very good, is it i've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me
	nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when i got my letter, but i was ever so pleased, of course, i mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, i've heard  i've learned all our course books by heart, of course, i just hope it will be enough  i'm hermione granger, by the way, who are you
	she said all this very fast
	harry looked at ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learned all the course books by heart either
	i'm ron weasley, ron muttered
	harry potter, said harry
	are you really said hermione
	i know all about you, of course  i got a few extra books
	for background reading, and you're in modern magical history and the rise and fall of the dark arts and great wizarding events of the twentieth century
	am i said harry, feeling dazed
	goodness, didn't you know, i'd have found out everything i could if it was me, said hermione
	do either of you know what house you'll be in i've been asking around, and i hope i'm in gryffindor, it sounds by far the best i hear dumbledore himself was in it, but i suppose ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad
	anyway, we'd better go and look for neville's toad
	you two had better change, you know, i expect we'll be there soon
	and she left, taking the toadless boy with her
	whatever house i'm in, i hope she's not in it, said ron
	he threw his wand back into his trunk
	stupid spell  george gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud
	what house are your brothers in asked harry
	gryffindor, said ron
	gloom seemed to be settling on him again
	mom and dad were in it, too
	i don't know what they'll say if i'm not
	i don't suppose ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in slytherin
	that's the house vol, i mean, youknowwho was in yeah, said ron
	he flopped back into his seat, looking depressed
	you know, i think the ends of scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter, said harry, trying to take ron's mind off houses
	so what do your oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school
	charlie's in romania studying dragons, and bill's in africa doing something for gringotts, said ron
	did you hear about gringotts it's been all over the daily prophet, but i don't suppose you get that with the muggles  someone tried to rob a high security vault
	really what happened to them nothing, that's why it's such big news
	they haven't been caught
	my dad says it must've been a powerful dark wizard to get round gringotts, but they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd
	'course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case youknowwho's behind it
	harry turned this news over in his mind
	he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time you knowwho was mentioned
	he supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying voldemort without worrying
	what's your quidditch team ron asked
	er  i don't know any, harry confessed
	what ron looked dumbfounded
	oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world  and he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money
	he was just taking harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't neville the toadless boy, or hermione granger this time
	three boys entered, and harry recognized the middle one at once it was the pale boy from madam malkin's robe shop
	he was looking at harry with a lot more interest than he'd shown back in diagon alley
	they're saying all down the train that harry potter's in this compartment
	so it's you, is it yes, said harry
	he was looking at the other boys
	both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean
	standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards
	oh, this is crabbe and this is goyle, said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where harry was looking
	and my name's malfoy, draco malfoy
	ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget
	draco malfoy looked at him
	think my name's funny, do you no need to ask who you are
	my father told me all the weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford
	he turned back to harry
	you'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, potter
	you don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort
	i can help you there
	he held out his hand to shake harry's, but harry didn't take it
	i think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks, he said coolly
	draco malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks
	i'd be careful if i were you, potter, he said slowly
	unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents
	they didn't know what was good for them, either
	you hang around with riffraff like the weasleys and that hagrid, and it'll rub off on you
	both harry and ron stood up
	say that again, ron said, his face as red as his hair
	oh, you're going to fight us, are you malfoy sneered
	unless you get out now, said harry, more bravely than he felt, because crabbe and goyle were a lot bigger than him or ron
	but we don't feet like leaving, do we, boys we've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some
	goyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ron  ron leapt forward, but before he'd so much as touched goyle, goyle let out a horrible yell
	scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyle's knuckle  crabbe and malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round and round, howling, and when scabbets finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once
	perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps, because a second later, hermione granger had come in
	what has been going on she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers by his tail
	i think he's been knocked out, ron said to harry
	he looked closer at scabbers
	no  i don't believe it  he's gone back to sleep and so he had
	you've met malfoy before harry explained about their meeting in diagon alley
	i've heard of his family, said ron darkly
	they were some of the first to come back to our side after youknowwho disappeared
	said they'd been bewitched
	my dad doesn't believe it
	he says malfoy's father didn't need an excuse to go over to the dark side
	he turned to hermione
	can we help you with something you'd better hurry up and put your robes on, i've just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there
	you haven't been fighting, have you you'll be in trouble before we even get there scabbers has been fighting, not us, said ron, scowling at her
	would you mind leaving while we change all right  i only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors, said hermione in a sniffy voice
	and you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know ron glared at her as she left
	harry peered out of the window
	he could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky
	the train did seem to be slowing down
	he and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes
	ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them
	a voice echoed through the train we will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes' time
	please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately
	harry's stomach lurched with nerves and ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles
	they crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor
	the train slowed right down and finally stopped
	people pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform
	harry shivered in the cold night air
	then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and harry heard a familiar voice firs' years firs' years over here all right there, harry hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads
	c'mon, follow me  any more firs' years mind yer step, now firs' years follow me slipping and stumbling, they followed hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path
	it was so dark on either side of them that harry thought there must be thick trees there
	neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice
	ye' all get yer firs' sight o' hogwarts in a sec, hagrid called over his shoulder, jus' round this bend here
	there was a loud oooooh the narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take
	perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers
	no more'n four to a boat hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore
	harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and hermione
	everyone in shouted hagrid, who had a boat to himself
	right then  forward and the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass
	everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead
	it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood
	heads down yelled hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face
	they were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles
	oy, you there is this your toad said hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them
	trevor cried neville blissfully, holding out his hands
	then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle
	they walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door
	everyone here you there, still got yer toad hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door
	chapter seven the sorting hat the door swung open at once
	a tall, blackhaired witch in emeraldgreen robes stood there
	she had a very stern face and harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross
	the firs' years, professor mcgonagall, said hagrid
	i will take them from here
	she pulled the door wide
	the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys' house in it
	the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors
	they followed professor mcgonagall across the flagged stone floor
	harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here  but professor mcgonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall
	they crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously
	welcome to hogwarts, said professor mcgonagall
	the startofterm banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the great hall, you will be sorted into your houses
	the sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within hogwarts
	you will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room
	the four houses are called gryffindor, hufflepuff, ravenclaw, and slytherin
	each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards
	while you are at hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points
	at the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor
	i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours
	the sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school
	i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting
	her eyes lingered for a moment on neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on ron's smudged nose
	harry nervously tried to flatten his hair
	i shall return when we are ready for you, said professor mcgonagall
	she left the chamber
	how exactly do they sort us into houses he asked ron
	some sort of test, i think
	fred said it hurts a lot, but i think he was joking
	harry's heart gave a horrible jolt
	a test in front of the whole school but he didn't know any magic yet  what on earth would he have to do he hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived
	he looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too
	no one was talking much except hermione granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need
	harry tried hard not to listen to her
	he'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue
	he kept his eyes fixed on the door
	any second now, professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his doom
	then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air  several people behind him screamed
	so did the people around him
	about twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall
	pearlywhite and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years
	they seemed to be arguing
	what looked like a fat little monk was saying forgive and forget, i say, we ought to give him a second chance  my dear friar, haven't we given peeves all the chances he deserves he gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost  i say, what are you all doing here a ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years
	new students said the fat friar, smiling around at them
	about to be sorted, i suppose a few people nodded mutely
	hope to see you in hufflepuff said the friar
	my old house, you know
	move along now, said a sharp voice
	the sorting ceremony's about to start
	professor mcgonagall had returned
	one by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall
	now, form a line, professor mcgonagall told the first years, and follow me
	feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the great hall
	harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place
	it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting
	these tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets
	at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting
	professor mcgonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them
	the hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight
	dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver
	mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars
	he heard hermione whisper, its bewitched to look like the sky outside
	i read about it in hogwarts, a history
	it was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the great hall didn't simply open on to the heavens
	harry quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed a fourlegged stool in front of the first years
	on top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat
	this hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty
	aunt petunia wouldn't have let it in the house
	maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing  noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too
	for a few seconds, there was complete silence
	then the hat twitched
	a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth  and the hat began to sing oh, you may not think i'm pretty, but don't judge on what you see, i'll eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me
	you can keep your bowlers black, your top hats sleek and tall, for i'm the hogwarts sorting hat and i can cap them all
	there's nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat can't see, so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to be
	you might belong in gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart, their daring, nerve, and chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong in hufflepuff, where they are just and loyal, those patient hufflepuffis are true and unafraid of toil or yet in wise old ravenclaw, if you've a ready mind, where those of wit and learning, will always find their kind or perhaps in slytherin you'll make your real friends, those cunning folk use any means to achieve their ends
	so put me on don't be afraid and don't get in a flap you're in safe hands though i have none for i'm a thinking cap the whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song
	it bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again
	so we've just got to try on the hat ron whispered to harry
	i'll kill fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll
	yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching
	the hat seemed to be asking rather alot harry didn't feel brave or quickwitted or any of it at the moment
	if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him
	professor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment
	when i call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted, she said
	abbott, hannah a pinkfaced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down
	a moments pause  hufflepuff shouted the hat
	the table on the right cheered and clapped as hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table
	harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at her
	bones, susan hufflepuff shouted the hat again, and susan scuttled off to sit next to hannah
	boot, terry ravenclaw the table second from the left clapped this time several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with terry as he joined them
	brocklehurst, mandy went to ravenclaw too, but brown, lavender became the first new gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers harry could see ron's twin brothers catcalling
	bulstrode, millicent then became a slytherin
	perhaps it was harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot
	he was starting to feel definitely sick now
	he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school
	he had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted dudley to think they liked him
	finchfletchley, justin hufflepuff sometimes, harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide
	finnigan, seamus, the sandyhaired boy next to harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a gryffindor
	granger, hermione hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head
	gryffindor shouted the hat
	a horrible thought struck harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous
	what if he wasn't chosen at all what if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train when neville longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool
	the hat took a long time to decide with neville
	when it finally shouted, gryffindor, neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to macdougal, morag
	malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, slytherin malfoy went to join his friends crabbe and goyle, looking pleased with himself
	there weren't many people left now
	moon nott parkinson then a pair of twin girls, patil and patil then perks, sallyanne and then, at last  potter, harry as harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall
	potter, did she say the harry potter the last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him
	next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat
	hmm, said a small voice in his ear
	plenty of courage, i see
	not a bad mind either
	there's talent, a my goodness, yes  and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting
	so where shall i put you harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, not slytherin, not slytherin
	not slytherin, eh said the small voice
	are you sure you could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that  no well, if you're sure  better be gryffindor harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall
	he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the gryffindor table
	he was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet
	percy the prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the weasley twins yelled, we got potter we got potter harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier
	the ghost patted his arm, giving harry the sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of icecold water
	he could see the high table properly now
	at the end nearest him sat hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up
	and there, in the center of the high table, in a large gold chair, sat albus dumbledore
	harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train
	dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts
	harry spotted professor quirtell, too, the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron
	he was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban
	and now there were only three people left to be sorted
	thomas, dean, a black boy even taller than ron, joined harry at the gryffindor table
	turpin, lisa, became a ravenclaw and then it was ron's turn
	he was pale green by now
	harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, gryffindor harry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed into the chair next to him
	well done, ron, excellent, said percy weasley pompously across harry as zabini, blaise, was made a slytherin
	professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll and took the sorting hat away
	harry looked down at his empty gold plate
	he had only just realized how hungry he was
	the pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago
	albus dumbledore had gotten to his feet
	he was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there
	welcome to a new year at hogwarts before we begin our banquet, i would like to say a few words
	and here they are nitwit blubber oddment tweak thank you he sat back down
	everybody clapped and cheered
	harry didn't know whether to laugh or not
	is he  a bit mad he asked percy uncertainly
	mad said percy airily
	he's a genius best wizard in the world but he is a bit mad, yes
	potatoes, harry harry's mouth fell open
	the dishes in front of him were now piled with food
	he had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs
	the dursleys had never exactly starved harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked
	dudley had always taken anything that harry really wanted, even if it made him sick
	harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat
	it was all delicious
	that does look good, said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching harry cut up his steak, can't you  i haven't eaten for nearly four hundred years, said the ghost
	i don't need to, of course, but one does miss it
	i don't think i've in troduced myself sir nicholas de mimsyporpington at your service
	resident ghost of gryffindor tower
	i know who you are said ron suddenly
	my brothers told me about you  you're nearly headless nick i would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy  the ghost began stiffly, but sandyhaired seamus finnigan interrupted
	nearly headless how can you be nearly headless sir nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted
	like this, he said irritably
	he seized his left ear and pulled
	his whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge
	someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly
	looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, nearly headless nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, so  new gryffindors i hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year gryffindors have never gone so long without winning
	slytherins have got the cup six years in a row the bloody baron's becoming almost unbearable  he's the slytherin ghost
	harry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood
	he was right next to malfoy who, harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements
	how did he get covered in blood asked seamus with great interest
	i've never asked, said nearly headless nick delicately
	when everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before
	a moment later the desserts appeared
	blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, jello, rice pudding   as harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families
	i'm halfandhalf, said seamus
	mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married
	bit of a nasty shock for him
	what about you, neville said ron
	well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch, said neville, but the family thought i was all muggle for ages
	my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me  he pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once, i nearly drowned  but nothing happened until i was eight
	great uncle algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my great auntie enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go
	but i bounced  all the way down the garden and into the road
	they were all really pleased, gran was crying, she was so happy
	and you should have seen their faces when i got in here  they thought i might not be magic enough to come, you see
	great uncle algie was so pleased he bought me my toad
	on harry's other side, percy weasley and hermione were talking about lessons i do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, i'm particularly interested in transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult you'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing
	harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the high table again
	hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet
	professor mcgonagall was talking to professor dumbledore
	professor quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin
	it happened very suddenly
	the hooknosed teacher looked past quirrell's turban straight into harry's eyes  and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on harry's forehead
	ouch harry clapped a hand to his head
	what is it asked percy
	the pain had gone as quickly as it had come
	harder to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the teacher's look  a feeling that he didn't like harry at all
	who's that teacher talking to professor quirrell he asked percy
	oh, you know quirrell already, do you no wonder he's looking so nervous, that's professor snape
	he teaches potions, but he doesn't want to  everyone knows he's after quirrell's job
	knows an awful lot about the dark arts, snape
	harry watched snape for a while, but snape didn't look at him again
	at last, the desserts too disappeared, and professor dumbledore got to his feet again
	the hall fell silent
	ahern  just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered
	i have a few startofterm notices to give you
	first years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils
	and a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well
	dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the weasley twins
	i have also been asked by mr
	filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors
	quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term
	anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact madam hooch
	and finally, i must tell you that this year, the thirdfloor corridor on the righthand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death
	harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did
	he's not serious he muttered to percy
	must be, said percy, frowning at dumbledore
	it's odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere  the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that
	i do think he might have told us prefects, at least
	and now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song cried dumbledore
	harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed
	dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words
	everyone pick their favorite tune, said dumbledore, and off we go and the school bellowed hogwarts, hogwarts, hoggy warty hogwarts, teach us something please, whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knees, our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff, for now they're bare and full of air, dead flies and bits of fluff, so teach us things worth knowing, bring back what we've forgot, just do your best, we'll do the rest, and learn until our brains all rot
	everybody finished the song at different times
	at last, only the weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march
	dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest
	ah, music, he said, wiping his eyes
	a magic beyond all we do here and now, bedtime
	off you trot the gryffindor first years followed percy through the chattering crowds, out of the great hall, and up the marble staircase
	harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food
	he was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries
	they climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt
	a bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him
	peeves, percy whispered to the first years
	he raised his voice, peeves  show yourself a loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered
	do you want me to go to the bloody baron there was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks
	oooooooh he said, with an evil cackle
	ickle firsties what fun he swooped suddenly at them
	go away, peeves, or the baron'll hear about this, i mean it barked percy
	peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on neville's head
	they heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed
	you want to watch out for peeves, said percy, as they set off again
	the bloody baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects
	at the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress
	caput draconis, said percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall
	they all scrambled through it  neville needed a leg up  and found themselves in the gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs
	percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another
	at the top of a spiral staircase  they were obviously in one of the towers  they found their beds at last five fourposters hung with deep red, velvet curtains
	their trunks had already been brought up
	too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed
	great food, isn't it ron muttered to harry through the hangings
	get off, scabbers he's chewing my sheets
	harry was going to ask ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once
	perhaps harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream
	he was wearing professor quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to slytherin at once, because it was his destiny
	harry told the turban he didn't want to be in slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully  and there was malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it then malfoy turned into the hooknosed teacher, snape, whose laugh became high and cold  there was a burst of green light and harry woke, sweating and shaking
	he rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all
	chapter eight the potions master there, look
	where next to the tall kid with the red hair
	wearing the glasses did you see his face did you see his scar whispers followed harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day
	people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring
	harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes
	there were a hundred and fortytwo staircases at hogwarts wide, sweeping ones narrow, rickety ones some that led somewhere different on a friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump
	then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending
	it was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot
	the people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and harry was sure the coats of armor could walk
	the ghosts didn't help, either
	it was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open
	nearly headless nick was always happy to point new gryffindors in the right direction, but peeves the poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class
	he would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, got your conk even worse than peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, argus filch
	harry and ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning
	filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the outofbounds corridor on the third floor
	he wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by professor quirrell, who was passing
	filch owned a cat called mrs
	norris, a scrawny, dustcolored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like filch's
	she patrolled the corridors alone
	break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later
	filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone except perhaps the weasley twins and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts
	the students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give mrs
	and then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves
	there was a lot more to magic, as harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words
	they had to study the night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets
	three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology, with a dumpy little witch called professor sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for
	easily the most boring class was history of magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost
	professor binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him
	binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got emetic the evil and uric the oddball mixed up
	professor flitwick, the charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk
	at the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight
	professor mcgonagall was again different
	harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross
	strict and clever, she gave them a talkingto the moment they sat down in her first class
	transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts, she said
	anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back
	you have been warned
	then she changed her desk into a pig and back again
	they were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time
	after taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle
	by the end of the lesson, only hermione granger had made any difference to her match professor mcgonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave hermione a rare smile
	the class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against the dark arts, but quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke
	his classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days
	his turban, he told them, had been given to him by an african prince as a thankyou for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story
	for one thing, when seamus finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had fought off the zombie, quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that quirrell was protected wherever he went
	harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else
	lots of people had come from muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards
	there was so much to learn that even people like ron didn't have much of a head start
	friday was an important day for harry and ron
	they finally managed to find their way down to the great hall for breakfast without getting lost once
	what have we got today harry asked ron as he poured sugar on his porridge
	double potions with the slytherins, said ron
	snape's head of slytherin house
	they say he always favors them  we'll be able to see if it's true
	wish mcgonagall favored us,  said harry
	professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before
	just then, the mail arrived
	harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the great hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps
	hedwig hadn't brought harry anything so far
	she sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls
	this morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto harry's plate
	harry tore it open at once
	it said, in a very untidy scrawl dear harry, i know you get friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three i want to hear all about your first week
	send us an answer back with hedwig
	hagrid harry borrowed ron's quill, scribbled yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent hedwig off again
	it was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look forward to, because the potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far
	at the startofterm banquet, harry had gotten the idea that professor snape disliked him
	by the end of the first potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong
	snape didn't dislike harry  he hated him
	potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons
	it was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls
	snape, like flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like flitwick, he paused at harry's name
	ah, yes, he said softly, harry potter
	draco malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle sniggered behind their hands
	snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class
	his eyes were black like hagrid's, but they had none of hagrid's warmth
	they were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels
	you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking, he began
	he spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word  like professor mcgonagall, snape had y caught every word  like professor mcgonagall, snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort
	as there is little foolish wandwaving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic
	i don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses
	i can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death  if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to teach
	more silence followed this little speech
	harry and ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows
	hermione granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead
	potter said snape suddenly
	what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood powdered root of what to an infusion of what harry glanced at ron, who looked as stumped as he was hermione's hand had shot into the air
	i don't know, sit, said harry
	snape's lips curled into a sneer
	tut, tut  fame clearly isn't everything
	he ignored hermione's hand
	potter, where would you look if i told you to find me a bezoar hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was
	he tried not to look at malfoy, crabbe, and goyle, who were shaking with laughter
	thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, potter harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes
	he had looked through his books at the dursleys', but did snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and fungi snape was still ignoring hermione's quivering hand
	what is the difference, potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane at this, hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling
	i don't know, said harry quietly
	i think hermione does, though, why don't you try her a few people laughed harry caught seamus's eye, and seamus winked
	snape, however, was not pleased
	sit down, he snapped at hermione
	for your information, potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living death
	a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons
	as for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite
	well why aren't you all copying that down there was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment
	over the noise, snape said, and a point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek, potter
	things didn't improve for the gryffindors as the potions lesson continued
	snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils
	he swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except malfoy, whom he seemed to like
	he was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon
	neville had somehow managed to melt seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes
	within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs
	idiot boy snarled snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand
	i suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose
	take him up to the hospital wing, snape spat at seamus
	then he rounded on harry and ron, who had been working next to neville
	you  potter  why didn't you tell him not to add the quills thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you that's another point you've lost for gryffindor
	this was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to argue, but ron kicked him behind their cauldron
	doi push it, he muttered, i've heard snape can turn very nasty
	as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low
	he'd lost two points for gryffindor in his very first week  why did snape hate him so much cheer up, said ron, snape's always taking points off fred and george
	can i come and meet hagrid with you at five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds
	hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest
	a crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door
	when harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks
	then hagrid's voice rang out, saying, back, fang  back
	hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open
	he let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound
	there was only one room inside
	hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it
	make yerselves at home, said hagrid, letting go of fang, who bounded straight at ron and started licking his ears
	like hagrid, fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked
	this is ron, harry told hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate
	another weasley, eh said hagrid, glancing at ron's freckles
	i spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest
	the rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but harry and ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told hagrid all about their first lessons
	fang rested his head on harry's knee and drooled all over his robes
	harry and ron were delighted to hear hagrid call fitch that old git
	an' as fer that cat, mrs
	norris, i'd like ter introduce her to fang sometime
	d'yeh know, every time i go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere can't get rid of her  fitch puts her up to it
	harry told hagrid about snape's lesson
	hagrid, like ron, told harry not to worry about it, that snape liked hardly any of the students
	but he seemed to really hate me
	why should he yet harry couldn't help thinking that hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that
	how's yer brother charlie hagrid asked ron
	i liked him a lot  great with animals
	harry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on purpose
	while ron told hagrid all about charlie's work with dragons, harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy
	it was a cutting from the daily prophet gringotts breakin latest investigations continue into the breakin at gringotts on 31 july, widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknown
	gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken
	the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day
	but we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you, said a gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon
	harry remembered ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob gringotts, but ron hadn't mentioned the date
	hagrid said harry, that gringotts breakin happened on my birthday it might've been happening while we were there there was no doubt about it, hagrid definitely didn't meet harry's eyes this time
	he grunted and offered him another rock cake
	harry read the story again
	the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day
	hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package
	had that been what the thieves were looking for as harry and ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with hagrid
	had hagrid collected that package just in time where was it now and did hagrid know something about snape that he didn't want to tell harry chapter nine the midnight duel harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than dudley, but that was before he met draco malfoy
	still, firstyear gryffindors only had potions with the slytherins, so they didn't have to put up with malfoy much
	or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor common room that made them all groan
	flying lessons would be starting on thursday  and gryffindor and slytherin would be learning together
	typical, said harry darkly
	just what i always wanted
	to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of malfoy
	he had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else
	you don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself, said ron reasonably
	anyway, i know malfoy's always going on about how good he is at quidditch, but i bet that's all talk
	malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot
	he complained loudly about first years never getting on the house quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in helicopters
	he wasn't the only one, though the way seamus finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick
	even ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on charlie's old broom
	everyone from wizarding families talked about quidditch constantly
	ron had already had a big argument with dean thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer
	ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly
	harry had caught ron prodding dean's poster of west ham soccer team, trying to make the players move
	neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one
	privately, harry felt she'd had good reason, because neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground
	hermione granger was almost as nervous about flying as neville was
	this was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book  not that she hadn't tried
	at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called quidditch through the ages
	neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail
	harry hadn't had a single letter since hagrid's note, something that malfoy had been quick to notice, of course
	malfoy's eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the slytherin table
	a barn owl brought neville a small package from his grandmother
	he opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke
	it's a remembrall he explained
	gran knows i forget things  this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do
	look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red  oh
	his face fell, because the remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, you've forgotten something
	neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when draco malfoy, who was passing the gryffindor table, snatched the remembrall out of his hand
	harry and ron jumped to their feet
	they were half hoping for a reason to fight malfay, but professor mcgonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash
	what's going on malfoy's got my remembrall, professor
	scowling, malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall back on the table
	just looking, he said, and he sloped away with crabbe and goyle behind him
	at threethirty that afternoon, harry, ron, and the other gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson
	it was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance
	the slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground
	harry had heard fred and george weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left
	their teacher, madam hooch, arrived
	she had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk
	well, what are you all waiting for she barked
	everyone stand by a broomstick
	harry glanced down at his broom
	it was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles
	stick out your right hand over your broom, called madam hooch at the front, and say 'up' upf everyone shouted
	harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did
	hermione granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and neville's hadn't moved at all
	perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought harry there was a quaver in neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground
	madam hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips
	harry and ron were delighted when she told malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years
	now, when i blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard, said madam hooch
	keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly
	on my whistle  three  two  but neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched madam hooch's lips
	come back, boy she shouted, but neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle  twelve feet  twenty feet
	harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and  wham  a thud and a nasty crack and neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap
	his broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight
	madam hooch was bending over neville, her face as white as his
	broken wrist, harry heard her mutter
	come on, boy  it's all right, up you get
	she turned to the rest of the class
	none of you is to move while i take this boy to the hospital wing you leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of hogwarts before you can say 'quidditch
	neville, his face tearstreaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with madam hooch, who had her arm around him
	no sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst into laughter
	did you see his face, the great lump the other slytherins joined in
	shut up, malfoy, snapped parvati patil
	ooh, sticking up for longbottom said pansy parkinson, a hardfaced slytherin girl
	never thought you'd like fat little crybabies, parvati
	look said malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass
	it's that stupid thing longbottom's gran sent him
	the remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up
	give that here, malfoy, said harry quietly
	everyone stopped talking to watch
	malfoy smiled nastily
	i think i'll leave it somewhere for longbottom to find  how about  up a tree give it here harry yelled, but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off
	he hadn't been lying, he could fly well
	hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, come and get it, potter harry grabbed his broom
	no shouted hermione granger
	madam hooch told us not to move  you'll get us all into trouble
	blood was pounding in his ears
	he mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught  this was easy, this was wonderful
	he pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from ron
	he turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in midair
	malfoy looked stunned
	give it here, harry called, or i'll knock you off that broom oh, yeah said malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried
	harry knew, somehow, what to do
	he leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward malfay like a javelin
	malfoy only just got out of the way in time harry made a sharp aboutface and held the broom steady
	a few people below were clapping
	no crabbe and goyle up here to save your neck, malfoy, harry called
	the same thought seemed to have struck malfoy
	catch it if you can, then he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground
	harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall
	he leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down  next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball  wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching  he stretched out his hand  a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in his fist
	harry potter his heart sank faster than he'd just dived
	professor mcgonagall was running toward them
	he got to his feet, trembling
	never  in all my time at hogwarts  professor mcgonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously,  how dare you  might have broken your neck  it wasn't his fault, professor  be quiet, miss patil but malfoy  that's enough, mr
	potter, follow me, now
	harry caught sight of malfoy, crabbe, and goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in professor mcgonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle
	he was going to be expelled, he just knew it
	he wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice
	professor mcgonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him he had to jog to keep up
	he hadn't even lasted two weeks
	he'd be packing his bags in ten minutes
	what would the dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still professor mcgonagall didn't say a word to him
	she wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with harry trotting miserably behind her
	maybe she was taking him to dumbledore
	he thought of hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper
	perhaps he could be hagrid's assistant
	his stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying hagrid's bag
	professor mcgonagall stopped outside a classroom
	she opened the door and poked her head inside
	excuse me, professor flitwick, could i borrow wood for a moment wood thought harry, bewildered was wood a cane she was going to use on him but wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifthyear boy who came out of flitwicles class looking confused
	follow me, you two, said professor mcgonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, wood looking curiously at harry
	professor mcgonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard
	out, peeves she barked
	peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing
	professor mcgonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys
	potter, this is oliver wood
	wood  i've found you a seeker
	wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight
	are you serious, professor absolutely, said professor mcgonagall crisply
	i've never seen anything like it
	was that your first time on a broomstick, potter harry nodded silently
	he didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs
	he caught that thing in his hand after a fiftyfoot dive, professor mcgonagall told wood
	didn't even scratch himself
	charlie weasley couldn't have done it
	wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once
	ever seen a game of quidditch, potter he asked excitedly
	wood's captain of the gryffindor team, professor mcgonagall explained
	he's just the build for a seeker, too, said wood, now walking around harry and staring at him
	light  speedy  we'll have to get him a decent broom, professor  a nimbus two thousand or a cleansweep seven, i'd say
	i shall speak to professor dumbledore and see if we can't bend the firstyear rule
	heaven knows, we need a better team than last year
	flattened in that last match by slytherin, i couldn't look severus snape in the face for weeks
	professor mcgonagall peered sternly over her glasses at harry
	i want to hear you're training hard, potter, or i may change my mind about punishing you
	then she suddenly smiled
	your father would have been proud, she said
	he was an excellent quidditch player himself
	harry had just finished telling ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with professor mcgonagall
	ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about it
	but first years never  you must be the youngest house player in about a century, said harry, shoveling pie into his mouth
	he felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon
	ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at harry
	i start training next week, said harry
	only don't tell anyone, wood wants to keep it a secret
	fred and george weasley now came into the hall, spotted harry, and hurried over
	well done, said george in a low voice
	we're on the team too  beaters
	i tell you, we're going to win that quidditch cup for sure this year, said fred
	we haven't won since charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant
	you must be good, harry, wood was almost skipping when he told us
	anyway, we've got to go, lee jordan reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school
	bet it's that one behind the statue of gregory the smarmy that we found in our first week
	fred and george had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up malfoy, flanked by crabbe and goyle
	having a last meal, potter when are you getting the train back to the muggles you're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you, said harry coolly
	there was of course nothing at all little about crabbe and goyle, but as the high table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl
	i'd take you on anytime on my own, said malfoy
	tonight, if you want
	wands only  no contact
	what's the matter never heard of a wizard's duel before, i suppose of course he has, said ron, wheeling around
	i'm his second, who's yours malfoy looked at crabbe and goyle, sizing them up
	midnight all right we'll meet you in the trophy room that's always unlocked
	when malfoy had gone, ron and harry looked at each other
	what is a wizard's duel said harry
	and what do you mean, you're my second well, a second's there to take over if you die, said ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie
	catching the look on harry's face, he added quickly, but people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards
	the most you and malfoy'll be able to do is send sparks at each other
	neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage
	i bet he expected you to refuse, anyway
	and what if i wave my wand and nothing happens throw it away and punch him on the nose, ron suggested
	it was hermione granger
	can't a person eat in peace in this place said ron
	hermione ignored him and spoke to harry
	i couldn't help overhearing what you and malfoy were saying  bet you could, ron muttered
	and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you'll lose gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be
	it's really very selfish of you
	and it's really none of your business, said harry
	all the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to dean and seamus falling asleep neville wasn't back from the hospital wing
	ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as if he tries to curse you, you'd better dodge it, because i can't remember how to block them
	there was a very good chance they were going to get caught by filch or mrs
	norris, and harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today
	on the other hand, malfoys sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness  this was his big chance to beat malfoy facetoface
	halfpast eleven, ron muttered at last, we'd better go
	they pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the gryffindor common room
	a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows
	they had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, i can't believe you're going to do this, harry
	it was hermione granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown
	you said ron furiously
	go back to bed i almost told your brother, hermione snapped, percy  he's a prefect, he'd put a stop to this
	harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering
	come on, he said to ron
	he pushed open the portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the hole
	hermione wasn't going to give up that easily
	she followed ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose
	don't you care about gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, i don't want slytherin to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the points i got from professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching spells
	all right, but i warned you, you just remember what i said when you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so  but what they were, they didn't find out
	hermione had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting
	the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and hermione was locked out of gryffindor tower
	now what am i going to do she asked shrilly
	that's your problem, said ron
	we've got to go, we 3 re going to be late
	they hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when hermione caught up with them
	i'm coming with you, she said
	d'you think i'm going to stand out here and wait for filch to catch me if he finds all three of us i'll tell him the truth, that i was trying to stop you, and you can back me up
	you've got some nerve  said ron loudly
	shut up, both of you said harry sharply
	it was a sort of snuffling
	norris breathed ron, squinting through the dark
	he was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer
	thank goodness you found me i've been out here for hours, i couldn't remember the new password to get in to bed
	keep your voice down, neville
	the password's 'pig snout' but it won't help you now, the fat lady's gone off somewhere
	how's your arm said harry
	fine, said neville, showing them
	madam pomfrey mended it in about a minute
	good  well, look, neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you later  don't leave me said neville, scrambling to his feet, i don't want to stay here alone, the bloody baron's been past twice already
	ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at hermione and neville
	if either of you get us caught, i'll never rest until i've learned that curse of the bogies quirrell told us about, and used it on you
	hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the bogies, but harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward
	they flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows
	at every turn harry expected to run into filch or mrs
	norris, but they were lucky
	they sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room
	malfoy and crabbe weren't there yet
	the crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them
	cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness
	they edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room
	harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in and started at once
	the minutes crept by
	he's late, maybe he's chickened out, ron whispered
	then a noise in the next room made them jump
	harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasn't malfoy
	sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner
	it was filch speaking to mrs
	horrorstruck, harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurried silently toward the door, away from filch's voice
	neville's robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard filch enter the trophy room
	they're in here somewhere, they heard him mutter, probably hiding
	this way harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor
	they could hear filch getting nearer
	neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor
	the clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle
	run harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether filch was following  they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going  they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room
	i think we've lost him, harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead
	neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering
	i  told you, hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, i  told  you
	we've got to get back to gryffindor tower, said ron, quickly as possible
	malfoy tricked you, hermione said to harry
	you realize that, don't you he was never going to meet you  filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, malfoy must have tipped him off
	harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her that
	it wasn't going to be that simple
	they hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them
	he caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight
	shut up, peeves  please  you'll get us thrown out
	wandering around at midnight, ickle firsties tut, tut, tut
	naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty
	not if you don't give us away, peeves, please
	should tell filch, i should, said peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly
	it's for your own good, you know
	get out of the way, snapped ron, taking a swipe at peeves this was a big mistake
	students out of bed peeves bellowed, students out of bed down the charms corridor ducking under peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door  and it was locked
	this is it ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, we're done for this is the end they could hear footsteps, filch running as fast as he could toward peeves's shouts
	oh, move over, hermione snarled
	she grabbed harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, 'alohomora the lock clicked and the door swung open  they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening
	which way did they go, peeves filch was saying
	' don't mess with me, peeves, now where did they go shan't say nothing if you don't say please, said peeves in his annoying singsong voice
	nothing ha haaa told you i wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please ha ha haaaaaa and they heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and filch cursing in rage
	he thinks this door is locked, harry whispered
	i think we'll be okay  get off, neville for neville had been tugging on the sleeve of harry's bathrobe for the last minute
	what harry turned around  and saw, quite clearly, what
	for a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare  this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far
	they weren't in a room, as he had supposed
	they were in a corridor
	the forbidden corridor on the third floor
	and now they knew why it was forbidden
	they were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor
	three pairs of rolling, mad eyes three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs
	it was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant
	harry groped for the doorknob  between filch and death, he'd take filch
	they fell backward  harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor
	filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared  all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster
	they didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor
	where on earth have you all been she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces
	never mind that  pig snout, pig snout, panted harry, and the portrait swung forward
	they scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs
	it was a while before any of them said anything
	neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again
	what do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school said ron finally
	if any dog needs exercise, that one does
	hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again
	you don't use your eyes, any of you, do you she snapped
	didn't you see what it was standing on
	the floor harry suggested
	i wasn't looking at its feet, i was too busy with its heads
	it was standing on a trapdoor
	it's obviously guarding something
	she stood up, glaring at them
	i hope you're pleased with yourselves
	we could all have been killed  or worse, expelled
	now, if you don't mind, i'm going to bed
	ron stared after her, his mouth open
	no, we don't mind, he said
	you'd think we dragged her along, wouldn't you
	but hermione had given harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed
	the dog was guarding something
	what had hagrid said gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide  except perhaps hogwarts
	it looked as though harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was
	chapter ten halloween malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful
	indeed, by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the threeheaded dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one
	in the meantime, harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection
	it's either really valuable or really dangerous, said ron
	but as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues
	neither neville nor hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor
	all neville cared about was never going near the dog again
	hermione was now refusing to speak to harry and ron, but she was such a bossy knowitall that they saw this as an added bonus
	all they really wanted now was a way of getting back at malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later
	as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls
	harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor
	they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel
	harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said do not open the parcel at the table
	it contains your new nimbus two thousand, but i don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one
	oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session
	professor mcgonagall harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to ron to read
	a nimbus two thousand ron moaned enviously
	i've never even touched one
	they left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle
	malfoy seized the package from harry and felt it
	that's a broomstick, he said, throwing it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face
	you'll be in for it this time, potter, first years aren't allowed them
	ron couldn't resist it
	it's not any old broomstick, he said, it's a nimbus two thousand
	what did you say you've got at home, malfoy, a comet two sixty ron grinned at harry
	comets look flashy, but they're not in the same league as the nimbus
	what would you know about it, weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle, malfoy snapped back
	i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig
	before ron could answer, professor flitwick appeared at malfoy's elbow
	not arguing, i hope, boys he squeaked
	potter's been sent a broomstick, professor, said malfoy quickly
	yes, yes, that's right, said professor flitwick, beaming at harry
	professor mcgonagall told me all about the special circumstances, potter
	and what model is it a nimbus two thousand, sit, said harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoy's face
	and it's really thanks to malfoy here that i've got it, he added
	harry and ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at malfoy's obvious rage and confusion
	well, it's true, harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, if he hadn't stolen neville's remembrall i wouln't be on the team
	so i suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules came an angry voice from just behind them
	hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in harry's hand
	i thought you weren't speaking to us said harry
	yes, don't stop now, said ron, it's doing us so much good
	hermione marched away with her nose in the air
	harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day
	it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night
	he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last
	wow, ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto harry's bedspread
	even harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful
	sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the top
	as seven o'clock drew nearer, harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field
	held never been inside the stadium before
	hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on
	at either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end
	they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high
	too eager to fly again to wait for wood, harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground
	what a feeling  he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field
	the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch
	hey, potter, come down' oliver wood had arrived
	fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm
	harry landed next to him
	very nice, said wood, his eyes glinting
	i see what mcgonagall meant
	you really are a natural
	i'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week
	inside were four differentsized balls
	now, quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play
	there are seven players on each side
	three of them are called chasers
	three chasers, harry repeated, as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball
	this ball's called the quaffle, said wood
	the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal
	ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops
	follow me the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to score, harry recited
	so  that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn't it what's basketball said wood curiously
	never mind, said harry quickly
	now, there's another player on each side who's called the keeper i'm keeper for gryffindor
	i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring
	three chasers, one keeper, said harry, who was determined to remember it all
	and they play with the quaffle
	so what are they for he pointed at the three balls left inside the box
	i'll show you now, said wood
	he handed harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat
	i'm going to show you what the bludgers do, wood said
	these two are the bludgers
	he showed harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle
	harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box
	stand back, wood warned harry
	he bent down and freed one of the bludgers
	at once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harry's face
	harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air  it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground
	see wood panted, forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely
	the bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms
	that's why you have two beaters on each team  the weasley twins are ours  it's their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team
	so  think you've got all that three chasers try and score with the quaffle the keeper guards the goal posts the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team, harry reeled off
	very good, said wood
	er  have the bludgers ever killed anyone harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand
	we've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that
	now, the last member of the team is the seeker
	and you don't have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open
	don't worry, the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers  i mean, they're like a pair of human bludgers themselves
	wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball
	compared with the quaffle and the bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut
	it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings
	this, said wood, is the golden snitch, and it's the most important ball of the lot
	it's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see
	it's the seeker's job to catch it
	you've got to weave in and out of the chasers, beaters, bludgers, and quaffle to get it before the other team's seeker, because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win
	that's why seekers get fouled so much
	a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages  i think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep
	well, that's it  any questions harry shook his head
	he understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem
	we won't practice with the snitch yet, said wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, it's too dark, we might lose it
	let's try you out with a few of these
	he pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and harry were up in the air, wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for harry to catch
	harry didn't miss a single one, and wood was delighted
	after half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on
	that quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year, said wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle
	i wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley, and he could have played for england if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons
	perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at hogwarts two months
	the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had
	his lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics
	on halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors
	even better, professor flitwick announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make neville's toad zoom around the classroom
	professor flitwick put the class into pairs to practice
	harry's partner was seamus finnigan which was a relief, because neville had been trying to catch his eye
	ron, however, was to be working with hermione granger
	it was hard to tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this
	she hadn't spoken to either of them since the day harry's broomstick had arrived
	now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing squeaked professor flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual
	swish and flick, remember, swish and flick
	and saying the magic words properly is very important, too  never forget wizard baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest
	it was very difficult
	harry and seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop
	seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it  harry had to put it out with his hat
	ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck
	wingardium leviosa he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill
	you're saying it wrong, harry heard hermione snap
	it's winggardium leviosa, make the 'gar' nice and long
	you do it, then, if you're so clever, ron snarled
	hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, wingardium leviosa their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads
	oh, well done cried professor flitwick, clapping
	everyone see here, miss granger's done it ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class
	it's no wonder no one can stand her, he said to harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, she's a nightmare, honestly
	someone knocked into harry as they hurried past him
	harry caught a glimpse of her face  and was startled to see that she was in tears
	i think she heard you
	so said ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable
	she must've noticed she's got no friends
	hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon
	on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast, harry and ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone
	ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the great hall, where the halloween decorations put hermione out of their minds
	a thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter
	the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the startofterm banquet
	harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face
	everyone stared as he reached professor dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, troll  in the dungeons  thought you ought to know
	he then sank to the floor in a dead faint
	it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor dumbledore's wand to bring silence
	prefects, he rumbled, lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately percy was in his element
	follow me stick together, first years no need to fear the troll if you follow my orders stay close behind me, now
	make way, first years coming through excuse me, i'm a prefect how could a troll get in harry asked as they climbed the stairs
	don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid, said ron
	maybe peeves let it in for a halloween joke
	they passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions
	as they jostled their way through a crowd of confused hufflepuffs, harry suddenly grabbed ron's arm
	i've just thought  hermione
	what about her she doesn't know about the troll
	oh, all right, he snapped
	but percy'd better not see us
	ducking down, they joined the hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom
	they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them
	percy hissed ron, pulling harry behind a large stone griffin
	peering around it, however, they saw not percy but snape
	he crossed the corridor and disappeared from view
	what's he doing harry whispered
	why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers search me
	quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after snape's fading footsteps
	he's heading for the third floor, harry said, but ron held up his hand
	can you smell something harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean
	and then they heard it  a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet
	ron pointed  at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them
	they shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight
	it was a horrible sight
	twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut
	it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet
	the smell coming from it was incredible
	it was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long
	the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside
	it waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room
	the keys in the lock, harry muttered
	good idea, said ron nervously
	they edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it
	with one great leap, harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it
	'yes flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop  a high, petrified scream  and it was coming from the chamber they'd just chained up
	oh, no, said ron, pale as the bloody baron
	it's the girls' bathroom harry gasped
	hermione they said together
	it was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic
	harry pulled the door open and they ran inside
	hermione granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint
	the troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went
	confuse it harry said desperately to ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall
	the troll stopped a few feet from hermione
	it lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise
	its mean little eyes saw harry
	it hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went
	oy, peabrain yelled ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it
	the troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward ron instead, giving harry time to run around it
	come on, run, run harry yelled at hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror
	the shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk
	it roared again and started toward ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape
	harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind
	the troll couldn't feel harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped  it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils
	howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with harry clinging on for dear life any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club
	hermione had sunk to the floor in fright ron pulled out his own wand  not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head wingardium leviosa the club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over  and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head
	the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble
	harry got to his feet
	he was shaking and out of breath
	ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done
	it was hermione who spoke first
	is it  dead i don't think so, said harry, i think it's just been knocked out
	he bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose
	it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue
	he wiped it on the troll's trousers
	a sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up
	they hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars
	a moment later, professor mcgonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by snape, with quirrell bringing up the rear
	quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart
	snape bent over the troll
	professor mcgonagall was looking at ron and harry
	harry had never seen her look so angry
	hopes of winning fifty points for gryffindor faded quickly from harry's mind
	what on earth were you thinking of said professor mcgonagall, with cold fury in her voice
	harry looked at ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air
	you're lucky you weren't killed
	why aren't you in your dormitory snape gave harry a swift, piercing look
	harry looked at the floor
	he wished ron would put his wand down
	then a small voice came out of the shadows
	please, professor mcgonagall  they were looking for me
	miss granger hermione had managed to get to her feet at last
	i went looking for the troll because i  i thought i could deal with it on my own  you know, because i've read all about them
	ron dropped his wand
	hermione granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher if they hadn't found me, i'd be dead now
	harry stuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out with its own club
	they didn't have time to come and fetch anyone
	it was about to finish me off when they arrived
	harry and ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them
	said professor mcgonagall, staring at the three of them, miss granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own hermione hung her head
	harry was speechless
	hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble
	it was as if snape had started handing out sweets
	miss granger, five points will be taken from gryffindor for this, said professor mcgonagall
	i'm very disappointed in you
	if you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to gryffindor tower
	students are finishing the feast in their houses
	professor mcgonagall turned to harry and ron
	well, i still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a fullgrown mountain troll
	you each win gryffindor five points
	professor dumbledore will be informed of this
	they hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up
	it was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else
	we should have gotten more than ten points, ron grumbled
	five, you mean, once she's taken off hermione's
	good of her to get us out of trouble like that, ron admitted
	mind you, we did save her
	she might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her, harry reminded him
	they had reached the portrait of the fat lady
	pig snout, they said and entered
	the common room was packed and noisy
	everyone was eating the food that had been sent up
	hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them
	there was a very embarrassed pause
	then, none of them looking at each other, they all said thanks, and hurried off to get plates
	but from that moment on, hermione granger became their friend
	there are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of them
	chapter eleven quidditch as they entered november, the weather turned very cold
	the mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel
	every morning the ground was covered in frost
	hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots
	the quidditch season had begun
	on saturday, harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training gryffindor versus slytherin
	if gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship
	hardly anyone had seen harry play because wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, harry should be kept, well, secret
	but the news that he was playing seeker had leaked out somehow, and harry didn't know which was worse  people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress
	it was really lucky that harry now had hermlone as a friend
	he didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the lastminute quidditch practice wood was making them do
	she had also tent him quidditch through the ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read
	harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in 1473 that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara desert
	hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it
	the day before harry's first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar
	they were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when snape crossed the yard
	harry noticed at once that snape was limping
	harry, ron, and hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it wouldn't be allowed
	unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught snape's eye
	he hadn't seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway
	what's that you've got there, potter it was quidditch through the ages
	library books are not to be taken outside the school, said snape
	five points from gryffindor
	he's just made that rule up, harry muttered angrily as snape limped away
	wonder what's wrong with his leg dunno, but i hope it's really hurting him, said ron bitterly
	the gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening
	harry, ron, and hermione sat together next to a window
	hermione was checking harry and ron's charms homework for them
	she would never let them copy how will you learn, but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway
	he wanted quidditch through the ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow
	why should he be afraid of snape getting up, he told ron and hermione he was going to ask snape if he could have it
	better you than me, they said together, but harry had an idea that snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening
	he made his way down to the staffroom and knocked
	perhaps snape had left the book in there it was worth a try
	he pushed the door ajar and peered inside  and a horrible scene met his eyes
	snape and filch were inside, alone
	snape was holding his robes above his knees
	one of his legs was bloody and mangled
	filch was handing snape bandages
	blasted thing, snape was saying
	how are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once harry tried to shut the door quietly, but  potter snape's face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg
	i just wondered if i could have my book back
	get out out harry left, before snape could take any more points from gryffindor
	he sprinted back upstairs
	did you get it ron asked as harry joined them
	what's the matter in a low whisper, harry told them what he'd seen
	you know what this means he finished breathlessly
	he tried to get past that threeheaded dog at halloween that's where he was going when we saw him  he's after whatever it's guarding and id bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion hermione's eyes were wide
	no  he wouldn't, she said
	i know he's not very nice, but he wouldn't try and steal something dumbledore was keeping safe
	honestly, hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something, snapped ron
	i wouldn't put anything past snape
	but what's he after what's that dog guarding harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question
	neville was snoring loudly, but harry couldn't sleep
	he tried to empty his mind  he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first quidditch match in a few hours  but the expression on snape's face when harry had seen his leg wasn't easy to forget
	the next morning dawned very bright and cold
	the great hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good quidditch match
	you've got to eat some breakfast
	i don't want anything
	just a bit of toast, wheedled hermione
	in an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field
	harry, you need your strength, said seamus finnigan
	seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team
	thanks, seamus, said harry, watching seamus pile ketchup on his sausages
	by eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the quidditch pitch
	many students had binoculars
	the seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes
	ron and hermione joined neville, seamus, and dean the west ham fan up in the top row
	as a surprise for harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets scabbers had ruined
	it said potter for president, and dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large gryffindor lion underneath
	then hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors
	meanwhile, in the locker room, harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes slytherin would be playing in green
	wood cleared his throat for silence
	and women, said chaser angelina johnson
	and women, wood agreed
	the big one, said fred weasley
	the one we've all been waiting for, said george
	we know oliver's speech by heart, fred told harry, we were on the team last year
	shut up, you two, said wood
	this is the best team gryffindor's had in years
	he glared at them all as if to say, or else
	good luck, all of you
	harry followed fred and george out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers
	madam hooch was refereeing
	she stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand
	now, i want a nice fair game, all of you, she said, once they were all gathered around her
	harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the slytherin captain, marcus flint, a sixth year
	harry thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him
	out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing potter for president over the crowd
	mount your brooms, please
	harry clambered onto his nimbus two thousand
	madam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle
	fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air
	and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson of gryffindor  what an excellent chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too  jordan sorry, professor
	the weasley twins' friend, lee jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by professor mcgonagall
	and she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to alicia spinnet, a good find of oliver wood's, last year only a reserve  back to johnson and  no, the slytherins have taken the quaffle, slytherin captain marcus flint gains the quaffle and off he goes  flint flying like an eagle up there  he's going to sc no, stopped by an excellent move by gryffindor keeper wood and the gryffindors take the quaffle  that's chaser katie bell of gryffindor there, nice dive around flint, off up the field and  ouch  that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a bludger  quaffle taken by the slytherins  that's adrian pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a second bludger  sent his way by fred or george weasley, can't tell which  nice play by the gryffindor beater, anyway, and johnson back in possession of the quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes  she's really flying  dodges a speeding bludger  the goal posts are ahead  come on, now, angelina  keeper bletchley dives  misses  gryffindors score gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the slytherins
	budge up there, move along
	hagrid ron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid enough space to join them
	bin watchin' from me hut, said hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, but it isn't the same as bein' in the crowd
	no sign of the snitch yet, eh nope, said ron
	harry hasn't had much to do yet
	kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin', said hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was harry
	way up above them, harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the snitch
	this was part of his and wood's game plan
	keep out of the way until you catch sight of the snitch, wood had said
	we don't want you attacked before you have to be
	when angelina had scored, harry had done a couple of looptheloops to let off his feelings
	now he was back to staring around for the snitch
	once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the weasleys' wristwatches, and once a bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but harry dodged it and fred weasley came chasing after it
	all right there, harry he had time to yell, as he beat the bludger furiously toward marcus flint
	slytherin in possession, lee jordan was saying, chaser pucey ducks two bludgers, two weasleys, and chaser bell, and speeds toward the  wait a moment  was that the snitch a murmur ran through the crowd as adrian pucey dropped the quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear
	in a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold
	slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen it, too
	neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch all the chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch
	harry was faster than higgs  he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead   he put on an extra spurt of speed  wham a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors below  marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose, and harry's broom spun off course, harry holding on for dear life
	foul screamed the gryffindors
	madam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for gryffindor
	but in all the confusion, of course, the golden snitch had disappeared from sight again
	down in the stands, dean thomas was yelling, send him off, ref red card what are you talking about, dean said ron
	red card said dean furiously
	in soccer you get shown the red card and you're out of the game but this isn't soccer, dean, ron reminded him
	hagrid, however, was on dean's side
	they oughta change the rules
	flint coulda knocked harry outta the air
	lee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides
	so  after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating jordan growled professor mcgonagall
	i mean, after that open and revolting foul 'jordan, i'm warning you  all right, all right
	flint nearly kills the gryffindor seeker, which could happen to anyone, i'm sure, so a penalty to gryffindor, taken by spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, gryffindor still in possession
	it was as harry dodged another bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened
	his broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch
	for a split second, he thought he was going to fall
	he gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees
	he'd never felt anything like that
	it was as though the broom was trying to buck him off
	but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off
	harry tried to turn back toward the gryffindor goal posts  he had half a mind to ask wood to call timeout  and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control
	he couldn't direct it at all
	it was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him
	lee was still commentating
	slytherin in possession  flint with the quaffle  passes spinnet  passes bell  hit hard in the face by a bludger, hope it broke his nose  only joking, professor  slytherins score  a no
	the slytherins were cheering
	no one seemed to have noticed that harry's broom was behaving strangely
	it was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went
	dunno what harry thinks he's doing, hagrid mumbled
	he stared through his binoculars
	if i didn' know better, i'd say he'd lost control of his broom
	suddenly, people were pointing up at harry all over the stands
	his broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on
	then the whole crowd gasped
	harry's broom had given a wild jerk and harry swung off it
	he was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand
	did something happen to it when flint blocked him seamus whispered
	can't have, hagrid said, his voice shaking
	can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic  no kid could do that to a nimbus two thousand
	at these words, hermione seized hagrid's binoculars, but instead of looking up at harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd
	what are you doing moaned ron, grayfaced
	i knew it, hermione gasped, snape  look
	ron grabbed the binoculars
	snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them
	he had his eyes fixed on harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath
	he's doing something  jinxing the broom, said hermione
	what should we do leave it to me
	before ron could say another word, hermione had disappeared
	ron turned the binoculars back on harry
	his broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer
	the whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the weasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good  every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still
	they dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell
	marcus flint seized the quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing
	come on, hermione, ron muttered desperately
	hermione had fought her way across to the stand where snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him she didn't even stop to say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in front
	reaching snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well chosen words
	bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of snape's robes
	it took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize that he was on fire
	a sudden yelp told her she had done her job
	scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row  snape would never know what had happened
	up in the air, harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom
	neville, you can look ron said
	neville had been sobbing into hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes
	harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick  he hit the field on all fours  coughed  and something gold fell into his hand
	i've got the snitch he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion
	he didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it, flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference  harry hadn't broken any rules and lee jordan was still happily shouting the results  gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty
	harry heard none of this, though
	he was being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrid's hut, with ron and hermione
	it was snape, ron was explaining, hermione and i saw him
	he was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you
	rubbish, said hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands
	why would snape do somethin' like that harry, ron, and hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him
	harry decided on the truth
	i found out something about him, he told hagrid
	he tried to get past that threeheaded dog on halloween
	we think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding
	hagrid dropped the teapot
	how do you know about fluffy he said
	fluffy yeah  he's mine  bought him off a greek chappie i met in the pub las' year  i lent him to dumbledore to guard the yes said harry eagerly
	now, don't ask me anymore, said hagrid gruffly
	that's top secret, that is
	but snape's trying to steal it
	rubbish, said hagrid again
	snape's a hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' of the sort
	so why did he just try and kill harry cried hermione
	the afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about snape
	i know a jinx when i see one, hagrid, i've read all about them you've got to keep eye contact, and snape wasn't blinking at all, i saw him i'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong said hagrid hotly
	i don' know why harry's broom acted like that, but snape wouldn' try an' kill a student now, listen to me, all three of yeh  yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh
	you forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between professor dumbledore an' nicolas flamel  aha said harry, so there's someone called nicolas flamel involved, is there hagrid looked furious with himself
	chapter twelve the mirror of erised christmas was coming
	one morning in middecember, hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow
	the lake froze solid and the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban
	the few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by hagrid before they could fly off again
	no one could wait for the holidays to start
	while the gryffindor common room and the great hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms
	worst of all were professor snape's classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons
	i do feel so sorry, said draco malfoy, one potions class, for all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because they're not wanted at home
	he was looking over at harry as he spoke
	crabbe and goyle chuckled
	harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them
	malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch match
	disgusted that the slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a widemouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as seeker next
	then he'd realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick
	so malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting harry about having no proper family
	it was true that harry wasn't going back to privet drive for christmas
	professor mcgonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and harry had signed up at once
	he didn't feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be the best christmas he'd ever had
	ron and his brothers were staying, too, because mr
	weasley were going to romania to visit charlie
	when they left the dungeons at the end of potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead
	two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind it
	hi, hagrid, want any help ron asked, sticking his head through the branches
	nah, i'm all right, thanks, ron
	would you mind moving out of the way came malfoys cold drawl from behind them
	are you trying to earn some extra money, weasley hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts, i suppose  that hut of hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to
	ron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the stairs
	weasley ron let go of the front of malfoy's robes
	he was provoked, professor snape, said hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree
	malfoy was insultin' his family
	be that as it may, fighting is against hogwarts rules, hagrid, said snape silkily
	five points from gryffindor, weasley, and be grateful it isn't more
	move along, all of you
	malfoy, crabbe, and goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking
	i'll get him, said ron, grinding his teeth at malfoy's back, one of these days, i'll get him  i hate them both, said harry, malfoy and snape
	come on, cheer up, it's nearly christmas, said hagrid
	tell yeh what, come with me an' see the great hall, looks a treat
	so the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off to the great hall, where professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick were busy with the christmas decorations
	ah, hagrid, the last tree  put it in the far corner, would you the hall looked spectacular
	festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles
	how many days you got left until yer holidays hagrid asked
	just one, said hermione
	and that reminds me harry, ron, we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library
	oh yeah, you're right, said ron, tearing his eyes away from professor flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree
	the library said hagrid, following them out of the hall
	just before the holidays bit keen, aren't yeh oh, we're not working, harry told him brightly
	ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel we've been trying to find out who he is
	you what hagrid looked shocked
	listen here  i've told yeh  drop it
	it's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'
	we just want to know who nicolas flamel is, that's all, said hermione
	unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble harry added
	we must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere  just give us a hint  i know i've read his name somewhere
	i'm sayin' nothin, said hagrid flatly
	just have to find out for ourselves, then, said ron, and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library
	they had indeed been searching books for flamel's name ever since hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to steal the trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a book
	he wasn't in great wizards of the twentieth century, or notable magical names of our time he was missing, too, from important modern magical discoveries, and a study of recent developments in wizardry
	and then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library tens of thousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rows
	hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random
	harry wandered over to the restricted section
	he had been wondering for a while if flamel wasn't somewhere in there
	unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one
	these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark arts
	what are you looking for, boy nothing, said harry
	madam pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him
	you'd better get out, then
	go on  out wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, harry left the library
	he, ron, and hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel
	they were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk snape hearing what they were up to
	harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful
	they had been looking for two weeks, after a, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing
	what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks
	five minutes later, ron and hermione joined him, shaking their heads
	they went off to lunch
	you will keep looking while i'm away, won't you said hermione
	and send me an owl if you find anything
	and you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is, said ron
	it'd be safe to ask them
	very safe, as they're both dentists, said hermione
	once the holidays had started, ron and harry were having too good a time to think much about flamel
	they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire
	they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork  bread, english muffins, marshmallows  and plotting ways of getting malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work
	ron also started teaching harry wizard chess
	this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle
	ron's set was very old and battered
	like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family  in this case, his grandfather
	however, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all
	ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted
	harry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him, and they didn't trust him at all
	he wasn't a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing
	don't send me there, can't you see his knight send him, we can afford to lose him
	on christmas eve, harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all
	when he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed
	merry christmas, said ron sleepily as harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe
	you, too, said harry
	will you look at this i've got some presents what did you expect, turnips said ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than harry's
	harry picked up the top parcel
	it was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to harry, from hagrid
	inside was a roughly cut wooden flute
	hagrid had obviously whittled it himself
	harry blew it  it sounded a bit like an owl
	a second, very small parcel contained a note
	we received your message and enclose your christmas present
	from uncle vernon and aunt petunia
	taped to the note was a fiftypence piece
	that's friendly, said harry
	ron was fascinated by the fifty pence
	weird he said, 'nmat a shape this is money you can keep it, said harry, laughing at how pleased ron was
	hagrid and my aunt and uncle  so who sent these i think i know who that one's from, said ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel
	i told her you didn't expect any presents and  oh, no, he groaned, she's made you a weasley sweater
	harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, handknitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge
	every year she makes us a sweater, said ron, unwrapping his own, and mine's always maroon
	that's really nice of her, said harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty
	his next present also contained candy  a large box of chocolate frogs from hermione
	this only left one parcel
	harry picked it up and felt it
	something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds
	i've heard of those, he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of every flavor beans he'd gotten from hermione
	if that's what i think it is  they're really rare, and really valuable
	what is it harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor
	it was strange to the touch, like water woven into material
	it's an invisibility cloak, said ron, a look of awe on his face
	i'm sure it is  try it on
	harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron gave a yell
	it is look down harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone
	he dashed to the mirror
	sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible
	he pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely
	there's a note said ron suddenly
	a note fell out of it harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter
	written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words your father left this in my possession before he died
	it is time it was returned to you
	a very merry christmas to you
	there was no signature
	harry stared at the note
	ron was admiring the cloak
	i'd give anything for one of these, he said
	what's the matter nothing, said harry
	he felt very strange
	who had sent the cloak had it really once belonged to his father before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and fred and george weasley bounded in
	harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight
	he didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else yet
	merry christmas hey, look  harry's got a weasley sweater, too fred and george were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow f on it, the other a g
	harry's is better than ours, though, said fred, holding up harry's sweater
	she obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family
	why aren't you wearing yours, ron george demanded
	come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm
	i hate maroon, ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head
	you haven't got a letter on yours, george observed
	i suppose she thinks you don't forget your name
	but we're not stupid  we know we're called gred and forge
	what's all th is noise
	percy weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving
	he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which fred seized
	p for prefect get it on, percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even harry got one
	i  don't  want said percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew
	and you're not sitting with the prefects today, either, said george
	christmas is a time for family
	they frogmarched percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater
	harry had never in all his life had such a christmas dinner
	a hundred fat, roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of chipolatas tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce  and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table
	these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside
	harry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice
	up at the high table, dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor flitwick had just read him
	flaming christmas puddings followed the turkey
	percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice
	harry watched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the cheek, who, to harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided
	when harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a growyourownwarts kit, and his own new wizard chess set
	the white mice had disappeared and harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs
	norris's christmas dinner
	harry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds
	then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the gryffindor common room, where harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron
	he suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if percy hadn't tried to help him so much
	after a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge
	it had been harry's best christmas day ever
	yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day
	not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it
	ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his fourposter
	harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it
	this had been his father's
	he let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air
	use it well, the note had said
	he had to try it, now
	he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself
	looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows
	it was a very funny feeling
	suddenly, harry felt wideawake
	the whole of hogwarts was open to him in this cloak
	excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence
	he could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and filch would never know
	ron grunted in his sleep
	should harry wake him something held him back  his father's cloak  he felt that this time  the first time  he wanted to use it alone
	he crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole
	who's there squawked the fat lady
	he walked quickly down the corridor
	where should he go he stopped, his heart racing, and thought
	and then it came to him
	the restricted section in the library
	he'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who flamel was
	he set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked
	the library was pitchblack and very eerie
	harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books
	the lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps
	the restricted section was right at the back of the library
	step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles
	they didn't tell him much
	their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages harry couldn't understand
	some had no title at all
	one book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood
	the hairs on the back of harry's neck prickled
	maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be
	he had to start somewhere
	setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book
	a large black and silver volume caught his eye
	he pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open
	a piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence  the book was screaming harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note
	he stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once
	panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside  stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it
	he passed filch in the doorway filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and harry slipped under filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears
	he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor
	he had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going
	perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all
	there was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there
	you asked me to come directly to you, professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library restricted section
	harry felt the blood drain out of his face
	wherever he was, filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was snape who replied, the restricted section well, they can't be far, we'll catch them
	harry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape came around the corner ahead
	they couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him  the cloak didn't stop him from being solid
	he backed away as quietly as he could
	a door stood ajar to his left
	it was his only hope
	he squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything
	they walked straight past, and harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away
	that had been close, very close
	it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in
	it looked like an unused classroom
	the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket  but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way
	it was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet
	there was an inscription carved around the top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi
	his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch and snape, harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again
	he stepped in front of it
	he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming
	his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed  for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him
	but the room was empty
	breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror
	there he was, reflected in it, white and scaredlooking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others
	harry looked over his shoulder  but still, no one was there
	or were they all invisible, too was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not he looked in the mirror again
	a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving
	he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him
	if she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air  she and the others existed only in the mirror
	she was a very pretty woman
	she had dark red hair and her eyes  her eyes are just like mine, harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass
	bright green  exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying smiling, but crying at the same time
	the tall, thin, blackhaired man standing next to her put his arm around her
	he wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy
	it stuck up at the back, just as harry's did
	harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection
	dad they just looked at him, smiling
	and slowly, harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had harry's knobbly knees  harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life
	the potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them
	he had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness
	how long he stood there, he didn't know
	the reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses
	he couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed
	he tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, i'll come back, and hurried from the room
	you could have woken me up, said ron, crossly
	you can come tonight, i'm going back, i want to show you the mirror
	i'd like to see your mom and dad, ron said eagerly
	and i want to see all your family, all the weasleys, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone
	you can see them any old time, said ron
	just come round my house this summer
	anyway, maybe it only shows dead people
	shame about not finding flamel, though
	have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything harry couldn't eat
	he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight
	he had almost forgotten about flamel
	it didn't seem very important anymore
	who cared what the three headed dog was guarding what did it matter if snape stole it, really are you all right said ron
	what harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again
	with ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night
	they tried retracing harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour
	i'm freezing, said ron
	let's forget it and go back
	i know it's here somewhere
	they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else
	just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, harry spotted the suit of armor
	it's here  just here  yes they pushed the door open
	harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror
	his mother and father beamed at the sight of him
	i can't see anything
	look look at them all
	there are loads of them
	look in it properly, go on, stand where i am
	harry stepped aside, but with ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just ron in his paisley pajamas
	ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image
	can you see all your family standing around you no  i'm alone  but i'm different  i look older  and i'm head boy what i am  i'm wearing the badge like bill used to  and i'm holding the house cup and the quidditch cup  i'm quidditch captain, too
	ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at harry
	do you think this mirror shows the future how can it all my family are dead  let me have another look  you had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time
	you're only holding the quidditch cup, what's interesting about that i want to see my parents
	don't push me  a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion
	they hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking
	quick ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of mrs
	norris came round the door
	ron and harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing  did the cloak work on cats after what seemed an age, she turned and left
	this isn't safe  she might have gone for filch, i bet she heard us
	and ron pulled harry out of the room
	the snow still hadn't melted the next morning
	want to play chess, harry said ron
	why don't we go down and visit hagrid no
	i know what you're thinking about, harry, that mirror
	don't go back tonight
	why not i dunno, i've just got a bad feeling about it  and anyway, you've had too many close shaves already
	filch, snape, and mrs
	norris are wandering around
	so what if they can't see you what if they walk into you what if you knock something over you sound like hermione
	i'm serious, harry, don't go
	but harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and ron wasn't going to stop him
	that third night he found his way more quickly than before
	he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone
	and there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily
	harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror
	there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family
	except  so  back again, harry harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice
	he looked behind him
	sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than albus dumbledore
	harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him
	i didn't see you, sir
	strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you, said dumbledore, and harry was relieved to see that he was smiling
	so, said dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with harry, you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised
	i didn't know it was called that, sir
	but i expect you've realized by now what it does it  well  it shows me my family  and it showed your friend ron himself as head boy
	how did you know  i don't need a cloak to become invisible, said dumbledore gently
	now, can you think what the mirror of erised shows us all harry shook his head
	the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is
	does that help harry thought
	then he said slowly, it shows us what we want
	yes and no, said dumbledore quietly
	it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts
	you, who have never known your family, see them standing around you
	ronald weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them
	however, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth
	men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible
	the mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, harry, and i ask you not to go looking for it again
	if you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared
	it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that
	now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed harry stood up
	sir  professor dumbledore can i ask you something obviously, you've just done so, dumbledore smiled
	you may ask me one more thing, however
	what do you see when you look in the mirror i i see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks
	one can never have enough socks, said dumbledore
	another christmas has come and gone and i didn't get a single pair
	people will insist on giving me books
	it was only when he was back in bed that it struck harry that dumbledore might not have been quite truthful
	but then, he thought, as he shoved scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question
	chapter thirteen nicolas flamel dumbledore had convinced harry not to go looking for the mirror of erised again, and for the rest of the christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk
	harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't
	he started having nightmares
	over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter
	you see, dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad, said ron, when harry told him about these drearns
	hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things
	she was torn between horror at the idea of harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row if filch had caught you, and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who nicolas flamel was
	they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a li brary book, even though harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere
	once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks
	harry had even less time than the other two, because quidditch practice had started again
	wood was working the team harder than ever
	even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits
	the weasleys complained that wood was becoming a fanatic, but harry was on wood's side
	if they won their next match, against hufflepuff, they would overtake slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years
	quite apart from wanting to win, harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training
	then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, wood gave the team a bit of bad news
	he'd just gotten very angry with the weasleys, who kept divebombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms
	will you stop messing around he yelled
	that's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off gryffindor george weasley really did fall off his broom at these words
	snape's refereeing he spluttered through a mouthful of mud
	when's he ever refereed a quidditch match he's not going to be fair if we might overtake slytherin
	the rest of the team landed next to george to complain, too
	it's not my fault, said wood
	we've just got to make sure we play a clean game, so snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us
	which was all very well, thought harry, but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing quidditch
	the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but harry headed straight back to the gryffindor common room, where he found ron and hermione playing chess
	chess was the only thing hermione ever lost at, something harry and ron thought was very good for her
	don't talk to me for a moment, said ron when harry sat down next to him, i need to concen  he caught sight of harry's face
	what's the matter with you you look terrible
	speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, harry told the other two about snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a quidditch referee
	don't play, said hermione at once
	say you're ill, said ron
	pretend to break your leg, hermione suggested
	really break your leg, said ron
	there isn't a reserve seeker
	if i back out, gryffindor can't play at all
	at that moment neville toppled into the common room
	how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leglocker curse
	he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower
	everyone fell over laughing except hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse
	neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling
	what happened hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with harry and ron
	malfoy, said neville shakily
	i met him outside the library
	he said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on
	go to professor mcgonagall hermione urged neville
	report him neville shook his head
	i don't want more trouble, he mumbled
	you've got to stand up to him, neville said ron
	he's used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier
	there's no need to tell me i'm not brave enough to be in gryffindor, malfoy's already done that, neville choked out
	harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a chocolate frog, the very last one from the box hermione had given him for christmas
	he gave it to neville, who looked as though he might cry
	you're worth twelve of malfoy, harry said
	the sorting hat chose you for gryffindor, didn't it and where's malfoy in stinking slytherin
	neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog
	i think i'll go to bed
	d'you want the card, you collect them, don't you as neville walked away, harry looked at the famous wizard card
	dumbledore again, he said, he was the first one i ever he gasped
	he stared at the back of the card
	then he looked up at ron and hermione
	i've found him he whispered
	i've found flamel i told you i'd read the name somewhere before, i read it on the train coming here  listen to this 'dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, nicolas flamel' hermione jumped to her feet
	she hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework
	stay there she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls' dormitories
	harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms
	i never thought to look in here she whispered excitedly
	i got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading
	light said ron, but hermione told him to be quiet until she'd looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself
	at last she found what she was looking for
	i knew it i knew it are we allowed to speak yet said ron grumpily
	hermione ignored him
	nicolas flamel, she whispered dramatically, is the only known maker of the sorcerer's stone this didn't have quite the effect she'd expected
	the what said harry and ron
	oh, honestly, don't you two read look  read that, there
	she pushed the book toward them, and harry and ron read the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerer's stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers
	the stone will transform any metal into pure gold
	it also produces the elixir of life, which will make the drinker immortal
	there have been many reports of the sorcerer's stone over the centuries, but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr
	nicolas flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover
	flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife, perenelle six hundred and fiftyeight
	see said hermione, when harry and ron had finished
	the dog must be guarding flamel's sorcerer's stone i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the stone moved out of gringotts a stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying said harry
	no wonder snape's after it anyone would want it
	and no wonder we couldn't find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry, said ron
	he's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixtyfive, is he the next morning in defense against the dark arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, harry and ron were still discussing what they'd do with a sorcerer's stone if they had one
	it wasn't until ron said he'd buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape and the coming match
	i'm going to play, he told ron and hermione
	if i don't, all the slytherins will think i'm just too scared to face snape
	it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win
	just as long as we're not wiping you off the field, said hermione
	as the match drew nearer, however, harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told ron and hermione
	the rest of the team wasn't too calm, either
	the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he went
	at times, he even wondered whether snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own
	potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, snape was so horrible to harry
	could snape possibly know they'd found out about the sorcerer's stone harry didn't see how he could  yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could read minds
	harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that ron and hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again
	this wasn't what you'd call comforting
	harry hardly heard a word of wood's pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two thousand
	ron and hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match
	little did harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly practicing the leglocker curse
	they'd gotten the idea from malfoy using it on neville, and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harry
	now, don't forget, it's locomotor mortis, hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve
	back in the locker room, wood had taken harry aside
	don't want to pressure you, potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch it's now
	finish the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too much
	the whole school's out there said fred weasley, peering out of the door
	even  blimey  dumbledore's come to watch harry's heart did a somersault
	dumbledore he said, dashing to the door to make sure
	there was no mistaking that silver beard
	harry could have laughed out loud with relief he was safe
	there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watching
	perhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that ron noticed, too
	i've never seen snape look so mean, he told hermione
	look they're off ouch someone had poked ron in the back of the head
	oh, sorry, weasley, didn't see you there
	malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goyle
	wonder how long potter's going to stay on his broom this time anyone want a bet what about you, weasley ron didn't answer snape had just awarded hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit a bludger at him
	hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the snitch
	you know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor team said malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all
	it's people they feel sorry for
	see, there's potter, who's got no parents, then there's the weasleys, who've got no money  you should be on the team, longbottom, you've got no brains
	neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face malfoy
	i'm worth twelve of you, malfoy, he stammered
	malfoy, crabbe, and goyle howled with laughter, but ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, you tell him, neville
	longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than weasley, and that's saying something
	ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about harry
	i'm warning you, malfoy  one more word ron said hermione suddenly, harry  what where harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd
	hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet
	you're in luck, weasley, potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground said malfoy
	before malfoy knew what was happening, ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground
	neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help
	come on, harry hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape  she didn't even notice malfoy and ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was neville, crabbe, and goyle
	up in the air, snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches  the next second, harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the snitch clasped in his hand
	the stands erupted it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quickly
	ron ron where are you the game's over harry's won we've won gryffindor is in the lead shrieked hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in front
	harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground
	he couldn't believe it
	he'd done it  the game was over it had barely lasted five minutes
	as gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw snape land nearby, whitefaced and tightlipped  then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into dumbledore's smiling face
	well done, said dumbledore quietly, so that only harry could hear
	nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror
	snape spat bitterly on the ground
	harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed
	he couldn't ever remember feeling happier
	he'd really done something to be proud of now  no one could say he was just a famous name any more
	the evening air had never smelled so sweet
	he walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders ron and hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed
	harry had reached the shed
	he leaned against the wooden door and looked up at hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun
	gryffindor in the lead
	he'd done it, he'd shown snape
	and speaking of snape
	a hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle
	clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest
	harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched
	he recognized the figure's prowling walk
	snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner  what was going on harry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand and took off
	gliding silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a run
	the trees were so thick he couldn't see where snape had gone
	he flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices
	he glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree
	he climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves
	below, in a shadowy clearing, stood snape, but he wasn't alone
	quirrell was there, too
	harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever
	harry strained to catch what they were saying
	ddon't know why you wanted ttto meet here of all pplaces, severus
	oh, i thought we'd keep this private, said snape, his voice icy
	students aren't supposed to know about the sorcerer's stone, after all
	harry leaned forward
	quirrell was mumbling something
	snape interrupted him
	have you found out how to get past that beast of hagrid's yet bbbut severus, i  you don't want me as your enemy, quirrell, said snape, taking a step toward him
	ii don't know what you you know perfectly well what i mean
	an owl hooted loudly, and harry nearly fell out of the tree
	he steadied himself in time to hear snape say,  your little bit of hocuspocus
	bbut i dddon't  very well, snape cut in
	we'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie
	he threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing
	it was almost dark now, but harry could see quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified
	harry, where have you been hermione squeaked
	we won you won we won shouted ron, thumping harry on the back
	and i gave malfoy a black eye, and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle singlehanded he's still out cold but madam pomftey says he'll be all right  talk about showing slytherin everyone's waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, fred and george stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens
	never mind that now, said harry breathlessly
	let's find an empty room, you wait 'til you hear this
	he made sure peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he'd seen and heard
	so we were right, it is the sorcerer's stone, and snape's trying to force quirrell to help him get it
	he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy  and he said something about quirrell's 'hocus pocuss i reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and quirrell would have done some antidark arts spell that snape needs to break through  so you mean the stone's only safe as long as quirrell stands up to snape said hermione in alarm
	it'll be gone by next tuesday, said ron
	chapter fourteen norbert the norwegian ridgeback quirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought
	in the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn't look as though he'd cracked yet
	every time they passed the thirdfloor corridor, harry, ron, and hermione would press their ears to the door to check that fluffy was still growling inside
	snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the stone was still safe
	whenever harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrell's stutter
	hermione, however, had more on her mind than the sorcerer's stone
	she had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes
	harry and ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same
	hermione, the exams are ages away
	ten weeks, hermione snapped
	that's not ages, that's like a second to nicolas flamel
	but we're not six hundred years old, ron reminded her
	anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it a
	what am i studying for are you crazy you realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year they're very important, i should have started studying a month ago, i don't know what's gotten into me
	unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as hermione
	they piled so much homework on them that the easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the christmas ones
	it was hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements
	moaning and yawning, harry and ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work
	i'll never remember this, ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window
	it was the first really fine day they'd had in months
	the sky was a clear, forgetmenot blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming
	harry, who was looking up dittany in one thousand magical herbs and fungi, didn't look up until he heard ron say, hagrid what are you doing in the library hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back
	he looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat
	jus' lookin', he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once
	an' what're you lot up ter he looked suddenly suspicious
	yer not still lookin' fer nicolas flamel, are yeh oh, we found out who he is ages ago, said ron impressively
	and we know what that dog's guarding, it's a sorcerer's st  shhhh hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening
	don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh there are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact, said harry, about what's guarding the stone apart from fluffy  shhhh said hagrid again
	listen  come an' see me later, i'm not promisin' i'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know
	they'll think i've told yeh  see you later, then, said harry
	what was he hiding behind his back said hermione thoughtfully
	do you think it had anything to do with the stone i'm going to see what section he was in, said ron, who'd had enough of working
	he came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table
	dragons he whispered
	hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons look at these dragon species of great britain and ireland from egg to inferno, a dragon keeper's guide
	hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time i ever met him,  said harry
	but it's against our laws, said ron
	dragon breeding was outlawed by the warlocks' convention of 1709, everyone knows that
	it's hard to stop muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden  anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous
	you should see the burns charlie's got off wild ones in romania
	but there aren't wild dragons in britain said harry
	of course there are, said ron
	common welsh green and hebridean blacks
	the ministry of magic has a job hushing them up, i can tell you
	our kind have to keep putting spells on muggles who've spotted them, to make them forget
	so what on earths hagrid up to said hermione
	when they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed
	hagrid called who is it before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them
	it was stifling hot inside
	even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate
	hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused
	so  yeh wanted to ask me somethin' yes, said harry
	there was no point beating around the bush
	we were wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the sorcerer's stone apart from fluffy
	hagrid frowned at him
	0' course i cant, he said
	number one, i don' know meself
	number two, yeh know too much already, so i wouldn' tell yeh if i could
	that stone's here fer a good reason
	it was almost stolen outta gringotts  i s'ppose yeh've worked that out an' all beats me how yeh even know abou' fluffy
	oh, come on, hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here, said hermione in a warm, flattering voice
	hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling
	we only wondered who had done the guarding, really
	we wondered who dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you
	hagrid's chest swelled at these last words
	harry and ron beamed at hermione
	well, i don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that
	he borrowed fluffy from me
	then some o' the teachers did enchantments
	professor sprout  professor flitwick  professor mcgonagall  he ticked them off on his fingers, professor quirrell  an' dumbledore himself did somethin', o' course
	hang on, i've forgotten someone
	oh yeah, professor snape
	snape yeah  yer not still on abou' that, are yeh look, snape helped protect the stone, he's not about ter steal it
	harry knew ron and hermione were thinking the same as he was
	if snape had been in on protecting the stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it
	he probably knew everything  except, it seemed, quirrell's spell and how to get past fluffy
	you're the only one who knows how to get past fluffy
	aren't you, hagrid said harry anxiously
	and you wouldn't tell anyone, would you not even one of the teachers not a soul knows except me an' dumbledore, said hagrid proudly
	well, that's something, harry muttered to the others
	hagrid, can we have a window open i'm boiling
	can't, harry, sorry, said hagrid
	harry noticed him glance at the fire
	harry looked at it, too
	hagrid  what's that but he already knew what it was
	in the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg
	ah, said hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, that's er
	where did you get it, hagrid said ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg
	it must've cost you a fortune
	i was down in the village havin' a few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger
	think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest
	but what are you going to do with it when it's hatched said hermione
	well, i've bin doin' some readin' , said hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow
	got this outta the library  dragon breeding for pleasure and profit  it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's all in here
	keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe on i em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour
	an' see here  how ter recognize diff'rent eggs  what i got there's a norwegian ridgeback
	he looked very pleased with himself, but hermione didn't
	hagrid, you live in a wooden house, she said
	but hagrid wasn't listening
	he was humming merrily as he stoked the fire
	so now they had something else to worry about what might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut
	wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life, ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting
	hermione had now started making study schedules for harry and ron, too
	it was driving them nuts
	then, one breakfast time, hedwig brought harry another note from hagrid
	he had written only two words it's hatching
	ron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to the hut
	hermione wouldn't hear of it
	hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching we've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing  shut up harry whispered
	malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen
	how much had he heard harry didn't like the look on malfoy's face at all
	ron and hermione argued all the way to herbology and in the end, hermione agreed to run down to hagrid's with the other two during morning break
	when the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest
	hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited
	he ushered them inside
	the egg was lying on the table
	there were deep cracks in it
	something was moving inside a funny clicking noise was coming from it
	they all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath
	all at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open
	the baby dragon flopped onto the table
	it wasn't exactly pretty harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella
	its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes
	a couple of sparks flew out of its snout
	isn't he beautiful hagrid murmured
	he reached out a hand to stroke the dragon's head
	it snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs
	bless him, look, he knows his mommy said hagrid
	hagrid, said hermione, how fast do norwegian ridgebacks grow, exactly hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face  he leapt to his feet and ran to the window
	what's the matter someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtains  it's a kid  he's runnin' back up ter the school
	harry bolted to the door and looked out
	even at a distance there was no mistaking him
	malfoy had seen the dragon
	something about the smile lurking on malfoy's face during the next week made harry, ron, and hermione very nervous
	they spent most of their free time in hagrid's darkened hut, trying to reason with him
	just let him go, harry urged
	i can't, said hagrid
	they looked at the dragon
	it had grown three times in length in just a week
	smoke kept furling out of its nostrils
	hagrid hadn't been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy
	there were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor
	i've decided to call him norbert, said hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes
	he really knows me now, watch
	norbert norbert where's mommy he's lost his marbles, ron muttered in harry's ear
	hagrid, said harry loudly, give it two weeks and norbert's going to be as long as your house
	malfoy could go to dumbledore at any moment
	i  i know i can't keep him forever, but i can't jus' dump him, i can't
	harry suddenly turned to ron
	you're losing it, too, said ron
	i'm ron, remember no  charlie  your brother, charlie
	we could send norbert to him
	charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild brilliant said ron
	how about it, hagrid and in the end, hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to charlie to ask him
	the following week dragged by
	wednesday night found hermione and harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed
	the clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open
	ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off harry's invisibility cloak
	he had been down at hagrid's hut, helping him feed norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate
	it bit me he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief
	i'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week
	i tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal i've ever met, but the way hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit
	when it bit me he told me off for frightening it
	and when i left, he was singing it a lullaby
	there was a tap on the dark window
	it's hedwig said harry, hurrying to let her in
	she'll have charlie's answer the three of them put their heads together to read the note
	dear ron, how are you thanks for the letter  i'd be glad to take the norwegian ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting him here
	i think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week
	trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon
	could you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on saturday they can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark
	send me an answer as soon as possible
	love, charlie they looked at one another
	we've got the invisibility cloak, said harry
	it shouldn't be too difficult  i think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and norbert
	it was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him
	anything to get rid of norbert  and malfoy
	by the next morning, ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size
	he didn't know whether it was safe to go to madam pomfrey  would she recognize a dragon bite by the afternoon, though, he had no choice
	the cut had turned a nasty shade of green
	it looked as if norbert's fangs were poisonous
	harry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in bed
	it's not just my hand, he whispered, although that feels like it's about to fall off
	malfoy told madam pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me
	he kept threatening to tell her what really bit me  i've told her it was a dog, but i don't think she believes me i shouldn't have hit him at the quidditch match, that's why he's doing this
	harry and hermione tried to calm ron down
	it'll all be over at midnight on saturday, said hermione, but this didn't soothe ron at all
	on the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat
	midnight on saturday he said in a hoarse voice
	oh no oh no  i've just remembered  charlie's letter was in that book malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of norbert
	harry and hermione didn't get a chance to answer
	madam pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying ron needed sleep
	it's too late to change the plan now, harry told hermione
	we haven't got time to send charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of norbert
	we'll have to risk it
	and we have got the invisibility cloak, malfoy doesn't know about that
	they found fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them
	i won't let you in, he puffed
	norbert's at a tricky stage  nothin' i can't handle
	when they told him about charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because norbert had just bitten him on the leg
	aargh it's all right, he only got my boot  jus' playin'  he's only a baby, after all
	the baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle
	harry and hermione walked back to the castle feeling saturday couldn't come quickly enough
	they would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time came for him to say goodbye to norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do
	it was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall
	hagrid had norbert packed and ready in a large crate
	he's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer the journey, said hagrid in a muffled voice
	an' i've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely
	from inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off
	byebye, norbert hagrid sobbed, as harry and hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves
	mommy will never forget you how they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew
	midnight ticked nearer as they heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors
	up another staircase, then another  even one of harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier
	nearly there harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower
	then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate
	forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away
	professor mcgonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had malfoy by the ear
	detention she shouted
	and twenty points from slytherin wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you  you don't understand, professor
	harry potter's coming  he's got a dragon what utter rubbish how dare you tell such lies come on  i shall see professor snape about you, malfoy the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that
	not until they'd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again
	hermione did a sort of jig
	malfoy's got detention i could sing don't, harry advised her
	chuckling about malfoy, they waited, norbert thrashing about in his crate
	about ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness
	charlie's friends were a cheery lot
	they showed harry and hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend norbert between them
	they all helped buckle norbert safely into it and then harry and hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much
	at last, norbert was going
	they slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that norbert was off them
	no more dragon  malfoy in detention  what could spoil their happiness the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs
	as they stepped into the corridor, filch's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness
	well, well, well, he whispered, we are in trouble
	they'd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower
	chapter fifteen the foribidden forest things couldn't have been worse
	filch took them down to professor mcgonagall's study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other
	hermione was trembling
	excuses, alibis, and wild cover up stories chased each other around harry's brain, each more feeble than the last
	he couldn't see how they were going to get out of trouble this time
	how could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak there was no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was outofbounds except for classes
	add norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already
	had harry thought that things couldn't have been worse he was wrong
	when professor mcgonagall appeared, she was leading neville
	harry neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two
	i was trying to find you to warn you, i heard malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag  harry shook his head violently to shut neville up, but professor mcgonagall had seen
	she looked more likely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over the three of them
	i would never have believed it of any of you
	filch says you were up in the astronomy tower
	it's one o'clock in the morning
	it was the first time hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's question
	she was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue
	i think i've got a good idea of what's been going on, said professor mcgonagall
	it doesn't take a genius to work it out
	you fed draco malfoy some cockandbull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble
	i've already caught him
	i suppose you think it's funny that longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too harry caught neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn't true, because neville was looking stunned and hurt
	poor, blundering neville  harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them
	i'm disgusted, said professor mcgonagall
	four students out of bed in one night i've never heard of such a thing before you, miss granger, i thought you had more sense
	potter, i thought gryffindor meant more to you than this
	all three of you will receive detentions  yes, you too, mr
	longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it's very dangerous  and fifty points will be taken from gryffindor
	fifty harry gasped  they would lose the lead, the lead he'd won in the last quidditch match
	fifty points each, said professor mcgonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose
	professor  please you can't  don't tell me what i can and can't do, potter
	now get back to bed, all of you
	i've never been more ashamed of gryffindor students
	a hundred and fifty points lost
	that put gryffindor in last place
	in one night, they'd ruined any chance gryffindor had had for the house cup
	harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach
	how could they ever make up for this harry didn't sleep all night
	he could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours
	harry couldn't think of anything to say to comfort him
	he knew neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn
	what would happen when the rest of gryffindor found out what they'd done at first, gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there'd been a mistake
	how could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday and then the story started to spread harry potter, the famous harry potter, their hero of two quidditch matches, had lo st them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years
	from being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, harry was suddenly the most hated
	even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see slytherin lose the house cup
	everywhere harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him
	slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, thanks potter, we owe you one only ron stood by him
	they'll all forget this in a few weeks
	fred and george have lost loads of points in all the time they've been here, and people still like them
	they've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they said harry miserably
	well  no, ron admitted
	it was a bit late to repair the damage, but harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on
	he'd had it with sneaking around and spying
	he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to wood and offered to resign from the quidditch team
	resign wood thundered
	what good'll that do how are we going to get any points back if we can't win at quidditch but even quidditch had lost its fun
	the rest of the team wouldn't speak to harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him the seeker
	hermione and neville were suffering, too
	they didn't have as bad a time as harry, because they weren't as wellknown, but nobody would speak to them, either
	hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence
	harry was almost glad that the exams weren't far away
	all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery
	he, ron, and hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions
	then, about a week before the exams were due to start, harry's new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put to an unexpected test
	walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead
	as he drew closer, he heard quirrell's voice
	no  no  not again, please  it sounded as though someone was threatening him
	all right  all right  he heard quirrell sob
	next second, quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban
	he was pale and looked as though he was about to cry
	he strode out of sight harry didn't think quirrell had even noticed him
	he waited until quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom
	it was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end
	harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised himself about not meddling
	all the same, he'd have gambled twelve sorcerer's stones that snape had just left the room, and from what harry had just heard, snape would be walking with a new spring in his step  quirrell seemed to have given in at last
	harry went back to the library, where hermione was testing ron on astronomy
	harry told them what he'd heard
	snape's done it, then said ron
	if quirrell's told him how to break his antidark force spell  there's still fluffy, though, said hermione
	maybe snape's found out how to get past him without asking hagrid, said ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them
	i bet there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant threeheaded dog
	so what do we do, harry the light of adventure was kindling again in ron's eyes, but hermione answered before harry could
	that's what we should have done ages ago
	if we try anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure
	but we've got no proof said harry
	quirrell's too scared to back us up
	snape's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor  who do you think they'll believe, him or us it's not exactly a secret we hate him, dumbledore'll think we made it up to get him sacked
	filch wouldn't help us if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he'll think
	and don't forget, we're not supposed to know about the stone or fluffy
	that'll take a lot of explaining
	hermione looked convinced, but ron didn't
	if we just do a bit of poking around  no, said harry flatly, we've done enough poking around
	he pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons
	the following morning, notes were delivered to harry, hermione, and neville at the breakfast table
	they were all the same your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight
	filch in the entrance hall
	professor mcgonagall harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they'd lost
	he half expected hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't say a word
	like harry, she felt they deserved what they'd got
	at eleven o'clock that night, they said goodbye to ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with neville
	filch was already there  and so was malfoy
	harry had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten a detention, too
	follow me, said filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside
	i bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won't you, eh he said, leering at them
	hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me
	it's just a pity they let the old punishments die out
	hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, i've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever needed
	right, off we go, and don't think of running off, now, it'll be worse for you if you do
	they marched off across the dark grounds
	neville kept sniffing
	harry wondered what their punishment was going to be
	it must be something really horrible, or filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted
	the moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness
	ahead, harry could see the lighted windows of hagrid's hut
	then they heard a distant shout
	is that you, filch hurry up, i want ter get started
	harry's heart rose if they were going to be working with hagrid it wouldn't be so bad
	his relief must have showed in his face, because filch said, i suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself with that oaf well, think again, boy  it's into the forest you're going and i'm much mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece
	at this, neville let out a little moan, and malfoy stopped dead in his tracks
	the forest he repeated, and he didn't sound quite as cool as usual
	we can't go in there at night  there's all sorts of things in there  werewolves, i heard
	neville clutched the sleeve of harry's robe and made a choking noise
	that's your problem, isn't it said filch, his voice cracking with glee
	should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn't you hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, fang at his heel
	he was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder
	i bin waitin' fer half an hour already
	all right, harry, hermione i shouldn't be too friendly to them, hagrid, said filch coldly, they're here to be punished, after all
	that's why yer late, is it said hagrid, frowning at filch
	bin lecturin' them, eh 'snot your place ter do that
	yeh've done yer bit, i'll take over from here
	i'll be back at dawn, said filch, for what's left of them, he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness
	malfoy now turned to hagrid
	i'm not going in that forest, he said, and harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice
	yeh are if yeh want ter stay at hogwarts, said hagrid fiercely
	yeh've done wrong an' now yehve got ter pay fer it
	but this is servant stuff, it's not for students to do
	i thought we'd be copying lines or something, if my father knew i was doing this, he'd tell yer that's how it is at hogwarts, hagrid growled
	copyin' lines what good's that ter anyone yeh'll do summat useful or yeh'll get out
	if yeh think yer father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an' pack
	go on' malfoy didn't move
	he looked at hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze
	right then, said hagrid, now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous what we're gonna do tonight, an' i don' want no one takin' risks
	follow me over here a moment
	he led them to the very edge of the forest
	holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees
	a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest
	look there, said hagrid, see that stuff shinin' on the ground silvery stuff that's unicorn blood
	there's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat
	this is the second time in a week
	i found one dead last wednesday
	we're gonna try an' find the poor thing
	we might have ter put it out of its misery
	and what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first said malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice
	there's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with me or fang, said hagrid
	an' keep ter the path
	right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent directions
	there's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' around since last night at least
	i want fang, said malfoy quickly, looking at fang's long teeth
	all right, but i warn yeh, he's a coward, said hagrid
	so me, harry, an' hermione'll go one way an' draco, neville, an' fang'll go the other
	now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right get yer wands out an' practice now  that's it  an' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh  so, be careful  let's go
	the forest was black and silent
	a little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and harry, hermione, and hagrid took the left path while malfoy, neville, and fang took the right
	they walked in silence, their eyes on the ground
	every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silverblue blood on the fallen leaves
	harry saw that hagrid looked very worried
	could a werewolf be killing the unicorns harry asked
	not fast enough, said hagrid
	it's not easy ter catch a unicorn, they're powerful magic creatures
	i never knew one ter be hurt before
	they walked past a mossy tree stump
	harry could hear running water there must be a stream somewhere close by
	there were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path
	you all right, hermione hagrid whispered
	don' worry, it can't've gone far if it's this badly hurt, an' then we'll be able ter  get behind that tree hagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak
	he pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire
	the three of them listened
	something was slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground
	hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away
	i knew it,  he murmured
	there's summat in here that shouldn' be
	a werewolf harry suggested
	that wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither, said hagrid grimly
	right, follow me, but careful, now
	they walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound
	suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved
	who's there hagrid called
	show yerself  i'm armed and into the clearing came  was it a man, or a horse to the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail
	harry and hermione's jaws dropped
	oh, it's you, ronan, said hagrid in relief
	how are yeh he walked forward and shook the centaur's hand
	good evening to you, hagrid, said ronan
	he had a deep, sorrowful voice
	were you going to shoot me can't be too careful, ronan, said hagrid, patting his crossbow
	there's summat bad loose in this forest
	this is harry potter an' hermione granger, by the way
	students up at the school
	an' this is ronan, you two
	we'd noticed, said hermione faintly
	good evening, said ronan
	students, are you and do you learn much, up at the school erm  a bit, said hermione timidly
	well, that's something
	he flung back his head and stared at the sky
	mars is bright tonight
	yeah, said hagrid, glancing up, too
	listen, i'm glad we've run inter yeh, ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt  you seen anythin' ronan didn't answer immediately
	he stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again
	always the innocent are the first victims, he said
	so it has been for ages past, so it is now
	yeah, said hagrid, but have yeh seen anythin', ronan anythin' unusual mars is bright tonight, ronan repeated, while hagrid watched him impatiently
	yeah, but i was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home, said hagrid
	so yeh haven't noticed anythin' strange yet again, ronan took a while to answer
	at last, he said, the forest hides many secrets
	a movement in the trees behind ronan made hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, blackhaired and bodied and wilderlooking than ronan
	hullo, bane, said hagrid
	all right good evening, hagrid, i hope you are well well enough
	look, i've jus' bin askin' ronan, you seen anythin' odd in here lately there's a unicorn bin injured  would yeh know anythin' about it bane walked over to stand next to ronan
	mars is bright tonight, he said simply
	we've heard, said hagrid grumpily
	well, if either of you do see anythin', let me know, won't yeh we'll be off, then
	harry and hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at ronan and bane until the trees blocked their view
	never, said hagrid irritably, try an' get a straight answer out of a centaur
	not interested in anythin' closer'n the moon
	are there many of them in here asked hermione
	keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they're good enough about turnin' up if ever i want a word
	they're deep, mind, centaurs
	jus' don' let on much
	d'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier said harry
	did that sound like hooves to you nah, if yeh ask me, that was what's bin killin' the unicorns  never heard anythin' like it before
	they walked on through the dense, dark trees
	harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder
	he had the nasty feeling they were being watched
	he was very glad they had hagrid and his crossbow with them
	they had just passed a bend in the path when hermione grabbed hagrid's arm
	hagrid look red sparks, the others are in trouble you two wait here hagrid shouted
	stay on the path, i'll come back for yeh they heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them
	you don't think they've been hurt, do you whispered hermione
	i don't care if malfoy has, but if something's got neville
	it's our fault he's here in the first place
	the minutes dragged by
	their ears seemed sharper than usual
	harry's seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig
	what was going on where were the others at last, a great crunching noise announced hagrid's return
	malfoy, neville, and fang were with him
	malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind neville and grabbed him as a joke
	neville had panicked and sent up the sparks
	we'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were makin'
	right, we're changin' groups  neville, you stay with me an' hermione, harry, you go with fang an' this idiot
	i'm sorry, hagrid added in a whisper to harry, but he'll have a harder time frightenin' you, an' we've gotta get this done
	so harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang
	they walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick
	harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker
	there were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by
	harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak
	look  he murmured, holding out his arm to stop malfoy
	something bright white was gleaming on the ground
	it was the unicorn all right, and it was dead
	harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad
	its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearlywhite on the dark leaves
	harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood
	a bush on the edge of the clearing quivered
	then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast
	harry, malfoy, and fang stood transfixed
	the cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood
	aaaaaaaaaargh malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted  so did fang
	the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at harry  unicorn blood was dribbling down its front
	it got to its feet and came swiftly toward harry  he couldn't move for fear
	then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head it was as though his scar were on fire
	half blinded, he staggered backward
	he heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over harry, charging at the figure
	the pain in harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees
	it took a minute or two to pass
	when he looked up, the figure had gone
	a centaur was standing over him, not ronan or bane this one looked younger he had whiteblond hair and a palomino body
	are you all right said the centaur, pulling harry to his feet
	yes  thank you  what was that the centaur didn't answer
	he had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires
	he looked carefully at harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on harry's forehead
	you are the potter boy, he said
	you had better get back to hagrid
	the forest is not safe at this time  especially for you
	can you ride it will be quicker this way
	my name is firenze, he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his back
	there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing
	ronan and bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty
	firenze bane thundered
	what are you doing you have a human on your back have you no shame are you a common mule do you realize who this is said firenze
	this is the potter boy
	the quicker he leaves this forest, the better
	what have you been telling him growled bane
	remember, firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens
	have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ronan pawed the ground nervously
	i'm sure firenze thought he was acting for the best,  he said in his gloomy voice
	bane kicked his back legs in anger
	for the best what is that to do with us centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on
	do you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane
	do you not understand why it was killed or have the planets not let you in on that secret i set myself against what is lurking in this forest, bane, yes, with humans alongside me if i must
	and firenze whisked around with harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving ronan and bane behind them
	harry didn't have a clue what was going on
	why's bane so angry he asked
	what was that thing you saved me from, anyway firenze slowed to a walk, warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of lowhanging branches, but did not answer harry's question
	they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that harry thought firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore
	they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when firenze suddenly stopped
	harry potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for no, said harry, startled by the odd question
	we've only used the horn and tail hair in potions
	that is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn, said firenze
	only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime
	the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price
	you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a halflife, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips
	harry stared at the back of firenze's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight
	but who'd be that desperate he wondered aloud
	if you're going to be cursed forever, deaths better, isn't it it is, firenze agreed, unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else  something that will bring you back to full strength and power  something that will mean you can never die
	potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment the sorcerer's stone of course  the elixir of life but i don't understand who  can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harry's heart
	over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he died
	codswallop, in my opinion
	dunno if he had enough human left in him to die
	do you mean, harry croaked, that was vol harry harry, are you all right hermione was running toward them down the path, hagrid puffing along behind her
	i'm fine, said harry, hardly knowing what he was saying
	the unicorn's dead, hagrid, it's in that clearing back there
	this is where i leave you, firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn
	harry slid off his back
	good luck, harry potter, said firenze
	the planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs
	i hope this is one of those times
	he turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving harry shivering behind him
	ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return
	he shouted something about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him awake
	in a matter of seconds, though, he was wideeyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what had happened in the forest
	harry couldn't sit down
	he paced up and down in front of the fire
	he was still shaking
	snape wants the stone for voldemort
	and voldemort's waiting in the forest
	and all this time we thought snape just wanted to get rich
	stop saying the name said ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought voldemort could hear them
	harry wasn't listening
	firenze saved me, but he shouldn't have done so
	he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen
	they must show that voldemort's coming back
	bane thinks firenze should have let voldemort kill me
	i suppose that's written in the stars as well
	will you stop saying the name ron hissed
	so all i've got to wait for now is snape to steal the stone, harry went on feverishly, then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off
	well, i suppose bane'll be happy
	hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort
	harry, everyone says dumbledore's the only one youknowwho was ever afraid of with dumbledore around, youknowwho won't touch you
	anyway, who says the centaurs are right it sounds like fortunetelling to me, and professor mcgonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic
	the sky had turned light before they stopped talking
	they went to bed exhausted, their throats sore
	but the night's surprises weren't over
	when harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them
	there was a note pinned to it just in case
	chapter sixteen through the trapdoor in years to come, harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment
	yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door
	it was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers
	they had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an anticheating spell
	they had practical exams as well
	professor flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk
	professor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox  points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers
	snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion
	harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest
	neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerves because harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it
	maybe it was because they hadn't seen what harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but ron and hermione didn't seem as worried about the stone as harry
	the idea of voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up to
	their very last exam was history of magic
	one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out
	when the ghost of professor binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, harry couldn't help cheering with the rest
	that was far easier than i thought it would be, said hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds
	i needn't have learned about the 1637 werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of elfric the eager
	hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree
	the weasley twins and lee jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows
	no more studying, ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass
	you could look more cheerful, harry, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet
	harry was rubbing his forehead
	i wish i knew what this means he burst out angrily
	my scar keeps hurting  it's happened before, but never as often as this
	go to madam pomfrey, hermione suggested
	i'm not ill, said harry
	i think it's a warning
	it means danger's coming
	ron couldn't get worked up, it was too hot
	harry, relax, hermione's right, the stone's safe as long as dumbledore's around
	anyway, we've never had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy
	he nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry
	and neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid lets dumbledore down
	harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important
	when he tried to explain this, hermione said, that's just the exams
	i woke up last night and was halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered we'd done that one
	harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though
	he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth
	hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters
	hagrid would never betray dumbledore
	hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy
	but  harry suddenly jumped to his feet
	where're you going said ron sleepily
	i've just thought of something, said harry
	we've got to go and see hagrid, now
	why panted hermione, hurrying to keep up
	don't you think it's a bit odd, said harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, that what hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket how many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law lucky they found hagrid, don't you think why didn't i see it before what are you talking about said ron, but harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn't answer
	hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl
	hullo, he said, smiling
	finished yer exams got time fer a drink yes, please, said ron, but harry cut him off
	no, we're in a hurry
	hagrid, i've got to ask you something
	you know that night you won norbert what did the stranger you were playing cards with look like dunno, said hagrid casually, he wouldn' take his cloak off
	he saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows
	it's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the hog's head  that's the pub down in the village
	mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn' he i never saw his face, he kept his hood up
	harry sank down next to the bowl of peas
	what did you talk to him about, hagrid did you mention hogwarts at all mighta come up, said hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember
	he asked what i did, an' i told him i was gamekeeper here
	he asked a bit about the sorta creatures i took after
	an' i said what i'd always really wanted was a dragon
	i can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks
	yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play cards fer it if i wanted
	but he had ter be sure i could handle it, he didn' want it ter go ter any old home
	so i told him, after fluffy, a dragon would be easy
	and did he  did he seem interested in fluffy harry asked, try ing to keep his voice calm
	well  yeah  how many threeheaded dogs d'yeh meet, even around hogwarts so i told him, fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep  hagrid suddenly looked horrified
	i shouldn'ta told yeh that he blurted out
	forget i said it hey  where're yeh goin' harry, ron, and hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds
	we've got to go to dumbledore, said harry
	hagrid told that stranger how to get past fluffy, and it was either snape or voldemort under that cloak  it must've been easy, once he'd got hagrid drunk
	i just hope dumbledore believes us
	firenze might back us up if bane doesn't stop him
	where's dumbledore's office they looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction
	they had never been told where dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him
	we'll just have to  harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall
	what are you three doing inside it was professor mcgonagall, carrying a large pile of books
	we want to see professor dumbledore, said hermione, rather bravely, harry and ron thought
	see professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do
	why harry swallowed  now what it's sort of secret, he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because professor mcgonagall's nostrils flared
	professor dumbledore left ten minutes ago, she said coldly
	he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and flew off for london at once
	he's gone said harry frantically
	now professor dumbledore is a very great wizard, potter, he has many demands on his time  but this is important
	something you have to say is more important than the ministry of magic, potter
	look, said harry, throwing caution to the winds, professor  it's about the sorcerer's tone  whatever professor mcgonagall had expected, it wasn't that
	the books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up
	how do you know  she spluttered
	professor, i think  i know  that sn that someone's going to try and steal the stone
	i've got to talk to professor dumbledore
	she eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion
	professor dumbledore will be back tomorrow, she said finally
	i don't know how you found out about the stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it's too well protected
	but professor  potter, i know what i'm talking about, she said shortly
	she bent down and gathered up the fallen books
	i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine
	it's tonight, said harry, once he was sure professor mcgonagall was out of earshot
	snape's going through the trapdoor tonight
	he's found out everything he needs, and now he's got dumbledore out of the way
	he sent that note, i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turns up
	but what can we  hermione gasped
	harry and ron wheeled round
	snape was standing there
	good afternoon, he said smoothly
	you shouldn't be inside on a day like this, he said, with an odd, twisted smile
	we were  harry began, without any idea what he was going to say
	you want to be more careful, said snape
	hanging around like this, people will think you're up to something
	and gryffindor really can't afford to lose any more points, can it harry flushed
	they turned to go outside, but snape called them back
	be warned, potter  any more nighttime wanderings and i will personally make sure you are expelled
	he strode off in the direction of the staffroom
	out on the stone steps, harry turned to the others
	right, here's what we've got to do, he whispered urgently
	one of us has got to keep an eye on snape  wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it
	hermione, you'd better do that
	why me it's obvious, said ron
	you can pretend to be waiting for professor flitwick, you know
	he put on a high voice, 'oh professor flitwick, i'm so worried, i think i got question fourteen b wrong
	' oh, shut up, said hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for snape
	and we'd better stay outside the thirdfloor corridor, harry told ron
	but that part of the plan didn't work
	no sooner had they reached the door separating fluffy from the rest of the school than professor mcgonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper
	i suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of enchantments she stormed
	enough of this nonsense if i hear you 've come anywhere near here again, i'll take another fifty points from gryffindor yes, weasley, from my own house harry and ron went back to the common room, harry had just said, at least hermione's on snape's tail, when the portrait of the fat lady swung open and hermione came in
	i'm sorry, harry she wailed
	snape came out and asked me what i was doing, so i said i was waiting for flitwick, and snape went to get him, and i've only just got away, i don't know where snape went
	well, that's it then, isn't it harry said
	the other two stared at him
	he was pale and his eyes were glittering
	i'm going out of here tonight and i'm going to try and get to the stone first
	you can't said hermione
	after what mcgonagall and snape have said you'll be expelled so whap harry shouted
	don't you understand if snape gets hold of the stone, voldemort's coming back haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over there won't be any hogwarts to get expelled from he'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the dark arts losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see d'you think he'll leave you and your families alone if gryffindor wins the house cup if i get caught before i can get to the stone, well, i'll have to go back to the dursleys and wait for voldemort to find me there, it's only dying a bit later than i would have, because i'm never going over to the dark side i'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me voldemort killed my parents, remember he glared at them
	you're right harry, said hermione in a small voice
	i'll use the invisibility cloak, said harry
	it's just lucky i got it back
	but will it cover all three of us said ron
	all  all three of us oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone of course not, said hermione briskly
	how do you think you'd get to the stone without us i'd better go and took through my books, there might be something useful
	but if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too
	not if i can help it, said hermione grimly
	flitwick told me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam
	they're not throwing me out after that
	after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room
	nobody bothered them none of the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any more, after all
	this was the first night he hadn't been upset by it
	hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break
	harry and ron didn't talk much
	both of them were thinking about what they were about to do
	slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed
	better get the cloak, ron muttered, as lee jordan finally left, stretching and yawning
	harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory
	he putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute hagrid had given him for christmas
	he pocketed it to use on fluffy  he didn't feel much like singing
	he ran back down to the common room
	we'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us  if filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own  what are you doing said a voice from the corner of the room
	neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching trevor the toad, who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom
	nothing, neville, nothing, said harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back
	neville stared at their guilty faces
	you're going out again, he said
	no, no, no, said hermione
	why don't you go to bed, neville harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door
	they couldn't afford to waste any more time, snape might even now be playing fluffy to sleep
	you can't go out, said neville, you'll be caught again
	gryffindor will be in even more trouble
	you don't understand, said harry, this is important
	but neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate
	i won't let you do it, he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole
	i'll  i'll fight you neville, ron exploded, get away from that hole and don't be an idiot  don't you call me an idiot said neville
	i don't think you should be breaking any more rules and you were the one who told me to stand up to people yes, but not to us, said ron in exasperation
	neville, you don't know what you're doing
	he took a step forward and neville dropped trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight
	go on then, try and hit me said neville, raising his fists
	i'm ready harry turned to hermione
	do something, he said desperately
	hermione stepped forward
	neville, she said, i'm really, really sorry about this
	petrificus totalus she cried, pointing it at neville
	neville's arms snapped to his sides
	his legs sprang together
	his whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board
	hermione ran to turn him over
	neville's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak
	only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror
	what've you done to him harry whispered
	it's the full bodybind, said hermione miserably
	oh, neville, i'm so sorry
	we had to, neville, no time to explain, said harry
	you'll understand later, neville, said ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak
	but leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen
	in their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on them
	at the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted mrs
	norris skulking near the top
	oh, let's kick her, just this once, ron whispered in harry's ear, but harry shook his head
	as they climbed carefully around her, mrs
	norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything
	they didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor
	peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip
	who's there he said suddenly as they climbed toward him
	he narrowed his wicked black eyes
	know you're there, even if i can't see you
	are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie he rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them
	should call filch, i should, if something's acreeping around unseen
	harry had a sudden idea
	peeves, he said, in a hoarse whisper, the bloody baron has his own reasons for being invisible
	peeves almost fell out of the air in shock
	he caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs
	so sorry, your bloodiness, mr
	baron, sir, he said greasily
	my mistake, my mistake  i didn't see you  of course i didn't, you're invisible  forgive old peevsie his little joke, sir
	i have business here, peeves, croaked harry
	stay away from this place tonight
	i will, sir, i most certainly will, said peeves, rising up in the air again
	hope your business goes well, baron, i'll not bother you
	and he scooted off brilliant, harry whispered ron
	a few seconds later, they were there, outside the thirdfloor corridor  and the door was already ajar
	well, there you are, harry said quietly, snape's already got past fluffy
	seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them
	underneath the cloak, harry turned to the other two
	if you want to go back, i won't blame you, he said
	you can take the cloak, i won't need it now
	don't be stupid, said ron
	we're coming, said hermione
	harry pushed the door open
	as the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears
	all three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them
	what's that at its feet hermione whispered
	looks like a harp, said ron
	snape must have left it there
	it must wake up the moment you stop playing, said harry
	he put hagrid's flute to his lips and blew
	it wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop
	harry hardly drew breath
	slowly, the dog's growls ceased  it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep
	keep playing, ron warned harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor
	they could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads
	i think we'll be able to pull the door open, said ron, peering over the dog's back
	want to go first, hermione no, i don't all right
	ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs
	he bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open
	what can you see hermione said anxiously
	nothing  just black  there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop
	harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at ron to get his attention and pointed at himself
	you want to go first are you sure said ron
	i don't know how deep this thing goes
	give the flute to hermione so she can keep him asleep
	harry handed the flute over
	in the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep
	harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor
	there was no sign of the bottom
	he lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips
	then he looked up at ron and said, if anything happens to me, don't follow
	go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore, right right, said ron
	see you in a minute, i hope
	cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and  flump
	with a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft
	he sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom
	it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant
	it's okay he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, it's a soft landing, you can jump ron followed right away
	he landed, sprawled next to harry
	what's this stuff were his first words
	dunno, some sort of plant thing
	i suppose it's here to break the fall
	come on, hermione the distant music stopped
	there was a loud bark from the dog, but hermione had already jumped
	she landed on harry's other side
	we must be miles under the school , she said
	lucky this plant thing's here, really, said ron
	lucky shrieked hermione
	look at you both she leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall
	she had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles
	as for harry and ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing
	hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her
	now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them
	stop moving hermione ordered them
	i know what this is  it's devil's snare oh, i'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help, snarled ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck
	shut up, i'm trying to remember how to kill it said hermione
	well, hurry up, i can't breathe harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest
	devil's snare, devil's snare
	what did professor sprout say  it likes the dark and the damp so light a fire harry choked
	yes  of course  but there's no wood hermione cried, wringing her hands
	have you gone mad ron bellowed
	are you a witch or not oh, right said hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on snape at the plant
	in a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth
	wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free
	lucky you pay attention in herbology, hermione, said harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face
	yeah, said ron, and lucky harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis  'there's no wood,' honestly
	this way, said harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward
	all they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls
	the passageway sloped downward, and harry was reminded of gringotts
	with an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank
	if they met a dragon, a fullygrown dragon  norbert had been bad enough
	can you hear something ron whispered
	a soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead
	do you think it's a ghost i don't know
	sounds like wings to me
	there's light ahead  i can see something moving
	they reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them
	it was full of small, jewelbright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room
	on the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door
	do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room said ron
	probably, said harry
	they don't look very vicious, but i suppose if they all swooped down at once
	well, there's no other choice
	he took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room
	he expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened
	he reached the door untouched
	he pulled the handle, but it was locked
	the other two followed him
	they tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when hermione tried her alohomora charm
	they can't be here just for decoration, said hermione
	they watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering  glittering they're not birds harry said suddenly
	they're keys winged keys  look carefully
	he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys
	yes  look broomsticks we've got to catch the key to the door but there are hundreds of them ron examined the lock on the door
	we're looking for a big, oldfashioned one  probably silver, like the handle
	they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys
	they grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one
	not for nothing, though, was harry the youngest seeker in a century
	he had a knack for spotting things other people didn't
	after a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole
	that one he called to the others
	that big one  there  no, there  with bright blue wings  the feathers are all crumpled on one side
	ron went speeding in the direction that harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom
	we've got to close in on it harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing
	ron, you come at it from above  hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and i'll try and catch it
	right, now ron dived, hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and harry streaked after it it sped toward the wall, harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand
	ron and hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber
	they landed quickly, and harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand
	he rammed it into the lock and turned  it worked
	the moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice
	ready harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle
	he pulled the door open
	the next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all
	but as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight
	they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone
	facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces
	harry, ron and hermione shivered slightly  the towering white chessmen had no faces
	now what do we do harry whispered
	it's obvious, isn't it said ron
	we've got to play our way across the room
	behind the white pieces they could see another door
	how said hermione nervously
	i think, said ron, we're going to have to be chessmen
	he walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse
	at once, the stone sprang to life
	the horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at ron
	do we  er  have to join you to get across the black knight nodded
	ron turned to the other two
	this needs thinking about he said
	i suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces
	harry and hermione stayed quiet, watching ron think
	finally he said, now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess  we're not offended, said harry quickly
	just tell us what to do
	well, harry, you take the place of that bishop, and hermione, you 90 next to him instead of that castle
	what about you i'm going to be a knight, said ron
	the chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that harry, ron, and hermione took
	white always plays first in chess, said ron, peering across the board
	a white pawn had moved forward two squares
	ron started to direct the black pieces
	they moved silently wherever he sent them
	harry's knees were trembling
	what if they lost harry  move diagonally four squares to the right
	their first real shock came when their other knight was taken
	the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown
	had to let that happen, said ron, looking shaken
	leaves you free to take that bishop, hermione, go on
	every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy
	soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall
	twice, ron only just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in danger
	he himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones
	we're nearly there, he muttered suddenly
	let me think let me think
	the white queen turned her blank face toward him
	said ron softly, it's the only way
	i've got to be taken
	nof harry and hermione shouted
	that's chess snapped ron
	you've got to make some sacrifices i take one step forward and she'll take me  that leaves you free to checkmate the king, harry but  do you want to stop snape or not ron  look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the stone there was no alternative
	ready ron called, his face pale but determined
	here i go  now, don't hang around once you've won
	he stepped forward, and the white queen pounced
	she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor  hermione screamed but stayed on her square  the white queen dragged ron to one side
	he looked as if he'd been knocked out
	shaking, harry moved three spaces to the left
	the white king took off his crown and threw it at harry's feet
	the chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear
	with one last desperate look back at ron, harry and hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway
	what if he's  he'll be all right, said harry, trying to convince himself
	what do you reckon's next we've had sprout's, that was the devil's snare flitwick must've put charms on the keys mcgonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive that leaves quirrell's spell, and snape's
	they had reached another door
	all right harry whispered
	harry pushed it open
	a disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses
	eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head
	i'm glad we didn't have to fight that one, harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs
	come on, i can't breathe
	he pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next  but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line
	what do we have to do they stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway
	it wasn't ordinary fire either it was purple
	at the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward
	look hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles
	harry looked over her shoulder to read it danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, two of us will help you, which ever you would find, one among us seven will let you move ahead, another will transport the drinker back instead, two among our number hold only nettle wine, three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line
	choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, to help you in your choice, we give you these clues four first, however slyly the poison tries to hide you will always find some on nettle wine's left side second, different are those who stand at either end, but if you would move onward, neither is your friend third, as you see clearly, all are different size, neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides fourth, the second left and the second on the right are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight
	hermione let out a great sigh and harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing
	brilliant, said hermione
	this isn't magic  it's logic  a puzzle
	a lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever
	but so will we, won't we of course not, said hermione
	everything we need is here on this paper
	seven bottles three are poison two are wine one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple
	but how do we know which to drink give me a minute
	hermione read the paper several times
	then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them
	at last, she clapped her hands
	the smallest bottle will get us through the black fire  toward the stone
	harry looked at the tiny bottle
	there's only enough there for one of us, he said
	that's hardly one swallow
	they looked at each other
	which one will get you back through the purple flames hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line
	you drink that, said harry
	no, listen, get back and get ron
	grab brooms from the flying key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy  go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore, we need him
	i might be able to hold snape off for a while, but i'm no match for him, really
	but harry  what if youknowwho's with him well  i was lucky once, wasn't i said harry, pointing at his scar
	i might get lucky again
	hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arms around him
	hermione harry  you're a great wizard, you know
	i'm not as good as you, said harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him
	books and cleverness there are more important things  friendship and bravery and  oh harry  be careful you drink first, said harry
	you are sure which is which, aren't you positive, said hermione
	she took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered
	it's not poison said harry anxiously
	no  but it's like ice
	quick, go, before it wears off
	good luck  take care
	go hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire
	harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle
	he turned to face the black flames
	here i come, he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp
	it was indeed as though ice was flooding his body
	he put the bottle down and walked forward he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn't feel them  for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire  then he was on the other side, in the last chamber
	there was already someone there  but it wasn't snape
	it wasn't even voldemort
	chapter seventeen the man with two faces it was quirrell
	his face wasn't twitching at all
	i wondered whether i'd be meeting you here, potter
	but i thought  snape  severus quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp
	yes, severus does seem the type, doesn't he so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat
	next to him, who would suspect pppoor, ststuttering pprofessor quirrell harry couldn't take it in
	this couldn't be true, it couldn't
	but snape tried to kill me no, no, no
	your friend miss granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch match
	she broke my eye contact with you
	another few seconds and i'd have got you off that broom
	i'd have managed it before then if snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you
	snape was trying to save me of course, said quirrell coolly
	why do you think he wanted to referee your next match he was trying to make sure i didn't do it again
	he needn't have bothered
	i couldn't do anything with dumbledore watching
	all the other teachers thought snape was trying to stop gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular
	and what a waste of time, when after all that, i'm going to kill you tonight
	quirrell snapped his fingers
	ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around harry
	you're too nosy to live, potter
	scurrying around the school on halloween like that, for all i knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the stone
	you let the troll in certainly
	i have a special gift with trolls  you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off  and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that threeheaded dog didn't even manage to bite snape's leg off properly
	now, wait quietly, potter
	i need to examine this interesting mirror
	it was only then that harry realized what was standing behind quirrell
	it was the mirror of erised
	this mirror is the key to finding the stone, quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame
	trust dumbledore to come up with something like this
	i'll be far away by the time he gets back
	all harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror
	i saw you and snape in the forest  he blurted out
	yes, said quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back
	he was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far i'd got
	he suspected me all along
	tried to frighten me  as though he could, when i had lord voldemort on my side
	quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it
	i'm presenting it to my master
	but where is it harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give
	he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror
	but snape always seemed to hate me so much
	oh, he does, said quirrell casually, heavens, yes
	he was at hogwarts with your father, didn't you know they loathed each other
	but he never wanted you dead
	but i heard you a few days ago, sobbing  i thought snape was threatening you
	for the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across quirrell's face
	sometimes, he said, i find it hard to follow my master's instructions  he is a great wizard and i am weak  you mean he was there in the classroom with you harry gasped
	he is with me wherever i go, said quirrell quietly
	i met him when i traveled around the world
	a foolish young man i was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil
	lord voldemort showed me how wrong i was
	there is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it
	since then, i have served him faithfully, although i have let him down many times
	he has had to be very hard on me
	quirrell shivered suddenly
	he does not forgive mistakes easily
	when i failed to steal the stone from gringotts, he was most displeased
	decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me
	quirrell's voice trailed away
	harry was remembering his trip to diagon alley how could he have been so stupid he'd seen quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the leaky cauldron
	quirrell cursed under his breath
	is the stone inside the mirror should i break it harry's mind was racing
	what i want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the stone before quirrell does
	so if i look in the mirror, i should see myseff finding it  which means i'll see where it's hidden but how can i look without quirrell realizing what i'm up to he tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight he tripped and fell over
	quirrell ignored him
	he was still talking to himself
	what does this mirror do how does it work help me, master and to harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself use the boy
	quirrell rounded on harry
	yes  potter  come here
	he clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding harry fell off
	harry got slowly to his feet
	come here, quirrell repeated
	look in the mirror and tell me what you see
	harry walked toward him
	i must lie, he thought desperately
	i must look and lie about what i see, that's all
	quirrell moved close behind him
	harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrell's turban
	he closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again
	he saw his reflection, pale and scaredlooking at first
	but a moment later, the reflection smiled at him
	it put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a bloodred stone
	it winked and put the stone back in its pocket  and as it did so, harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket
	somehow  incredibly  he'd gotten the stone
	well said quirrell impatiently
	what do you see harry screwed up his courage
	i see myself shaking hands with dumbledore, he invented
	i  i've won the house cup for gryffindor
	quirrell cursed again
	get out of the way, he said
	as harry moved aside, he felt the sorcerer's stone against his leg
	dare he make a break for it but he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though quirrell wasn't moving his lips
	potter, come back here quirrell shouted
	tell me the truth what did you just see the high voice spoke again
	master, you are not strong enough i have strength enough
	harry felt as if devil's snare was rooting him to the spot
	he couldn't move a muscle
	petrified, he watched as quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban
	what was going on the turban fell away
	quirrell's head looked strangely small without it
	then he turned slowly on the spot
	harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound
	where there should have been a back to quirrell's head, there was a face, the most terrible face harry had ever seen
	it was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake
	harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move
	see what i have become the face said
	mere shadow and vapor
	i have form only when i can share another's body
	but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds
	unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks
	you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the forest
	and once i have the elixir of life, i will be able to create a body of my own
	why don't you give me that stone in your pocket so he knew
	the feeling suddenly surged back into harry's legs
	he stumbled backward
	don't be a fool, snarled the face
	better save your own life and join me
	or you'll meet the same end as your parents
	they died begging me for mercy
	liar harry shouted suddenly
	quirrell was walking backward at him, so that voldemort could still see him
	the evil face was now smiling
	i always value bravery
	yes, boy, your parents were brave
	i killed your father first and he put up a courageous fight
	but your mother needn't have died
	she was trying to protect you
	now give me the stone, unless you want her to have died in vain
	never harry sprang toward the flame door, but voldemort screamed seize him and the next second, harry felt quirrell's hand close on his wrist
	at once, a needlesharp pain seared across harry's scar his head felt as though it was about to split in two he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, quirrell let go of him
	the pain in his head lessened  he looked around wildly to see where quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers  they were blistering before his eyes
	seize him seize him shrieked voldemort again, and quirrell lunged, knocking harry clean off his feet' landing on top of him, both hands around harry's neck  harry's scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see quirrell howling in agony
	master, i cannot hold him  my hands  my hands and quirrell, though pinning harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms  harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny
	then kill him, fool, and be done screeched voldemort
	quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed quirrell's face  aaaargh quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then harry knew quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain  his only chance was to keep hold of quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse
	harry jumped to his feet, caught quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could
	quirrell screamed and tried to throw harry off  the pain in harry's head was building  he couldn't see  he could only hear quirrell's terrible shrieks and voldemort's yells of, kill him kill him and other voices, maybe in harry's own head, crying, harry harry he felt quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down
	something gold was glinting just above him
	the snitch he tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy
	it wasn't the snitch at all
	it was a pair of glasses
	the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above him
	good afternoon, harry, said dumbledore
	then he remembered sir the stone it was quirrell he's got the stone sir, quick  calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times, said dumbledore
	quirrell does not have the stone
	then who does sir, i  harry, please relax, or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out
	harry swallowed and looked around him
	he realized he must be in the hospital wing
	he was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop
	tokens from your friends and admirers, said dumbledore, beaming
	what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows
	i believe your friends misters fred and george weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat
	no doubt they thought it would amuse you
	madam pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it
	how long have i been in here three days
	ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried
	but sit, the stone i see you are not to be distracted
	very well, the stone
	professor quirrell did not manage to take it from you
	i arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, i must say
	you got there you got hermione's owl we must have crossed in midair
	no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that the place i should be was the one i had just left
	i arrived just in time to pull quirrell off you
	i feared i might be too late
	you nearly were, i couldn't have kept him off the stone much longer  not the stone, boy, you  the effort involved nearly killed you
	for one terrible moment there, i was afraid it had
	as for the stone, it has been destroyed
	destroyed said harry blankly
	but your friend  nicolas flamel  oh, you know about nicolas said dumbledore, sounding quite delighted
	you did do the thing properly, didn't you well, nicolas and i have had a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best
	but that means he and his wife will die, won't they they have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die
	dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harry's face
	to one as young as you, i'm sure it seems incredible, but to nicolas and perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day
	after all, to the wellorganized mind, death is but the next great adventure
	you know, the stone was really not such a wonderful thing
	as much money and life as you could want the two things most human beings would choose above all  the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them
	harry lay there, lost for words
	dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling
	sir  even if the stone's gone, vol, i mean, youknow who  call him voldemort, harry
	always use the proper name for things
	fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself
	well, voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't he i mean, he hasn't gone, has he no, harry, he has not
	he is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share
	not being truly alive, he cannot be killed
	he left quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies
	nevertheless, harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time  and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power
	harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt
	then he said, sir, there are some other things i'd like to know, if you can tell me
	things i want to know the truth about
	it is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution
	however, i shall answer your questions unless i have a very good reason not to, in which case i beg you'll forgive me
	i shall not, of course, lie
	voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me
	but why would he want to kill me in the first place dumbledore sighed very deeply this time
	alas, the first thing you ask me, i cannot tell you
	you will know, one day
	put it from your mind for now, harry
	i know you hate to hear this
	when you are ready, you will know
	and harry knew it would be no good to argue
	but why couldn't quirrell touch me your mother died to save you
	if there is one thing voldemort cannot understand, it is love
	he didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark
	not a scar, no visible sign
	to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever
	it is in your very skin
	quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with voldemort, could not touch you for this reason
	it was agony to touch a person marked by something so good
	dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet
	when he had found his voice again, harry said, and the invisibility cloak  do you know who sent it to me ah  your father happened to leave it in my possession, and i thought you might like it
	dumbledore's eyes twinkled
	your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here
	and there's something else
	quirrell said snape  professor snape, harry
	yes, him  quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father
	is that true well, they did rather detest each other
	not unlike yourself and mr
	and then, your father did something snape could never forgive
	what he saved his life
	said dumbledore dreamily
	funny, the way people's minds work, isn't it professor snape couldn't bear being in your father's debt
	i do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even
	then he could go back to hating your father's memory in peace
	harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped
	and sir, there's one more thing
	just the one how did i get the stone out of the mirror ah, now, i'm glad you asked me that
	it was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something
	you see, only one who wanted to find the stone  find it, but not use it  would be able to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life
	my brain surprises even me sometimes
	now, enough questions
	i suggest you make a start on these sweets
	ah bettie bott's every flavor beans i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one, and since then i'm afraid i've rather lost my liking for them  but i think i'll be safe with a nice toffee, don't you he smiled and popped the goldenbrown bean into his mouth
	then he choked and said, alas ear wax madam pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict
	just five minutes, harry pleaded
	you let professor dumbledore in
	well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different
	i am resting, look, lying down and everything
	oh, go on, madam pomfrey
	oh, very well, she said
	but five minutes only
	and she let ron and hermione in
	harry hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore
	oh, harry, we were sure you were going to  dumbledore was so worried  the whole school's talking about it, said ron
	what really happened it was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors
	harry told them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and voldemort
	ron and hermione were a very good audience they gasped in all the right places, and when harry told them what was under quirrell's turban, hermione screamed out loud
	so the stone's gone said ron finally
	flamel's just going to die that's what i said, but dumbledore thinks that  what was it  'to the wellorganized mind, death is but the next great adventure
	i always said he was off his rocker, said ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was
	so what happened to you two said harry
	well, i got back all right, said hermione
	i brought ron round  that took a while  and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall  he already knew  he just said, 'harry's gone after him, hasn't he' and hurtled off to the third floor
	d'you think he meant you to do it said ron
	sending you your father's cloak and everything well,  hermione exploded, if he did  i mean to say that's terrible  you could have been killed
	no, it isn't, said harry thoughtfully
	he's a funny man, dumbledore
	i think he sort of wanted to give me a chance
	i think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know
	i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help
	i don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked
	it's almost like he thought i had the right to face voldemort if i could
	yeah, dumbledore's off his rocker, all right, said ron proudly
	listen, you've got to be up for the endofyear feast tomorrow
	the points are all in and slytherin won, of course  you missed the last quidditch match, we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you  but the food'll be good
	at that moment, madam pomfrey bustled over
	you've had nearly fifteen minutes, now out she said firmly
	after a good night's sleep, harry felt nearly back to normal
	i want to go to the feast, he told madam pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes
	i can, can't i professor dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go, she said stiffily, as though in her opinion professor dumbledore didn't realize how risky feasts could be
	and you have another visitor
	oh, good, said harry
	who is it hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke
	as usual when he was indoors, hagrid looked too big to be allowed
	he sat down next to harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears
	it's  all  my  ruddy  fault he sobbed, his face in his hands
	i told the evil git how ter get past fluffy i told him it was the only thing he didn't know, an' i told him yeh could've died all fer a dragon egg i'll never drink again i should be chucked out an' made ter live as a muggle hagrid said harry, shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard
	hagrid, he'd have found out somehow, this is voldemort we're talking about, he'd have found out even if you hadn't told him
	yeh could've died sobbed hagrid
	an' don' say the name voldemort harry bellowed, and hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying
	i've met him and i'm calling him by his name
	please cheer up, hagrid, we saved the stone, it's gone, he can't use it
	have a chocolate frog, i've got loads
	hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, that reminds me
	i've got yeh a present
	it's not a stoat sandwich, is it said harry anxiously, and at last hagrid gave a weak chuckle
	dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it
	'course, he shoulda sacked me instead  anyway, got yeh this
	it seemed to be a handsome, leathercovered book
	harry opened it curiously
	it was full of wizard photographs
	smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father
	sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer photos
	knew yeh didn' have any
	d'yeh like it harry couldn't speak, but hagrid understood
	harry made his way down to the endofyear feast alone that night
	he had been held up by madam pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the great hall was already full
	it was decked out in the slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate slytherin's winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row
	a huge banner showing the slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the high table
	when harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once
	he slipped into a seat between ron and hermione at the gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him
	fortunately, dumbledore arrived moments later
	the babble died away
	another year gone dumbledore said cheerfully
	and i must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast
	what a year it has been hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were
	you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts
	now, as i understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus in fourth place, gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points in third, hufflepuff, with three hundred and fiftytwo ravenclaw has four hundred and twentysix and slytherin, four hundred and seventy two
	a storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the slytherin table
	harry could see draco malfoy banging his goblet on the table
	it was a sickening sight
	yes, yes, well done, slytherin, said dumbledore
	however, recent events must be taken into account
	the room went very still
	the slytherins' smiles faded a little
	ahem, said dumbledore
	i have a few lastminute points to dish out
	ron went purple in the face he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn
	for the bestplayed game of chess hogwarts has seen in many years, i award gryffindor house fifty points
	gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling the stars overhead seemed to quiver
	percy could be heard telling the other prefects, my brother, you know my youngest brother got past mcgonagall's giant chess set at last there was silence again
	second  to miss hermione granger
	for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, i award gryffindor house fifty points
	hermione buried her face in her arms harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears
	gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves  they were a hundred points up
	the room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage, i award gryffindor house sixty points
	the din was deafening
	those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now had four hundred and seventytwo points  exactly the same as slytherin
	they had tied for the house cup  if only dumbledore had given harry just one more point
	dumbledore raised his hand
	the room gradually fell silent
	there are all kinds of courage, said dumbledore, smiling
	it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends
	i therefore award ten points to mr
	someone standing outside the great hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the gryffindor table
	harry, ron, and hermione stood up to yell and cheer as neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him
	he had never won so much as a point for gryffindor before
	harry, still cheering, nudged ron in the ribs and pointed at malfoy, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the bodybind curse put on him
	which means, dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even ravenclaw and hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of slytherin, we need a little change of decoration
	he clapped his hands
	in an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold the huge slytherin serpent vanished and a towering gryffindor lion took its place
	snape was shaking professor mcgonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile
	he caught harry's eye and harry knew at once that snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot
	this didn't worry harry
	it seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at hogwarts
	it was the best evening of harry's life, better than winning at quidditch, or christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls
	he would never, ever forget tonight
	harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did
	to their great surprise, both he and ron passed with good marks hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years
	even neville scraped through, his good herbology mark making up for his abysmal potions one
	they had hoped that goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too
	it was a shame, but as ron said, you couldn't have everything in life
	and suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, neville's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays i always hope they'll forget to give us these, said fred weasley sadly hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake they were boarding the hogwarts express talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier eating bettie bott's every flavor beans as they sped past muggle towns pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats pulling into platform nine and threequarters at king's cross station
	it took quite a while for them all to get off the platform
	a wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the muggles
	you must come and stay this summer, said ron, both of you  i'll send you an owl
	thanks, said harry, i'll need something to look forward to
	people jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the muggle world
	some of them called bye, harry see you, potter still famous, said ron, grinning at him
	not where i'm going, i promise you, said harry
	he, ron, and hermione passed through the gateway together
	there he is, mom, there he is, look it was ginny weasley, ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at ron
	harry potter she squealed
	look, mom i can see be quiet, ginny, and it's rude to point
	weasley smiled down at them
	thanks for the fudge and the sweater, mrs
	oh, it was nothing, dear
	ready, are you it was uncle vernon, still purplefaced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people
	behind him stood aunt petunia and dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of harry
	you must be harry's family said mrs
	in a manner of speaking, said uncle vernon
	hurry up, boy, we haven't got all day
	harry hung back for a last word with ron and hermione
	see you over the summer, then
	hope you have  er  a good holiday, said hermione, looking uncertainly after uncle vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant
	oh, i will, said harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face
	they don't know we're not allowed to use magic at home
	i'm going to have a lot of fun with dudley this summer

	1c h a p t e ro n ethe worst birthdaynot for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast atnumber four, privet drive
	vernon dursley had been woken inthe early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from hisnephew harry's room
	third time this week he roared across the table
	if you can'tcontrol that owl, it'll have to goharry tried, yet again, to explain
	she's used to flying around outside
	if i couldjust let her out at night do i look stupid snarled uncle vernon, a bit of fried egg danglingfrom his bushy mustache
	i know what'll happen if that owl's letout
	he exchanged dark looks with his wife, petunia
	harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long,loud belch from the dursleys' son, dudley
	there's more in the frying pan, sweetums, said aunt petunia,turning misty eyes on her massive son
	we must build you up whilewe've got the chance
	i don't like the sound of that school food
	nonsense, petunia, i never went hungry when i was at smeltings,said uncle vernon heartily
	dudley gets enough, don't you, sondudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of thekitchen chair, grinned and turned to harry
	you've forgotten the magic word, said harry irritably
	the effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family wasincredible dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash thatshook the whole kitchen mrs
	dursley gave a small scream andclapped her hands to her mouth mr
	dursley jumped to his feet,veins throbbing in his temples
	i meant please' said harry quickly
	i didn't mean what have i told you, thundered his uncle, spraying spitover the table, about saying the m' word in ourhousebut i how dare you threaten dudley roared unclevernon, pounding the table with his fist
	i just i warned you i will not tolerate mention ofyour abnormality under this roofharry stared from his purplefaced uncle to his pale aunt, who wastrying to heave dudley to his feet
	all right, said harry, all right
	uncle vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros andwatching harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes
	ever since harry had come home for the summer holidays, unclevernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at anymoment, because harry potter wasn't a normal boy
	as a matter offact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be
	harry potter was a wizard  a wizard fresh from his first year athogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry
	and if the dursleyswere unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to howharry felt
	he missed hogwarts so much it was like having a constantstomachache
	he missed the castle, with its secret passageways andghosts, his classes though perhaps not snape, the potions master, themail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the great hall, sleeping in hisfourposter bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper,hagrid, in his cabin next to the forbidden forest in the grounds, and,especially, quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding worldsix tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players onbroomsticks
	all harry's spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and topofthelinenimbus two thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboardunder the stairs by uncle vernon the instant harry had come home
	what did the dursleys care if harry lost his place on the housequidditch team because he hadn't practiced all summer what was itto the dursleys if harry went back to school without any of hishomework done the dursleys were what wizards called mugglesnot a drop of magical blood in their veins,and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family wasa matter of deepest shame
	uncle vernon had even padlockedharry's owl, hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carryingmessages to anyone in the wizarding world
	harry looked nothing like the rest of the family
	uncle vernon waslarge and neckless, with an enormous black mustache aunt petuniawas horsefaced and bony dudley was blond, pink, and porky
	harry,on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes andjetblack hair that was always untidy
	he wore round glasses, and onhis forehead was a thin, lightningshaped scar
	it was this scar that made harry so particularly unusual, even for awizard
	this scar was the only hint of harry's very mysterious past, ofthe reason he had been left on the dursleys' doorstep eleven yearsbefore
	at the age of one year old, harry had somehow survived a curse fromthe greatest dark sorcerer of all time, lord voldemort, whose namemost witches and wizards still feared to speak
	harry's parents haddied in voldemort's attack, but harry had escaped with his lightningscar, and somehow  nobody understood why voldemort's powers hadbeen destroyed the instant he had failed to kill harry
	so harry had been brought up by his dead mother's sister and herhusband
	he had spent ten years with the dursleys, neverunderstanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaningto, believing the dursleys' story that he had got his scar in the carcrash that had killed his parents
	and then, exactly a year ago, hogwarts had written to harry,and the whole story had come out
	harry had taken up his place atwizard school, where he and his scar were famous
	but now theschool year was over, and he was back with the dursleys for thesummer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in somethingsmelly
	the dursleys hadn't even remembered that today happened to beharry's twelfth birthday
	of course, his hopes hadn't been high they'dnever given him a real present, let alone a cake  but to ignore itcompletely
	at that moment, uncle vernon cleared his throat importantly and said,now, as we all know, today is a very important day
	harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it
	this could well be the day i make the biggest deal of my career, said uncle vernon
	harry went back to his toast
	of course, he thought bitterly, uncle vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party
	he'd been talking of nothing else for two weeks
	some rich builder and his wifewere coming to dinner and uncle vernon was hoping to get a hugeorder from him uncle vernon's company made drills
	i think we should run through the schedule one more time, saiduncle vernon
	we should all be in position at eight o'clock
	petunia,you will be in the lounge, said aunt petunia promptly, waiting to welcome themgraciously to our home
	and dudleyi'll be waiting to open the door
	dudley put on a foul, simperingsmile
	may i take your coats, mr
	masonthey'll love him cried aunt petunia rapturously
	excellent, dudley, said uncle vernon
	then he rounded on harry
	and youi'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending i'm notthere, said harry tonelessly
	exactly, said uncle vernon nastily
	i will lead them into thelounge, introduce you, petunia, and pour them drinks
	at eightfifteen i'll announce dinner, said aunt petunia
	and, dudley, you'll say may i take you through to the dining room, mrs
	mason saiddudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman
	my perfect little gentleman sniffed aunt petunia
	and you said uncle vernon viciously to harry
	i'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending i'm not there,said harry dully
	now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments atdinner
	petunia, any ideasvernon tells me you're a wonderful golfer, mr
	do tell mewhere you bought your dress, mrs
	dudleyhow about 'we had to write an essay about our hero at school,mr
	mason, and i wrote about you
	'this was too much for both aunt petunia and harry
	aunt petuniaburst into tears and hugged her son, while harry ducked under thetable so they wouldn't see him laughing
	and you, boyharry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged
	i'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending i'm not there,he said
	too right, you will, said uncle vernon forcefully
	the masons don't know anything about you and it's going to stay that way
	when dinner's over, you take mrs
	mason back to the lounge forcoffee, petunia, and i'll bring the subject around to drills
	with anyluck, i'll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten
	be shopping for a vacation home in majorca this time tomorrow
	harry couldn't feel too excited about this
	he didn't think thedursleys would like him any better in majorca than they did onprivet drive
	right  i'm off into town to pick up the dinner jackets fordudley and me
	and you, he snarled at harry
	you stay out ofyour aunt's way while she's cleaning
	harry left through the back door
	it was a brilliant, sunny day
	he crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sangunder his breathhappy birthday to me
	happy birthday to me
	no cards, no presents, and he would be spending the eveningpretending not to exist
	he gazed miserably into the hedge
	he hadnever felt so lonely
	more than anything else at hogwarts, moreeven than playing quidditch, harry missed his best friends, ronweasley and hermione granger
	they, however, didn't seem to bemissing him at all
	neither of them had written to him all summer,even though ron had said he was going to ask harry to come andstay
	countless times, harry had been on the point of unlockinghedwig's cage by magic and sending her to ron and hermionewith a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk
	underage wizards weren'tallowed to use magic outside of school
	harry hadn't told thedursleys this he knew it was only their terror that he might turn themall into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in thecupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick
	for the firstcouple of weeks back, harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense wordsunder his breath and watching dudley tearing out of the room as fastas his fat legs would carry him
	but the long silence from ron andhermione had made harry feel so cut off from the magical world thateven taunting dudley had lost its appeal  and now ron and hermionehad forgotten his birthday
	what wouldn't he give now for a message from hogwarts from anywitch or wizard he'd almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy,draco malfoy, just to be sure it hadn't all been a dream
	not that his whole year at hogwarts had been fun
	at the very end oflast term, harry had come facetoface with none other than lordvoldemort himself
	voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, buthe was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power
	harry had slipped through voldemort's clutches for a second time, butit had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, harry keptwaking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering wherevoldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyesharry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench
	he had beenstaring absentmindedly into the hedge  and the hedge was staring back
	two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves
	harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across thelawn
	i know what day it is, sang dudley, waddling toward him
	the huge eyes blinked and vanished
	what said harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they hadbeen
	i know what day it is, dudley repeated, coming right up to him
	well done, said harry
	so you've finally learned the days of theweek
	today's your birthday, sneered dudley
	how come you haven't gotany cards haven't you even got friends at that freak placebetter not let your mum hear you talking about my school, saidharry coolly
	dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fatbottom
	why're you staring at the hedge he said suspiciously
	i , m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it onfire, said harry
	dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face
	you ccan't  dad told you you're not to do mmagic  he said he'llchuck you out of the house  and you haven't got anywhere else to go you haven't got any friends to take you jiggery pokery said harry in a fierce voice
	hocus pocus squigglywiggly muuuuuum howled dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashedback toward the house
	muuuum he's doing you know whatharry paid dearly for his moment of fun
	as neither dudley northe hedge was in any way hurt, aunt petunia knew he hadn't reallydone magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at hishead with the soapy frying pan
	then she gave him work to do, withthe promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished
	while dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, harrycleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed theflowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the gardenbench
	the sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck
	harryknew he shouldn't have risen to dudley's bait, but dudley had saidthe very thing harry had been thinking himself
	maybe he didn't haveany friends at hogwarts
	wish they could see famous harry potter now, he thought savagely as hespread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat runningdown his face
	it was half past seven ,in the evening when at last, exhausted, heheard aunt petunia calling him
	get in here and walk on the newspaperharry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen
	on top ofthe fridge stood tonight's pudding a huge mound of whipped creamand sugared violets
	a loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven
	eat quickly the masons will be here soon snapped aunt petunia,pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchentable
	she was already wearing a salmonpink cocktail dress
	harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper
	themoment he had finished, aunt petunia whisked away his plate
	upstairs hurryas he passed the door to the living room, harry caught aglimpse of uncle vernon and dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets
	he had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and uncle vernon's furious face appeared at the foot ofthe stairs
	remember, boy  one sound harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside, closedthe door, and turned to collapse on his bed
	the trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it
	c h a p t e rt w odobby's warningharry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing
	the littlecreature on the bed had large, batlike ears and bulging green eyes thesize of tennis balls
	harry knew instantly that this was what had beenwatching him out of the garden hedge that morning
	as they stared at each other, harry heard dudley's voice from the hall
	may i take your coats, mr
	masonthe creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of itslong, thin nose touched the carpet
	harry noticed that it was wearingwhat looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm and legholes
	er  hello, said harry nervously
	harry potter said the creature in a highpitched voice harry wassure would carry down the stairs
	so long has dobby wanted to meetyou, sir
	such an honor it is
	ththank you, said harry, edging along the wall and sinking into hisdesk chair, next to hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage
	hewanted to ask, what are you but thought it would sound too rude,so instead he said, who are youdobby, sir
	dobby the houseelf, said the creature
	oh  really said harry
	er  i don't want to be rude or anything,but  this isn't a great time for me to have a houseelf in mybedroom
	aunt petunias high, false laugh sounded from the living room
	the elfhung his head
	not that i'm not pleased to meet you, said harry quickly, but, er,is there any particular reason you're hereoh, yes, sir, said dobby earnestly
	dobby has come to tell you,sir
	it is difficult, sir
	dobby wonders where to begin
	sit down, said harry politely, pointing at the bed
	to his horror, the elf burst into tears  very noisy tears
	harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter
	i'm sorry, he whispered, i didn't mean to offend you or anything offend dobby choked the elf
	dobby has never been asked to sitdown by a wizard  like an equalharry, trying to say shh and look comforting at the same time,ushered dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, lookinglike a large and very ugly doll
	at last he managed to control himself,and sat with his great eyes fixed on harry in an expression of wateryadoration
	you can't have met many decent wizards, said harry, trying tocheer him up
	then, without warning, he leapt up andstarted banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, baddobby bad dobbydon't  what are you doing harry hissed, springing up and pullingdobby back onto the bed  hedwig had woken up with aparticularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against thebars of her cage
	dobby had to punish himself, sir, said the elf, who had gone slightlycrosseyed
	dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir
	your familythe wizard family dobby serves, sir
	dobby's is a houseelf bound to serve one house and one family forever
	do they know you're here asked harry curiously
	dobby will have to punish himself most grievouslyfor coming to see you, sir
	dobby will have to shut his ears in theoven door for this
	if they ever knew, sir but won't they notice if you shut your ears in the oven doordobby doubts it, sir
	dobby is always having to punish himself forsomething, sir
	they lets dobby get on with it, sir
	sometimes theyreminds me to do extra punishments
	but why don't you leave escapea houseelf must be set free, sir
	and the family will never setdobby free
	dobby will serve the family until he dies, sir
	and i thought i had it bad staying here for another four weeks,he said
	this makes the dursleys sound almost human
	can't anyonehelp you can't ialmost at once, harry wished he hadn't spoken
	dobby dissolved againinto wails of gratitude
	please, harry whispered frantically, please be quiet
	if the dursleyshear anything, if they know you're here harry potter asks if he can help dobby
	dobby has heard of yourgreatness, sir, but of your goodness, dobby never knew
	harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, whateveryou've heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish
	i'm not even topof my year at hogwarts that's hermione, she but he stopped quickly, because thinking about hermione was painful
	itarry potter is humble and modest, said dobby reverently, his orblike eyes aglow
	harry potter speaks not of his triumph over hewhomustnotbenamed voldemort said harry
	dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, ah, speak notthe name, sir speak not the namesorry said harry quickly
	i know lots of people don't like it
	myfriend ron he stopped again
	thinking about ron was painful, too
	dobby leaned toward harry, his eyes wide as headlights
	'dobby heard tell, he said hoarsely, that harry potter met the darklord for a second time just weeks ago
	that harry potter escapedyet again
	harry nodded and dobby's eyes suddenly shone with tears
	,ah, sir, he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubbypillowcase he was wearing
	harry potter is valiant and bold he hasbraved so many dangers already but dobby has come to protectharry potter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears inthe oven door later
	harry potter must notgo back to hogwarts
	there was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forksfrom downstairs and the distant rumble of uncle vernon's voice
	wwhat harry stammered
	but i've got to go back  term startson september first
	it's all that's keeping me going
	you don't knowwhat it's like here
	i belong in your world  athogwarts
	no, no, no, squeaked dobby, shaking his head so hard his earsflapped
	harry potter must stay where he is safe
	he is too great,too good, to lose
	if harry potter goes back to hogwarts, he will bein mortal danger
	why said harry in surprise
	there is a plot, harry potter
	a plot to make most terrible thingshappen at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this year,whispered dobby, suddenly trembling all over
	dobby has known itfor months, sir
	harry potter must not put himself in peril
	he is tooimportant, sirwhat terrible things said harry at once
	who's plotting themdobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his headfrantically against the wall
	all right cried harry, grabbing the elf's arm to stop him
	but why are you warning me a sudden,unpleasant thought struck him
	hang on  this hasn't got anything todo with vol  sorry  with youknowwho, has ityou could just shake or nod, he added hastily as dobby's headtilted worryingly close to the wall again
	slowly, dobby shook his head
	not not he whomustnotbenamed, sir 'but dobby's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to giveharry a hint
	harry, however, was completely lost
	he hasn't got a brother, has hedobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever
	well then, i can't think who else would have a chance of makinghorrible things happen at hogwarts, said harry
	i mean, there'sdumbledore, for one thing  you know who dumbledore is, don'tyoudobby bowed his head
	albus dumbledore is the greatest headmaster hogwarts has everhad
	dobby has heard dumbledore's powersrival those of hewhomustnotbenamed at the height of hisstrength
	but, sir  dobby's voice dropped to an urgent whisper there are powers dumbledore doesn't
	powers no decent wizard
	and before harry could stop him, dobby bounded off the bed,seized harry's desk lamp, and started beating himself around thehead with earsplitting yelps
	a sudden silence fell downstairs
	two seconds later harry, heartthudding madly, heard uncle vernon coming into the hall, calling,dudley must have left his television on again, the little tykequick in the closet hissed harry, stuffing dobby in, shutting thedoor, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned
	what  the  devil  are  you  doing said uncle vernon throughgritted teeth, his face horribly close to harry's
	you've just ruined thepunch line of my japanese golfer joke
	one more sound and you'llwish you'd never been born, boyhe stomped flatfooted from the room
	shaking, harry let dobby out of the closet
	see what it's like here he said
	see why i've got to go back tohogwarts it's the only place i've got well, i think i've got friends
	friends who don't even write to harry potter said dobby slyly
	i expect they've just been  wait a minute, said harry, frowning
	how do you know my friends haven't been writing to medobby shuffled his feet
	harry potter mustn't be angry with dobby
	dobby did it for the best have you been stopping my lettersdobby has them here, sir, said the elf
	stepping nimbly out of harry'sreach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of thepillowcase he was wearing
	harry could make out hermione's neatwriting, ron's untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as thoughit was from the hogwarts gamekeeper, hagrid
	dobby blinked anxiously up at harry
	harry potter mustn't be angry
	if harry potterthought his friends had forgotten him
	harry potter might not want togo back to school, sir
	harry wasn't listening
	he made a grab for the letters, but dobbyjumped out of reach
	harry potter will have them, sir, if he gives dobby his wordthat he will not return to hogwarts
	ah, sir, this is a danger you mustnot face say you won't go back, sirno, said harry angrily
	give me my friends' lettersthen harry potter leaves dobby no choice, said the elf sadly
	before harry could move, dobby had darted to the bedroom door,pulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs
	mouth dry, stomach lurching, harry sprang after him, trying not tomake a sound
	he jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on thehall carpet, looking around for dobby
	from the dining room heheard uncle vernon saying,
	tell petunia that very funny storyabout those american plumbers, mr
	she's been dying tohear
	harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear
	aunt petunia's masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream andsugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling
	on top of acupboard in the corner crouched dobby
	harry potter must say he's not going back to school dobby
	say it, sir i can't dobby gave him a tragic look
	then dobby must do it, sir, for harry potter's own good
	the pudding fell to the floor with a heartstopping crash
	creamsplattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered
	with a cracklike a whip, dobby vanished
	there were screams from the dining room and uncle vernonburst into the kitchen to find harry, rigid with shock, covered from headto foot in aunt petunias pudding
	at first, it looked as though uncle vernon would manage to gloss thewhole thing over
	just our nephew  very disturbed meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs he shooed the shocked masons back into the dining room, promisedharry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the masons had left, and handed him a mop
	aunt petunia dug some icecream out of the freezer and harry, still shaking, started scrubbingthe kitchen clean
	uncle vernon might still have been able to make his deal  if it hadn'tbeen for the owl
	aunt petunia was just passing around a box of afterdinner mints whena huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped aletter on mrs
	mason's head, and swooped out again
	masonscreamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting aboutlunatics
	mason stayed just long enough to tell the dursleys that hiswife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to askwhether this was their idea of a joke
	harry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as unclevernon advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes
	read it he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had delivered
	go on  read itharry took it
	it did not contain birthday greetings
	potter,we have received intelligence that a hover charm was used at yourplace of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine
	as you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spellsoutside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead toexpulsion from said school decree for the reasonable restriction ofunderage sorcery, 1875, paragraph c
	we would also ask you to remember that any magical activity thatrisks notice by members of the nonmagical community muggles isa serious offense under section 13 of the international confederationof warlocks' statute of secrecy
	enjoy your holidays yours sincerely,mafalda hopkirkimproper use of magic officeministry of magicharry looked up from the letter and gulped
	you didn't tell us you weren't allowed to use magic outside school,said uncle vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes
	for got tomention it
	slipped your mind, i daresay
	he was bearing down on harry like a great bulldog, all his teethbared
	well, i've got news for you, boy
	you're never going back to that school
	and if you try andmagic yourself out  they'll expel youand laughing like a maniac, he dragged harry back upstairs
	uncle vernon was as bad as his word
	the following morning,he paid a man to fit bars on harry's window
	he himself fitted a catflap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could bepushed inside three times a day
	they let harry out to use thebathroom morning and evening
	otherwise, he was locked in his roomaround the clock
	three days later, the dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, andharry couldn't see any way out of his situation
	he lay on his bedwatching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wonderedmiserably what was going to happen to him
	what was the good of magicking himself out of his room if hogwartswould expel him for doing it yet life at privet drive had reached analltime low
	now that the dursleys knew they weren't going to wakeup as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon
	dobby might have savedharry from horrible happenings at hogwarts, but the way things weregoing, he'd probably starve to death anyway
	the catflap rattled and aunt petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowlof canned soup into the room
	harry, whose insides were aching withhunger, jumped off his bed and seized it
	the soup was stonecold, buthe drank half of it in one gulp
	then he crossed the room to hedwig'scage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl intoher empty food tray
	she ruffled her feathers and gave him a look ofdeep disgust
	it's no good turning your beak up at it  that's all we've got, saidharry grimly
	he put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the catflap and layback down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had beenbefore the soup
	supposing he was still alive in another four weeks, what would happenif he didn't turn up at hogwarts would someone be sent to see whyhe hadn't come back would they be able to make the dursleys lethim gothe room was growing dark
	exhausted, stomach rumbling, mindspinning over the same unanswerable questions, harry fell into anuneasy sleep
	he dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card readingunderage wizard attached to his cage
	people goggled through the barsat him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw
	he sawdobby's face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but dobbycalled, harry potter is safe there, sir and vanished
	then thedursleys appeared and dudley rattled the bars of the cage, laughing athim
	stop it, harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head
	i'm trying to sleep
	moonlight was shining through the bars on thewindow
	and someone was goggling through the bars at him a frecklefaced, redhaired, longnosed someone
	ron weasley was outside harry's window
	c h a p t e r   t h r e ethe burrowron breathed harry, creeping to the window and pushing it up sothey could talk through the bars
	ron, how did you  what the harry's mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hithim
	ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car,which was parked in midair grinning at harry from the front seatswere fred and george, ron's elder twin brothers
	all right, harry asked george
	what's been going on said ron
	why haven't you been answeringmy letters i've asked you to stay about twelve times, and then dadcame home and said you'd got an official warning for using magic infront of muggles it wasn't me  and how did he knowhe works for the ministry, said ron
	you know we're not supposedto do spells outside school you should talk, said harry, staring at the floating car
	oh, this doesn't count, said ron
	we're only borrowing this
	it'sdad's, we didn't enchant it
	but doing magic in front of those mugglesyou live with i told you, i didn't  but it'll take too long to explain now look, can youtell them at hogwarts that the dursleys have locked me up and won'tlet me come back, and obviously i can't magic myself out, because theministry'il think that's the second spell i've done in three days, so stop gibbering, said ron
	we've come to take you home with us
	but you can't magic me out either we don't need to, said ron, jerking his head toward the front seatand grinning
	you forget who i've got with me
	tie that around the bars, said fred, throwing the end of a rope toharry
	if the dursleys wake up, i'm dead, said harry as he tied the ropetightly around a bar and fred revved up the car
	don't worry, said fred, and stand back
	harry moved back into the shadows next to hedwig, who seemed tohave realized how important this was and kept still and silent
	the carrevved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, thebars were pulled clean out of the window as fred drove straight up inthe air
	harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a fewfeet above the ground
	panting, ron hoisted them up into the car
	harry listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the dursleys'bedroom
	when the bars were safely in the back seat with ron, fred reversedas close as possible to harry's window
	but all my hogwarts stuff  my wand  my broomstick where is itlocked in the cupboard under the stairs, and i can't get out of thisroom no problem, said george from the front passenger seat
	out ofthe way, harry
	fred and george climbed catlike through the window into harry'sroom
	you had to hand it to them, thought harry, as george took anordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock
	a lot of wizards think it's a waste of time, knowing this sort ofmuggle trick, said fred, but we feel they're skills worth learning,even if they are a bit slow
	there was a small click and the door swung open
	so  we'll get your trunk  you grab anything you need from yourroom and hand it out to ron, whispered george
	watch out for the bottom stair  it creaks, harry whispered backas the twins disappeared onto the dark landing
	harry dashed around his room, collecting his things and passing themout of the window to ron
	then he went to help fred and georgeheave his trunk up the stairs
	harry heard uncle vernon cough
	at last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunkthrough harry's room to the open window
	fred climbed back intothe car to pull with ron, and harry and george pushed from thebedroom side
	inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window
	uncle vernon coughed again
	a bit more, panted fred, who was pulling from inside the car
	one good push harry and george threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slidout of the window into the back seat of the car
	okay, let's go, george whispered
	but as harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loudscreech from behind him, followed immediately by the thunder ofuncle vernon's voice
	that ruddy owli've forgotten hedwigharry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on  hesnatched up hedwig's cage, dashed to the window, and passed itout to ron
	he was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers whenuncle vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open
	for a split second, uncle vernon stood framed in the doorway thenhe let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at harry, grabbinghim by the ankle
	ron, fred, and george seized harry's arms and pulled as hard asthey could
	petunia roared uncle vernon
	he's getting away he'sgetting awaybut the weasleys gave a gigantic tug and harry's leg slid out ofuncle vernon's grasp  harry was in the car  he'd slammed thedoor shutput your foot down, fred yelled ron, and the car shot suddenlytoward the moon
	harry couldn't believe it  he was free
	he rolled down thewindow, the night air whipping his hair, and looked back at theshrinking rooftops of privet drive
	uncle vernon, aunt petunia, anddudley were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of harry's window
	see you next summer harry yelled
	the weasleys roared with laughter and harry settled back in his seat,grinning from ear to ear
	let hedwig out, he told ron
	she can fly behind us
	she hasn't hada chance to stretch her wings for ages
	george handed the hairpin to ron and, a moment later, hedwig soaredjoyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost
	so  what's the story, harry said ron impatiently
	what's beenhappeningharry told them all about dobby, the warning he'd given harry andthe fiasco of the violet pudding
	there was a long, shocked silencewhen he had finished
	very fishy, said fred finally
	definitely dodgy agreed george
	so he wouldn't even tell you who'ssupposed to be plotting all this stuffi don't think he could, said harry
	i told you, every time he got closeto letting something slip, he started banging his head against the wall
	he saw fred and george look at each other
	what, you think he was lying to me said harry
	well, said fred, put it this way  houseelves have got powerfulmagic of their own, but they can't usually use it without their master'spermission
	i reckon old dobby was sent to stop you coming back to hogwarts
	someone's idea of a joke
	can you think ofanyone at school with a grudge against youyes, said harry and ron together, instantly
	draco malfoy, harry explained
	draco malfoy said george, turning around
	not lucius malfoy'ssonmust be, it's not a very common name, is it said harry
	i've heard dad talking about him, said george
	he was a bigsupporter of youknowwho
	and when youknowwho disappeared, said fred, craningaround to look at harry, lucius malfoy came back saying he'd nevermeant any of it
	load of dung  dad reckons he was right in youknowwho's inner circle
	harry had heard these rumors about malfoy's family before, and theydidn't surprise him at all
	malfoy made dudley dursley look like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy
	i don't know whether the malfoys own a houseelf
	well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and they'llbe rich, said fred
	yeah, mum's always wishing we had a houseelf to do the ironing,said george
	but all we've got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic andgnomes all over the garden
	houseelves come with big old manorsand castles and places like that you wouldn't catch one in our house
	judging by the fact that draco malfoy usually hadthe best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold hecould just see malfoy strutting around a large manor house
	sendingthe family servant to stop harry from going back to hogwarts alsosounded exactly like the sort of thing malfoy would do
	had harrybeen stupid to take dobby seriouslyi'm glad we came to get you, anyway, said ron
	i was gettingreally worried when you didn't answer any of my letters
	i thought itwas errol's fault at firstwho's errolour owl
	it wouldn't be the first time he'd collapsedon a delivery
	so then i tried to borrow hermes whothe owl mum and dad bought percy when he was made prefect,said fred from the front
	but percy wouldn't lend him to me, said ron
	percy's been acting very oddly this summer, said george,frowning
	and he has been sending a lot of letters and spending aload of time shut up in his room
	i mean, there's only so manytimes you can polish a prefect badge
	you're driving too far west,fred, he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard
	fredtwiddled the steering wheel
	so, does your dad know you've got the car said harry, guessingthe answer
	er, no, said ron, he had to work tonight
	hopefully we'll be ableto get it back in the garage without mum noticing we flew it
	what does your dad do at the ministry of magic, anywayhe works in the most boring department, said ron
	the misuseof muggle artifacts office
	the whatit's all to do with bewitching things that are mugglemade, youknow, in case they end up back in a muggle shop or house
	like,last year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiquesshop
	this muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried to serveher friends tea in it
	it was a nightmare  dad was working overtimefor weeks
	what happenedthe teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the placeand one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clampedto his nose
	dad was going frantic  it's only him and an old warlockcalled perkins in the office and they had to do memory charms andall sorts of stuff to cover it up but your dad  this car fred laughed
	yeah, dad's crazy about everything to do withmuggles our shed's full of muggle stuff
	he takes it apart, puts spellson it, and puts it back together again
	if he raided our house he'dhave to put himself under arrest
	that's the main road, said george, peering down through thewindshield
	we'll be there in ten minutes
	just as well, it's gettinglight
	a faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east
	fred brought the car lower, and harry saw a dark patchwork offields and clumps of trees
	we're a little way outside the village, said george
	lower and lower went the flying car
	the edge of a brilliant red sunwas now gleaming through the trees
	touchdown said fred as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground
	they had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, andharry looked out for the first time at ron's house
	it looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extrarooms had been added here and there until it was several stories highand so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic which,harry reminded himself, it probably was
	four or five chimneys wereperched on top of the red roof
	a lopsided sign stuck in the groundnear the entrance read, the burrow
	around the front door lay a jumbleof rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron
	several fat brown chickenswere pecking their way around the yard
	it's not much, said ron
	it's wonderful, said harry happily, thinking of privet drive
	they got out of the car
	now, we'll go upstairs really quietly, said fred, and wait for mum tocall us for breakfast then, ron, you come bounding downstairs going,mum, look who turned up in the night' and she'll be all pleased to seeharry and no one need ever know we flew the car
	come on, harry, i sleep at the  at the topron had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on the house
	theother three wheeled around
	weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, andfor a short, plump, kindfaced woman, it was remarkable how muchshe looked like a sabertoothed tiger
	oh, dear, said george
	weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her hips,staring from one guilty face to the next
	she was wearing a floweredapron with a wand sticking out of the pocket
	morning, mum, said george, in what he clearly thought was a jaunty,winning voice
	have you any idea how worried i've been said mrs
	weasley in adeadly whisper
	sorry, mum, but see, we had to all three of mrs
	weasley's sons were taller than she was, but theycowered as her rage broke over them
	beds empty no note cargone  could have crashed  out of mymind with worry  did you care  never, as long as i've lived you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like thisfrom bill or charlie or percy perfect percy, muttered fred
	you could do with taking a leaf out of percy'sbook yelled mrs
	weasley, prodding a finger in fred's chest
	youcould have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost yourfather his job it seemed to go on for hours
	weasley had shouted herselfhoarse before she turned on harry, who backed away
	i'm very pleased to see you, harry, dear, she said
	come in andhave some breakfast
	she turned and walked back into the house and harry, after a nervousglance at ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her
	the kitchen was small and rather cramped
	there was ascrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and harry sat downon the edge of his seat, looking around
	he had never been in a wizardhouse before
	the clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbersat all
	written around the edge were things like time to make tea, timeto feed the chickens, and you're late
	books were stacked three deep onthe mantelpiece, books with titles like charm your own cheese,enchantment in baking, and one minute feasts  it's magic and unlessharry's ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had justannounced that coming up was witching hour, with the popularsinging sorceress, celestina warbeck
	weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a littlehaphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausagesinto the frying pan
	every now and then she muttered things like don'tknow what you were thinking of, and never would have believed it
	i don't blame you, dear, she assured harry, tipping eight or ninesausages onto his plate
	arthur and i have been worried about you,too
	just last night we were saying we'd come and get you ourselves ifyou hadn't written back to ron by friday
	but really, she was nowadding three fried eggs to his plate flying an illegal car halfwayacross the country  anyone could have seen you she flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began toclean themselves, clinking gently in the background
	it was cloudy, mum said fred
	you keep your mouth closed while you're eating mrs
	they were starving him, mum said george
	weasley, but it was with a slightly softenedexpression that she started cutting harry bread and buttering it forhim
	at that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small,redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen,gave a small squeal, and ran out again
	ginny, said ron in an undertone to harry
	she's beentalking about you all summer
	yeah, she'll be wanting your autograph, harry, fred said with a grin,but he caught his mother's eye and bent his face over his plate withoutanother word
	nothing more was said until all four plates were clean,which took a surprisingly short time
	blimey, i'm tired, yawned fred, setting down his knife and fork at last
	i think i'll go to bed and you will not, snapped mrs
	it's your own fault you'vebeen up all night
	you're going to degnome the garden for me they'regetting completely out of hand again oh, mum and you two, she said, glaring at ron and fred
	you can go up tobed, dear, she added to harry
	you didn't ask them to fly thatwretched car but harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, i'll help ron
	i'venever seen a degnoming that's very sweet of you, dear, but it's dull work, said mrs
	now, let's see what lockhart's got to say on the subject and she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece
	mum, we know how to degnome a garden harry looked at the cover of mrs
	written across itin fancy gold letters were the words gilderoy lockhart's guide tohousehold pests
	there was a big photograph on the front of a very goodioiking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes
	as alwaysin the wizarding world, the photograph was moving the wizard, whoharry supposed was gilderoy lockhart, kept winking cheekily up atthem all
	weasley beamed down at him
	oh, he is marvelous, she said
	he knows his household pests, allright, it's a wonderful book
	mum fancies him, said fred, in a very audible whisper
	don't be so ridiculous, fred, said mrs
	weasley, her cheeks ratherpink
	all right, if you think you know better than lockhart, you can goand get on with it, and woe betide you if there's a single gnome in thatgarden when i come out to inspect it
	yawning and grumbling, the weasleys slouched outside with harrybehind them
	the garden was large, and in harry's eyes, exactlywhat a garden should be
	the dursleys wouldn't have liked it  therewere plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting but there weregnarled trees all around the walls, plants harry had never seen spillingfrom every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs
	muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know, harry told ron asthey crossed the lawn
	yeah, i've seen those things they think are gnomes, said ron, bentdouble with his head in a peony bush, like fat little santa clauses withfishing rods
	there was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, andron straightened up
	this is a gnome, he said grimly
	gerroff me gerroff me squealed the gnome
	it was certainly nothing like santa claus
	it was small and leatherylooking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato
	ron heldit at arm's length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet hegrasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down
	this is what you have to do, he said
	he raised the gnome above hishead gerroff me and started to swing it in great circles like alasso
	seeing the shocked look on harry's face, ron added, it doesn'thurt them  you've just got to make them really dizzy so they can't findtheir way back to the gnomeholes
	he let go of the gnome's ankles it flew twenty feet into the air andlanded with a thud in the field over the hedge
	i bet i can get mine beyond that stump
	harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes
	he decidedjust to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome,sensing weakness, sank its razorsharp teeth into harry's finger and hehad a hard job shaking it off  untilwow, harry  that must've been fifty feet
	the air was soon thick with flying gnomes
	see, they're not too bright, said george, seizing five or six gnomes atonce
	the moment they know the degnoming's going on they stormup to have a look
	you'd think they'd have learned by now just to stayput
	soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in astraggling line, their little shoulders hunched
	they'll be back, said ron as they watched the gnomes disappear intothe hedge on the other side of the field
	dad'stoo soft with them he thinks they're funny
	just then, the front door slammed
	he's back said george
	dad's homethey hurried through the garden and back into the house
	weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off andhis eyes closed
	he was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair hehad was as red as any of his children's
	he was wearing long greenrobes, which were dusty and travelworn
	what a night, he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all satdown around him
	nine and old mundungus fletchertried to put a hex on me when i had my back turned
	weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed
	find anything, dad said fred eagerly
	all i got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle, yawnedmr
	there was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn't mydepartment, though
	mortlake was taken away for questioning aboutsome extremely odd ferrets, but that's the committee on experimentalcharms, thank goodness
	why would anyone bother making door keys shrink said george
	just mugglebaiting, sighed mr
	sell them a key thatkeeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it
	of course, it's very hard to convict anyone because no mugglewould admit their key keeps shrinking  they'll insist they just keeplosing it
	bless them, they'll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even ifit's staring them in the face
	but the things our lot have taken toenchanting, you wouldn't believe like cars, for instancemrs
	weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword
	weasley's eyes jerked open
	he stared guiltily at his wife
	ccars, molly, dearyes, arthur, cars, said mrs
	weasley, her eyes flashing
	imagine awizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to dowith it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he wasenchanting it to make it fly
	well, dear, i think you'll find that he would be quite within the law todo that, even if  er  he maybe would have done better to, um, tell hiswife the truth
	there's a loophole in the law, you'll find
	as longas he wasn't intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could flywouldn't arthur weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when youwrote that law shouted mrs
	just so you could carry ontinkering with all that muggle rubbish in your shed and for yourinformation, harry arrived this morning in the car you weren'tintending to flyharry said mr
	harry whohe looked around, saw harry, and jumped
	good lord, is it harry potter very pleased to meet you, ron's told usso much about your sons flew that car to harry's house and back last night
	what have you got to say about that, ehdid you really said mr
	did it go all right i  imean, he faltered as sparks flew from mrs
	weasley's eyes, that that was very wrong, boys  very wrong indeed
	let's leave them to it, ron muttered to harry as mrs
	weasleyswelled like a bullfrog
	come on, i'll show you my bedroom
	they slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to anuneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging upthrough the house
	on the third landing, a door stood ajar
	harry justcaught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before itclosed with a snap
	you don't know how weird it is for her to be thisshy
	she never shuts up normally they climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peelingpaint and a small plaque on it, saying ronald's room
	harry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, andblinked
	it was like walking into a furnace nearly everything in ron'sroom seemed to be a violent shade of orange the bedspread, thewalls, even the ceiling
	then harry realized that ron had coverednearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the sameseven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carryingbroomsticks, and waving energetically
	your quidditch team said harry
	the chudley cannons, said ron, pointing at the orange bedspread,which was emblazoned with two giant black c's and a speedingcannonball
	ron's school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to apile of comics that all seemed to feature the adventures of martinmiggs, the mad muggle
	ron's magic wand was lying on top of a fishtank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat,scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun
	harry stepped over a pack of selfshuffling playing cards on the floorand looked out of the tiny window
	in the field far below he could seea gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the weasleys'hedge
	then he turned to look at ron, who was watching him almostnervously, as though waiting for his opinion
	it's a bit small, said ron quickly
	not like that room you hadwith the muggles
	and i'm right underneath the ghoul in the attiche's always banging on the pipes and groaning
	but harry, grinning widely, said, this is the best house i've everbeen in
	c h a p t e r  f o u rat fl0urish and blottslife at the burrow was as different as possible from life on privetdrive
	the dursleys liked everything neat and ordered the weasleys'house burst with the strange and unexpected
	harry got a shock thefirst time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and itshouted, tuck your shirt in, scruffy the ghoul in the attic howledand dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, andsmall explosions from fred and george's bedroom were consideredperfectly normal
	what harry found most unusual about life at ron's,however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul it was thefact that everybody there seemed to like him
	weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force himto eat fourth helpings at every meal
	weasley liked harry to sitnext to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him withquestions about life with muggles, asking him to explain how thingslike plugs and the postal service worked
	he would say as harry talked him through using atelephone
	ingenious, really, how many ways muggles have found ofgetting along without magic
	harry heard from hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after hehad arrived at the burrow
	he and ron went down to breakfast to findmr
	weasley and ginny already sitting at the kitchen table
	the moment she saw harry, ginny accidentally knocked her porridgebowl to the floor with a loud clatter
	ginny seemed very prone toknocking things over whenever harry entered a room
	she dived underthe table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing likethe setting sun
	pretending he hadn't noticed this, harry sat down andtook the toast mrs
	letters from school, said mr
	weasley, passing harry and ronidentical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink
	dumbledore already knows you're here, harry  doesn't miss a trick,that man
	you two've got them, too, he added, as fred and georgeambled in, still in their pajamas
	for a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters
	harry's told him to catch the hogwarts express as usual from king'scross station on september first
	there was also a list of the newbooks he'd need for the coming year
	secondyear students will requirethe standard book of spells, grade 2by miranda goshawkbreak with a banshee by gilderoy lockhartgadding with ghouls by gilderoy lockhartholidays with hags by gilderoy lockharttravels with trolls by gilderoy lockhartvoyages with vampires by gilderoy lockhartwanderings with werewolves by gilderoy lockhartyear with the yeti by gilderoy lockhartfred, who had finished his own list, peered over at harry's
	you've been told to get all lockhart's books, too he said
	the newdefense against the dark arts teacher must be a fan  bet it's awitch
	at this point, fred caught his mother's eye and quickly busied himselfwith the marmalade
	that lot won't come cheap, said george, with a quick look at hisparents
	lockhart's books are really expensive
	well, we'll manage, said mrs
	weasley, but she looked worried
	iexpect we'll be able to pick up a lot of ginny's things secondhand
	oh, are you starting at hogwarts this year harry asked ginny
	she nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put herelbow in the butter dish
	fortunately no one saw this except harry,because just then ron's elder brother percy walked in
	he wasalready dressed, his hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweatervest
	morning, all, said percy briskly
	he sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almostimmediately, pulling from underneath him a moulting, gray featherduster  at least, that was what harry thought it was, until he saw thatit was breathing
	errol said ron, taking the limp owl from percy and extracting aletter from under its wing
	finally  he's got hermione's answer
	iwrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from thedursleys
	he carried errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried tostand him on it, but errol flopped straight off again so ron lay him onthe draining board instead, muttering, pathetic
	then he rippedopen hermione's letter and read it out louddear ron, and harry if you're there,i hope everything went all right and that harry is okay and thatyou didn't do anything illegal to get him out, ron, because that wouldget harry into trouble, too
	i've been really worried and if harry is allright, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl because i think another delivery mightfinish your one off
	'i'm very busy with schoolwork, of course' how can she be said ronin horror
	we're on vacation  'and we're going to london nextwednesday to buy my new books
	why don't we meet in diago n alleylet me know what's happening as soon as you can
	well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,said mrs
	weasley, starting to clear the table
	what're you all up totodayharry, ron, fred, and george were planning to go up the hill to asmall paddock the weasleys owned
	it was surrounded by trees thatblocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they couldpractice quidditch there, as long as they didn't fly too high
	they couldn't use real quidditch balls, which would have been hard toexplain if they had escaped and flown away over the village insteadthey threw apples for one another to catch
	they took turns ridingharry's nimbus two thousand, which was easily the best broomron's old shooting star was often outstripped by passing butterflies
	five minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks overtheir shoulders
	they had asked percy if he wanted to join them, buthe had said he was busy
	harry had only seen percy at mealtimes sofar he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time
	wish i knew what he was up to, said fred, frowning
	his exam results came the day before you did twelveo
	s and he hardly gloated at all
	ordinary wizarding levels, george explained, seeing harry'spuzzled look
	bill got twelve, too
	if we're not careful, we'll haveanother head boy in the family
	i don't think i could stand the shame
	bill was the oldest weasley brother
	he and the next brother, charlie,had already left hogwarts
	harry had never met either of them, butknew that charlie was in romania studying dragons and bill in egyptworking for the wizard's bank, gringotts
	dunno how mum and dad are going to afford all our school stuff thisyear, said george after a while
	five sets of lockhart books andginny needs robes and a wand and everything
	he felt a bit awkward
	stored in an undergroundvault at gringotts in london was a small fortune that his parents hadleft him
	of course, it was only in the wizarding world that he hadmoney you couldn't use galleons, sickles, and knutsin muggle shops
	he had never mentioned his gringotts bank accountto the dursleys he didn't think their horror of anything connected withmagic would stretch to a large pile of gold
	weasley woke them all early the following wednesday
	after aquick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coatsand mrs
	weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece andpeered inside
	we're running low, arthur, she sighed
	we'll have to buy somemore today
	ah well, guests first after you, harry dearand she offered him the flowerpot
	harry stared at them all watching him
	wwhat am i supposed to do he stammered
	he's never traveled by floo powder, said ron suddenly
	sorry,harry, i forgot
	but how did you get to diagon alley tobuy your school things last yeari went on the underground really said mr
	were there escapators howexactly not now, arthur, said mrs
	floo powder's a lot quicker,dear, but goodness me, if you've never used it before he'll be all right, mum, said fred
	harry, watch us first
	he took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped upto the fire, and threw the powder into the flames
	with a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than fred,who stepped right into it, shouted, diagon alley and vanished
	you must speak clearly, dear, mrs
	weasley told harry as georgedipped his hand into the flowerpot
	and be sure to get out at the rightgrate
	the right what said harry nervously as the fire roared and whippedgeorge out of sight, too
	well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know,but as long as you've spoken clearly he'll be fine, molly, don't fuss, said mr
	weasley, helping himself tofloo powder, too
	but, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt andunclethey wouldn't mind, harry reassured her
	dudley would think itwas a brilliant joke if i got lost up a chimney, don't worry about that well
	you go after arthur, said mrs
	now,when you get into the fire, say where you're goingand keep your elbows tucked in, ron advised
	and your eyes shut, said mrs
	the soot don't fidget, said ron
	or you might well fall out of the wrongfireplace but don't panic and get out too early wait until you see fred andgeorge
	trying hard to bear all this in mind, harry took a pinch of floo powderand walked to the edge of the fire
	he took a deep breath, scatteredthe powder into the flames, and stepped forward the fire felt like awarm breeze he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lotof hot ash
	ddiagon alley, he coughed
	it felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain
	he seemedto be spinning very fast  the roaring in his ears was deafening hetried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made himfeel sick  something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it intightly, still spinning and spinning  now it felt as though cold handswere slapping his face  squinting through his glasses he saw a blurredstream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond  hisbacon sandwiches were churning inside him  he closed his eyes againwishing it would stop, and thenhe fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glassessnap
	dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holdinghis broken glasses up to his eyes
	he was ,cite alone, but where hewas, he had no idea
	all he could tell was that he was standing in thestone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard's shop  butnothing in here was ever likely to be on a hogwarts school list
	a glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstainedpack of cards, and a staring glass eye
	evillooking masks stared downfrom the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter,and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling
	even worse, thedark, narrow street harry could see through the dusty shop windowwas definitely not diagon alley
	the sooner he got out of here, the better
	nose still stinging where ithad hit the hearth, harry made his way swiftly and silently toward thedoor, but before he'd got halfway toward it, two people appeared onthe other side of the glass  and one of them was the very last person harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered insoot, and wearing broken glasses draco malfoy
	harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to hisleft he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crackto peer through
	seconds later, a bell clanged, and malfoy stepped intothe shop
	the man who followed could only be draco's father
	he had the samepale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes
	malfoy crossedthe shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on thecounter before turning to his son and saying, touch nothing, draco
	malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, i thought you weregoing to buy me a present
	i said i would buy you a racing broom, said his father, drumming hisfingers on the counter
	what's the good of that if i'm not on the house team said malfoy,looking sulky and badtempered
	harry potter got a nimbus twothousand last year
	special permission from dumbledore so he couldplay for gryffindor
	he's not even that good, it's just because he'sfamous
	famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead
	malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls
	everyone thinks he's so smart, wonderful potter with his scar andhis broomstick you have told me this at least a dozen times already, said mr
	malfoy, with a quelling look at his son
	and i would remind you that itis not  prudent  to appear less than fond of harry potter, not whenmost of our kind regard him as the hero who made the dark lorddisappear  ah, mr
	a stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing hisgreasy hair back from his face
	malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again, said mr
	borgin in avoice as oily as his hair
	delighted  and young master malfoy, too charmed
	how may i be of assistance i must show you, just in today,and very reasonably priced i'm not buying today, mr
	borgin, but selling, said mr
	selling the smile faded slightly from mr
	you have heard, of course, that the ministry is conducting moreraids, said mr
	malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his insidepocket and unraveling it for mr
	i have a few  ah items at home that might embarrass me, if the ministry were to call
	borgin fixed a pair of pincenez to his nose and looked down thelist
	the ministry wouldn't presume to trouble you, sir, surelymr
	i have not been visited yet
	the name malfoy still commands acertain respect, yet the ministry grows ever more meddlesome
	thereare rumors about a new muggle protection act  no doubt that fleabitten, muggleloving fool arthur weasley is behind itharry felt a hot surge of anger
	and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear i understand, sir, of course, said mr
	can i have that interrupted draco, pointing at the withered hand onits cushion
	ah, the hand of glory said mr
	borgin, abandoning mr
	malfoy'slist and scurrying over to draco
	insert a candle and it gives light onlyto the holder best friend of thieves and plunderers your son has finetaste, sir
	i hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer,borgin, said mr
	malfoy coldly, and mr
	borgin said quickly, nooffense, sir, no offense meant though if his grades don't pick up, said mr
	malfoy, more coldly still,that may indeed be all he is fit for it's not my fault, retorted draco
	the teachers all have favorites,that hermione granger i would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard familybeat you in every exam, snapped mr
	ha said harry under his breath, pleased to see draco looking bothabashed and angry
	it's the same all over, said mr
	borgin, in his oily voice
	wizardblood is counting for less everywhere not with me, said mr
	malfoy, his long nostrils flaring
	no, sir, nor with me, sir, said mr
	borgin, with a deep bow
	in that case, perhaps we can return to my list, said mr
	i am in something of a hurry, borgin, i have importantbusiness elsewhere today they started to haggle
	harry watched nervously as draco drewnearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale
	draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman's rope and to read,smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals,caution do not touch
	cursed  has claimed the lives of nineteen muggleowners to date
	draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him
	hewalked forward  he stretched out his hand for the handledone, said mr
	malfoy at the counter
	come, draco harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as draco turned away
	i'll expect you at the manor tomorrowto pick up the goods
	the moment the door had closed, mr
	borgin dropped his oily manner
	good day yourself, mister malfoy, and if the stories are true, youhaven't sold me half of what's hidden in your manor
	borgin disappeared into a back room
	harrywaited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could,slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shopdoor
	clutching his broken glasses to his face, harry stared around
	he hademerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely ofshops devoted to the dark arts
	the one he'd just left, borgin andburkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty windowdisplay of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage wasalive with gigantic black spiders
	two shabbylooking wizards werewatching him from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other
	feeling jumpy, harry set off, trying to hold his glasses on straight andhoping against hope he'd be able to find a way out of here
	an old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonouscandles told him he was in knockturn alley
	this didn't help, as harryhad never heard of such a place
	he supposed he hadn't spokenclearly enough through his mouthful of ashesback in the weasleys' fire
	trying to stay calm, he wondered what todo
	not lost are you, my dear said a voice in his ear, making him jump
	an aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what lookedhorribly like whole human fingernails
	she leered at him, showingmossy teeth
	i'm fine, thanks, he said
	i'm just harry what d'yeh think yer doin' down thereharry's heart leapt
	so did the witch a load of fingernails cascadeddown over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of hagrid, thehogwarts gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetleblack eyesflashing over his great bristling beard
	hagrid harry croaked in relief
	i was lost  floo powder hagrid seized harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him awayfrom the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands
	her shrieksfollowed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into brightsunlight
	harry saw a familiar, snowwhite marble building in thedistance  gringotts bank
	hagrid had steered him right into diagonalley
	yer a mess said hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off harry soforcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outsidean apothecary
	skulkin' around knockturn alley, i dunno dodgy place,harry  don' want no one ter see yeh down there i realized that, said harry, ducking as hagrid made to brush him offagain
	i told you, i was lost  what were you doing down there,anywayi was lookin' fer a flesheatin' slug repellent, growled hagrid
	they're ruinin' the school cabbages
	yer not on yer owni'm staying with the weasleys but we got separated, harry explained
	i've got to go and find them
	they set off together down the street
	how come yeh never wrote back ter me said hagrid as harryjogged alongside him he had to take three steps to every stride ofhagrid's enormous boots
	harry explained all about dobby and thedursleys
	lousy muggles, growled hagrid
	if i'd've known harry harry over hereharry looked up and saw hermione granger standing at the top of thewhite flight of steps to gringotts
	she ran down to meet them, herbushy brown hair flying behind her
	what happened to your glasses hello, hagrid  oh, it's wonderful tosee you two again  are you coming into gringotts, harryas soon as i've found the weasleys, said harry
	yeh won't have long ter wait, hagrid said with a grin
	harry and hermione looked around sprinting up the crowded streetwere ron, fred, george, percy, and mr
	we hoped you'd only gone one grate too far
	he mopped his glistening bald patch
	molly'sfrantic  she's coming now where did you come out ron asked
	knockturn alley, said hagrid grimly
	said fred and george together
	we've never been allowed in, said ron enviously
	i should ruddy well think not, growled hagrid
	weasley now came galloping into view, her handbag swinging wildly in one hand, ginny just clinging onto the other
	oh, harry  oh, my dear  you could have been anywhere gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of herbag and began sweeping off the soot hagrid hadn't managed tobeat away
	weasley took harry's glasses, gave them a tap of hiswand, and returned them, good as new
	well, gotta be off, said hagrid, who was having his handwrung by mrs
	weasley knockturn alley if you hadn't foundhim, hagrid
	see yer at hogwarts and he strode away, headand shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street
	guess who i saw in borgin and burkes harry asked ron andhermione as they climbed the gringotts steps
	malfoy and his father
	did lucius malfoy buy anything said mr
	weasley sharplybehind them
	no, he was selling 'so he's worried, said mr
	weasley with grim satisfaction
	oh,i'd love to get lucius malfoy for something
	you be careful, arthur, said mrs
	weasley sharply as they werebowed into the bank by a goblin at the door
	that family's trouble
	don't go biting off more than you can chew so you don't think i'm a match for lucius malfoy said mr
	weasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by thesight of hermione's parents, who were standing nervously at thecounter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting forhermione to introduce them
	but you're muggles said mr
	we must have a drinkwhat's that you've got there oh, you're changing muggle money
	molly,look he pointed excitedly at the tenpound notes in mr
	meet you back here, ron said to hermione as the weasleys and harrywere led off to their underground vaults by another gringotts goblin
	the vaults were reached by means of small, goblindriven carts that spedalong miniature train tracks through the bank's underground tunnels
	harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the weasleys' vault, but feltdreadful, far worse than he had in knockturn alley, when it was opened
	there was a very small pile of silver sickles inside, and just one gold galleon
	weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot intoher bag
	harry felt even worse when they reached his vault
	he tried toblock the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into aleather bag
	back outside on the marble steps, they all separated
	percy mutteredvaguely about needing a new quill
	fred and george had spotted theirfriend from hogwarts, lee jordan
	weasley and ginny were going toa secondhand robe shop
	weasley was insisting on taking the grangersoff to the leaky cauldron for a drink
	we'll all meet at flourish and blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks,said mrs
	weasley, setting off with ginny
	and not one step downknockturn alley she shouted at the twins' retreating backs
	harry, ron, and hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled street
	the bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfullyin harry's pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought threelarge strawberryandpeanutbutter ice creams, which they slurpedhappily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinatingshop windows
	ron gazed longingly at a full set of chudley cannon robes in the windows of quality quidditch supplies untilhermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door
	in gambol and japes wizarding joke shop, they met fred, george,and lee jordan, who were stocking up on dr
	filibuster's fabulouswetstart, noheat fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potionstains they found percy, deeply immersed in a small and deeplyboring book called prefects who gained power
	a study of hogwarts prefects and their later careers,  ron readaloud off the back cover
	that sounds fascinating
	go away, percy snapped
	'course, he's very ambitious, percy, he's got it all plannedout
	he wants to be minister of magic
	ron told harryand hermione in an undertone as they left percy to it
	an hour later, they headed for flourish and blotts
	they were byno means the only ones making their way to the bookshop
	as theyapproached it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors, trying to get in
	the reason for this was proclaimedby a large banner stretched across the upper windowsgilderoy lockhartwill be signing copies of his autobiographymagical metoday 1230 p
	we can actually meet him hermione squealed
	i mean, he'swritten almost the whole booklistthe crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around mrs
	a harrassedlooking wizard stood at the door, saying,calmly, please, ladies
	mind the books, now
	harry, ron, and hermione squeezed inside
	a long line woundright to the back of the shop, where gilderoy lockhart was signinghis books
	they each grabbed a copy of the standard book of spells,grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the weasleyswere standing with mr
	oh, there you are, good, said mrs
	she sounded breathlessand kept patting her hair
	we'll be able to see him in a minute
	gilderoy lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table surroundedby large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlinglywhite teeth at the crowd
	the real lockhart was wearing robes offorgetmenot blue that exactly matched his eyes his pointed wizard'shat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair
	a short, irritablelooking man was dancing around taking photographswith a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke withevery blinding flash
	out of the way, there, he snarled at ron, moving back to get a bettershot
	this is for the daily prophet big deal, said ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer hadstepped on it
	gilderoy lockhart heard him
	he saw ronand then he saw harry
	then he leapt to his feet and positivelyshouted, it can't be harry potterthe crowd parted, whispering excitedly lockhart dived forward, seizedharry's arm, and pulled him to the front
	the crowd burst into applause
	harry's face burned as lockhart shook his hand for the photographer, whowas clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the weasleys
	nice big smile, harry, said lockhart, through his own gleaming teeth
	together, you and i are worth the front page
	when he finally let go of harry's hand, harry could hardly feel his fingers
	he tried to sidle back over to the weasleys, but lockhart threw an armaround his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side
	ladies and gentlemen, he said loudly, waving for quiet
	what anextraordinary moment this is the perfect moment for me to make a littleannouncement i've been sitting on for some timewhen young harry here stepped into flourish and blotts today, he onlywanted to buy my autobiography which i shall be happy to present himnow, free of charge the crowd applauded again
	he had no idea,lockhart continued, giving harry a little shake that made his glasses slip tothe end of his nose, that he would shortly be getting much, much morethan my book, magical me
	he and his schoolmates will, in fact, be gettingthe real magical me
	yes, ladies and gentlemen, i have great pleasure andpride in announcing that this september, i will be taking up the post ofdefense against the dark arts teacher at hogwarts school of witchcraftand wizardrythe crowd cheered and clapped and harry found himself beingpresented with the entire works of gilderoy lockhart
	staggeringslightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of thelimelight to the edge of the room, where ginny was standing next toher new cauldron
	you have these, harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into thecauldron
	i'll buy my own bet you loved that, didn't you, potter said a voice harry had notrouble recognizing
	he straightened up and found himself facetofacewith draco malfoy, who was wearing his usual sneer
	famous harry potter, said malfoy
	can't even go into a bookshopwithout making the front page
	leave him alone, he didn't want all that said ginny
	it was the firsttime she had spoken in front of harry
	she was glaring at malfoy
	potter, you've got yourself a girlfriend drawled malfoy
	ginny wentscarlet as ron and hermione fought their way over, both clutchingstacks of lockhart's books
	oh, it's you, said ron, looking at malfoy as if he were somethingunpleasant on the sole of his shoe
	bet you're surprised to see harryhere, ehnot as surprised as i am to see you in a shop, weasley, retortedmalfoy
	i suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay forall those
	ron went as red as ginny
	he dropped his books into the cauldron,too, and started toward malfoy, but harry and hermione grabbed theback of his jacket
	weasley, struggling over with fred and george
	what are you doing it's too crowded in here, let's go outside
	well, well, well  arthur weasley
	he stood with his hand on draco's shoulder,sneering in just the same way
	weasley, nodding coldly
	busy time at the ministry, i hear, said mr
	i hope they're paying you overtimehe reached into ginny's cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossylockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of a beginner's guideto transfiguration
	dear me, what's the use of being adisgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for itmr
	weasley flushed darker than either ron or ginny
	we have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard,malfoy, he said
	malfoy, his pale eyes straying to mr
	granger, who were watching apprehensively
	the company youkeep, weasley
	and i thought your family could sink no lower 'there was a thud of metal as ginny's cauldron went flying mr
	weasley had thrown himself at mr
	malfoy, knocking him backwardinto a bookshelf
	dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering downon all their heads there was a yell of, get him, dad from fred orgeorge mrs
	weasley was shrieking, no, arthur, no the crowdstampeded backward, knocking more shelves over gentlemen,please  please cried the assistant, and then, louder than allbreak it up, there, gents, break it up hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books
	in an instant he hadpulled mr
	weasley had a cut lip and mr
	malfoy had been hit in the eye by an encyclopedia of toadstools
	he was stillholding ginny's old transfiguration book
	he thrust it at her, his eyesglittering with malice
	here, girl  take your book  it's the best your father can give you  pullinghimself out of hagrid's grip he beckoned to draco and swept from the shop
	yeh should've ignored him, arthur, said hagrid, almost lifting mr
	weasleyoff his feet as he straightened his robes
	rotten ter the core, the whole family,everyone knows that  no malfoy's worth listenin' ter  bad blood, that's what itis  come on now  let's get outta here
	the assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barelycame up to hagrid's waist and seemed to think better of it
	they hurried up thestreet, the grangers shaking with fright and mrs
	weasley beside herself withfury
	a fine example to set for your children
	whatgilderoy lockhart must've thought he was pleased, said fred
	didn't you hear him as we were leaving he wasasking that bloke from the daily prophet if he'd be able to work the fight intohis report  said it was all publicity but it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the leakycauldron, where harry, the weasleys, and all their shopping would betraveling back to the burrow using floo powder
	they said goodbye to thegrangers, who were leaving the pub for the muggle street on the other sidemr
	weasley started to askthem how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on mrs
	harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket beforehelping himself to floo powder
	it definitely wasn't his favorite way totravel
	c h a p t e r    f i v ethe whomping willowthe end of the summer vacation came too quickly for harry's liking
	he was looking forward to getting back to hogwarts, but his monthat the burrow had been the happiest of his life
	it was difficult not tofeel jealous of ron when he thought of the dursleys and the sort ofwelcome he could expect next time he turned up on privet drive
	on their last evening, mrs
	weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinnerthat included all of harry's favorite things, ending with amouthwatering treacle pudding
	fred and george rounded off theevening with a display of filibuster fireworks they fiiled the kitchenwith red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at leasthalf an hour
	then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate andbed
	it took a long while to get started next morning
	they were up atdawn, but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do
	weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks andquills people kept colliding on the stairs, halfdressed with bits of toastin their hands and mr
	weasley nearly broke his neck, tripping over astray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying ginny's trunk to the car
	harry couldn't see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and arat were going to fit into one small ford anglia
	he had reckoned, ofcourse, without the special features that mr
	not a word to molly, he whispered to harry as he opened the
	trunkand showed him how it had been magically expanded so that theluggage fitted easily
	when at last they were all in the car, mrs
	weasley glanced into theback seat, where harry, ron, fred, george, and percy were all sittingcomfortably side by side, and said, muggles do know more than wegive them credit for, don't they she and ginny got into the front seat,which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench
	i mean,you'd never know it was this roomy from the outside, would youmr
	weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard,harry turning back for a last look at the house
	he barely had time towonder when he'd see it again when they were back george hadforgotten his box of filibuster fireworks
	five minutes after that, theyskidded to a halt in the yard so that fred could run in for hisbroomstick
	they had almost reached the highway when ginnyshrieked that she'd left her diary
	by the time she had clambered backinto the car, they were running very late, and tempers were runninghigh
	weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife
	molly, dear no, arthur no one would see  this little button here is an invisibility booster iinstalled  that'd get us up in the air  then we fly above the clouds
	we'd be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser i said no, arthur, not in broad daylight they reached king's cross at a quarter to eleven
	weasleydashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they allhurried into the station
	harry had caught the hogwarts express the previous year
	the trickypart was getting onto platform nine and threequarters, which wasn'tvisible to the muggle eye
	what you had to do was walk through thesolid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten
	it didn't hurt, but it had tobe done carefully so that none of the muggles noticed you vanishing
	percy first, said mrs
	weasley, looking nervously at the clockoverhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappearcasually through the barrier
	percy strode briskly forward and vanished
	weasley went nextfred and george followed
	i'll take ginny and you two come right after us, mrs
	weasley toldharry and ron, grabbing ginny's hand and setting off
	in the blink ofan eye they were gone
	let's go together, we've only got a minute, ron said to harry
	harry made sure that hedwig's cage was safely wedged on top of histrunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier
	he feltperfectly confident this wasn't nearly as uncomfortable as using floopowder
	both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys andwalked purposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed
	a few feetaway from it, they broke into a run and  crash
	both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward ron's trunk felloff with a loud thump, harry was knocked off his feet, and hedwig'scage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shriekingindignantly people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled,what in blazes d'you think you're doinglost control of the trolley, harry gasped, clutching his ribs as hegot up
	ron ran to pick up hedwig, who was causing such a scenethat there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from thesurrounding crowd
	why can't we get through harry hissed to ron
	i dunno ron looked wildly around
	a dozen curious people were stillwatching them
	we're going to miss the train, ron whispered
	i don't understandwhy the gateway's sealed itself harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pitof his stomach
	he wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against thebarrier and pushed with all his might
	the metal remained solid
	it's gone, said ron, sounding stunned
	what ifmum and dad can't get back through to us have you got anymuggle moneyand they marched off through the crowd of curious muggles, out ofthe station and back onto the side road where the old ford anglia wasparked
	ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand
	they heaved their luggage back in, put hedwig on the back seat, andgot into the front
	check that no one's watching, said ron, starting the ignition withanother tap of his wand
	harry stuck his head out of the windowtraffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street wasempty
	ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard
	the car aroundthem vanished  and so did they
	harry could feel the seat vibratingbeneath him, hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and hisglasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had become a pair ofeyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full ofparked cars
	let's go, said ron's voice from his right
	and the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away,dropping out of sight as the car rose in seconds, the whole of londonlay, smoky and glittering, below them
	then there was a popping noise and the car, harry, and ronreappeared
	uhoh, said ron, jabbing at the invisibility booster
	it's faulty both of them pummeled it
	then it flickered backagain
	hold on ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the accelerator they shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everythingturned dull and foggy
	now what said harry, blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressingin on them from all sides
	we need to see the train to know what direction to go in, said ron
	dip back down again  quickly they dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in theirseats, squinting at the ground
	i can see it harry yelled
	right ahead  therethe hogwarts express was streaking along below them like a scarletsnake
	due north, said ron, checking the compass on the dashboard
	okay, we'll just have to check on it every half hour or so  hold onand they shot up through the clouds
	a minute later, they burst outinto a blaze of sunlight
	it was a different world
	the wheels of the car skimmed the sea offluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun
	all we've got to worry about now are airplanes, said ron
	they looked at each other and started to laugh for a long time, theycouldn't stop
	it was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream
	this,thought harry, was surely the only way to travel  past swirls andturrets of snowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fatpack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the prospect of seeingfred's and george's jealous faces when theylanded smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front ofhogwarts castle
	they made regular checks on the train as they flew farther andfarther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a differentview
	london was soon far behind them, replaced by neat greenfields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alivewith cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches
	several uneventful hours later, however, harry had to admit thatsome of the fun was wearing off
	the toffees had made themextremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink
	he and ron hadpulled off their sweaters, but harry's tshirt was sticking to the backof his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweatynose
	he had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now andwas thinking longingly of the train miles below, where you could buyicecold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch
	whyhadn't they been able to get onto platform nine and threequarterscan't be much further, can it croaked ron, hours later still, as thesun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink
	ready for another check on the trainit was still right below them, winding its way past a snowcappedmountain
	it was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds
	ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again,but as he did so, the engine began to whine
	harry and ron exchanged nervous glances
	it's probably just tired, said ron
	it's never been this far before
	and they both pretended not to notice the whining growinglouder and louder as the sky became steadily darker
	stars wereblossoming in the blackness
	harry pulled his sweater back on, trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly, as though in protest
	not far, said ron, more to the car than to harry, not farnow, and he patted the dashboard nervously
	when they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later, theyhad to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew
	there harry shouted, making ron and hedwig jump
	straight aheadsilhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake,stood the many turrets and towers of hogwarts castle
	but the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed
	come on, ron said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a little shake, nearly there, come on the engine groaned
	narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood
	harry found himself gripping the edges of his seatvery hard as they flew toward the lake
	the car gave a nasty wobble
	glancing out of his window, harrysaw the smooth, black, glassy surface of the water, a mile below
	ron's knuckles were white on the steering wheel
	the car wobbledagain
	come on, ron muttered
	they were over the lake  the castle was right ahead  ronput his foot down
	there was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died completely
	uhoh, said ron, into the silence
	the nose of the car dropped
	they were falling, gathering speed,heading straight for the solid castle wall
	noooooo ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around theymissed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc,soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and thenout over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time
	ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out ofhis back pocketstop stop he yelled, whacking the dashboard and thewindshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up towardthemwatch out for that tree harry bellowed, lunging for thesteering wheel, but too latecrunch
	with an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit the thick treetrunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt
	steam wasbillowing from under the crumpled hood hedwig was shrieking interror a golfballsize lump was throbbing on harry's head where hehad hit the windshield and to his right, ron let out a low, despairinggroan
	are you okay harry said urgently
	my wand, said ron, in a shaky voice
	look at my wand it had snapped, almost in two the tip was dangling limply, held on by afew splinters
	harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they'd be able to mend itup at the school, but he never even got started
	at that very moment,something hit his side of the car with the force of acharging bull, sending him lurching sideways into ron, just as anequally heavy blow hit the roof
	what's happen ron gasped, staring through the windshield, and harry looked aroundjust in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it
	the treethey had hit was attacking them
	its trunk was bent almost double, andits gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it couldreach
	aaargh said ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent intohis door the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows fromknucklelike twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram waspounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be cavingrun for it ron shouted, throwing his full weight against his door, butnext second he had been knocked backward into harry's lap by avicious uppercut from another branch
	we're done for he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly thefloor of the car was vibrating  the engine had restarted
	reverse harry yelled, and the car shot backward the tree was stilltrying to hit them they could hear its roots creaking as it almost rippeditself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach
	that, panted ron, was close
	well done, car the car, however, had reached the end of its tether
	with two sharpclunks, the doors flew open and harry felt his seat tip sideways nextthing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground
	loud thuds toldhim that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk hedwig'scage flew through the air and burst open she rose out of it with anangry screech and sped off toward the castlewithout a backward look
	then, dented, scratched, and steaming,the car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily
	come back ron yelled after it, brandishing his broken wand
	dad'll kill mebut the car disappeared from view with one last snort from itsexhaust
	can you believe our luck said ron miserably, bending down topick up scabbers
	of all the trees we could've hit, we had to getone that hits back
	he glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, which was stillflailing its branches threateningly
	come on, said harry wearily, we'd better get up to the school
	it wasn't at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured
	stiff, cold,and bruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began draggingthem up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors
	i think the feast's already started, said ron, dropping his trunk atthe foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through abrightly lit window
	hey  harry  come and look  it's the sortingharry hurried over and, together, he and ron peered in at the greathall
	innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long,crowded tables, making the golden plates and goblets sparkle
	overhead, the bewitched ceiling, which always mirrored the skyoutside, sparkled with stars
	through the forest of pointed black hogwarts hats, harry saw a longline of scaredlooking first years fiiing into the hall
	ginnywas among them, easily visible because of her vivid weasley hair
	meanwhile, professor mcgonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hairin a tight bun, was placing the famous hogwarts sorting hat on astool before the newcomers
	every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted newstudents into the four hogwarts houses gryffindor, hufflepuff,ravenclaw, and slytherin
	harry well remembered putting it on,exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as itmuttered aloud in his ear
	for a few horrible seconds he had fearedthat the hat was going to put him in slytherin, the house that hadturned out more dark witches and wizards than any other but he hadended up in gryffindor, along with ron, hermione, and the rest of theweasleys
	last term, harry and ron had helped gryffindor win thehouse championship, beating slytherin for the first time in sevenyears
	a very small, mousyhaired boy had been called forward to place thehat on his head
	harry's eyes wandered past him to where professordumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the sorting from the stafftable, his long silver beard and halfmoon glasses shining brightly in thecandlelight
	several seats along, harry saw gilderoy lockhart,dressed in robes of aquamarine
	and there at the end was hagrid,huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet
	harry muttered to ron
	there's an empty chair at thestaff table
	where's snapeprofessor severus snape was harry's least favorite teacher
	harryalso happened to be snape's least favorite student
	cruel, sarcastic,and disliked by everybody except the students from his own houseslytherin, snape taught potions
	maybe he's ill said ron hopefully
	maybe he's left, said harry, because he missed out on the defenseagainst dark arts job againor he might have been sacked said ron enthusiastically
	i mean,everyone hates him or maybe, said a very cold voice right behind them, he's waiting tohear why you two didn't arrive on the school train
	there, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze,stood severus snape
	he was a thin man with sallow skin, a hookednose, and greasy, shoulderlength black hair, and at this moment, hewas smiling in a way that told harry he and ron were in very deeptrouble
	follow me, said snape
	not daring even to look at each other, harry and ron followed snapeup the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit withflaming torches
	a delicious smell of food was wafting from the greathall, but snape led them away from the warmth and light, down anarrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons
	in he said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway andpointing
	they entered snape's office, shivering
	the shadowy walls were linedwith shelves of large glass ars, in which floated all manner ofrevolting things harry didn't really want to know the name of at themoment
	the fireplace was dark and empty
	snape closed the doorand turned to look at them
	so, he said softly, the train isn't good enough for the famous harrypotter and his faithful sidekick weasley
	wanted to arrive with a bang,did we, boysno, sir, it was the barrier at king's cross, it silence said snape coldly
	what have you done with thecarron gulped
	this wasn't the first time snape had given harry theimpression of being able to read minds
	but a moment later, he understood, as snape unrolled today's issue of the evening prophet
	you were seen, he hissed, showing them the headline flying ford anglia mystifies muggles
	he began to readaloud two muggles in london, convinced they saw an old carflying over the post office tower
	at noon in norfolk, mrs
	hetty bayliss, while hanging out her washing
	angus fleet,of peebles, reported to police
	six or seven muggles in all
	i believe your father works in the misuse of muggle artifacts officehe said, looking up at ron and smiling still more nastily
	harry felt as though he'd just been walloped in the stomach byone of the mad tree's larger branches
	if anyone found out mr
	weasley had bewitched the car
	he hadn't thought of that
	i noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable damageseems to have been done to a very valuable whomping willow,snape went on
	that tree did more damage to us than we  ron blurted out
	silence snapped snape again
	most unfortunately, you arenot in my house and the decision to expel you does not rest withme
	i shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power
	harry and ron stared at each other, whitefaced
	harry didn'tfeel hungry any more
	he now felt extremely sick
	he tried not tolook at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on ashelf behind snape's desk
	if snape had gone to fetch professormcgonagall, head of gryffindor house, they were hardly any betteroff
	she might be fairer than snape, but she was still extremely strict
	ten minutes later, snape returned, and sure enough it was professormcgonagall who accompanied him
	harry had seen professormcgonagall angry on several occasions, but either he had forgottenjust how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen her this angrybefore
	she raised her wand the moment she entered harry and ronboth flinched, but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, whereflames suddenly erupted
	sit, she said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire
	explain, she said, her glasses glinting ominously
	ron launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the stationrefusing to let them through
	so we had no choice, professor, we couldn't get on the train
	why didn't you send us a letter by owl i believe you have an owlprofessor mcgonagall said coldly to harry
	now she said it, that seemed the obvious thing tohave done
	i  i didn't think that, said professor mcgonagall, is obvious
	there was a knock on the office door and snape, now looking happierthan ever, opened it
	there stood the headmaster, professordumbledore
	harry's whole body went numb
	dumbledore was looking unusuallygrave
	he stared down his very crooked nose at them, andharry suddenly found himself wishing he and ron were still beingbeaten up by the whomping willow
	there was a long silence
	then dumbledore said, please explain whyyou did this
	it would have been better if he had shouted
	harry hated thedisappointment in his voice
	for some reason, he was unable to lookdumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees
	he tolddumbledore everything except that mr
	weasley owned thebewitched car, making it sound as though he and ron had happened tofind a flying car parked outside the station
	he knew dumbledorewould see through this at once, but dumbledore asked no questionsabout the car
	when harry had finished, he merely continued to peerat them through his spectacles
	we'll go and get our stuff, said ron in a hopeless sort of voice
	what are you talking about, weasley barked professormcgonagall
	well, you're expelling us, aren't you said ron
	harry looked quickly at dumbledore
	weasley, said dumbledore
	but i must impress uponboth of you the seriousness of what you have done
	i will be writing toboth your families tonight
	i must also warn you that if you do anythinglike this again, i will have no choice but to expel you
	snape looked as though christmas had been canceled
	he cleared histhroat and said, professor dumbledore, these boys have flouted thedecree for the restriction of underage wizardry, caused seriousdamage to an old and valuable tree  surely acts of this nature it will be for professor mcgonagall to decide on these boys'punishments, severus, said dumbledore calmly
	they are in herhouse and are therefore her responsibility
	he turned to professormcgonagall
	i must go back to the feast, minerva, i've got to giveout a few notices
	come, severus, there's a deliciouslooking custard tart i want to sample snape shot a look of pure venom at harry and ron as he allowedhimself to be swept out of his office, leaving them alone with professor mcgonagall, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle
	you'd better get along to the hospital wing, weasley, you'rebleeding
	not much, said ron, hastily wiping the cut over his eye withhis sleeve
	professor, i wanted to watch my sister being sorted the sorting ceremony is over, said professor mcgonagall
	your sister is also in gryffindor
	and speaking of gryffindor  professor mcgonagall saidsharply, but harry cut in professor, when we took the car, termhadn't started, so  so gryffindor shouldn't really have pointstaken from it  should it he finished, watching her anxiously
	professor mcgonagall gave him a piercing look, but he was sureshe had almost smiled
	her mouth looked less thin, anyway
	i will not take any points from gryffindor, she said, andharry's heart lightened considerably
	but you will both get a detention
	it was better than harry had expected
	as for dumbledore'swriting to the dursleys, that was nothing
	harry knew perfectlywell they'd just be disappointed that the whomping willow hadn'tsquashed him flat
	professor mcgonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at snape'sdesk
	a large plate of sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug oficedpumpkin juice appeared with a pop
	you will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory, shesaid
	i must also return to the feast
	when the door had closed behind her, ron let out a long, low whistle
	i thought we'd had it, he said, grabbing a sandwich
	so did i, said harry, taking one, too
	can you believe our luck, though said ron thickly through amouthful of chicken and ham
	fred and george must've flown thatcar five or six times and no muggle ever saw them
	he swallowedand took another huge bite
	why couldn't we get through the barrierharry shrugged
	we'll have to watch our step from now on, though,he said, taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice
	wish we could'vegone up to the feast
	she didn't want us showing off, said ron sagely
	doesn't wantpeople to think it's clever, arriving by flying car
	when they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could the platekept refilling itself they rose and left the office, treading the familiarpath to gryffindor tower
	the castle was quiet it seemed that thefeast was over
	they walked past muttering portraits and creakingsuits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs, until at lastthey reached the passage where the secret entrance to gryffindortower was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in apink silk dress
	password she said as they approached
	they didn't know the new year's password, not having met agryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost immediately they heardhurrying feet behind them and turned to see hermione dashing towardthem
	there you are where have you been the most ridiculous rumors someone said you'd been expelled for crashing a flying carwell, we haven't been expelled, harry assured her
	you're not telling me you did fly here said hermione, soundingalmost as severe as professor mcgonagall
	skip the lecture, said ron impatiently, and tell us the newpassword
	it's wattlebird, said hermione impatiently, but that's not the point her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat ladyswung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping
	it looked asthough the whole of gryffindor house was still awake, packed intothe circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables andsquashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive
	arms reached throughthe portrait hole to pull harry and ron inside, leaving hermione toscramble in after thent
	brilliant yelled lee jordan
	inspired what an entrance flying acar right into the whomping willow, people'll be talking about thatone for years good for you, said a fifth year harry had never spoken to someonewas patting him on the back as though he'd just won a marathonfred and george pushed their way to the front of the crowd and saidtogether, why couldn't we've come in the car, ehron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but harry couldsee one person who didn't look happy at all
	percy was visible overthe heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be trying toget near enough to start telling them off
	harry nudged ron in theribs and nodded in percy's direction
	ron got the point at once
	got to get upstairs  bit tired, he said, and the two of them startedpushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room,which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories
	'night, harry called back to hermione, who was wearing a scowljust like percy's
	they managed to get to the other side of the common room, stillhaving their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase
	they hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door oftheir old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying second years
	they entered the familiar, circular room, with its five fourpostershung with red velvet and its high, narrow windows
	their trunks hadbeen brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds
	ron grinned guiltily at harry
	i know i shouldn't've enjoyed that or anything, but 'the dormitory door flew open and in came the other second yeargryffindor boys, seamus finnigan, dean thomas, and nevillelongbottom
	unbelievable beamed seamus
	amazing, said neville, awestruck
	harry couldn't help it
	c h a p t e rs i xgilderoy lockhartthe next day, however, harry barely grinned once
	things started to godownhill from breakfast in the great hall
	the four long house tableswere laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains oftoast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceilingtoday, a dull, cloudy gray
	harry and ron sat down at the gryffindortable next to hermione, who had her copy of voyages with vampirespropped open against a milk jug
	there was a slight stiffness in theway she said morning, which told harry that she was stilldisapproving of the way they had arrived
	neville longbottom, on theother hand, greeted them cheerfully
	neville was a roundfaced andaccidentprone boy with the worst memory of anyone harry had evermet
	mail's due any minute  i think gran's sending a few things i forgot
	harry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there wasa rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owlsstreamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into thechattering crowd
	a big, lumpy package bounced off neville's headand, a second later, something large and gray fell into hermione's jug,spraying them all with milk and feathers
	errol said ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet
	errolslumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp redenvelope in his beak
	it's all right, he's still alive, said hermione, prodding errol gently withthe tip of her finger
	it's not that  it's that
	ron was pointing at the red envelope
	it looked quite ordinary toharry, but ron and neville were both looking at it as though theyexpected it to explode
	what's the matter said harry
	she's  she's sent me a howler, said ron faintly
	you'd better open it, ron, said neville in a timid whisper
	it'll beworse if you don't my gran sent me one once, and i ignored it and he gulped  it was horrible
	harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope
	what's a howler he said
	but ron's whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun tosmoke at the corners
	open it, neville urged
	it'll all be over in a few minutes ron stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from errol'sbeak, and slit it open
	neville stuffed his fingers in his ears
	a splitsecond later, harry knew why
	he thought for a moment it hadexploded a roar of sound fiiled the huge hall, shaking dust from theceiling
	stealing the car, i wouldn't have been surprised if they'd expelled you, you wait till i get hold of you, i don't suppose you stopped tothink what your father and i went through whenwe saw it was gone mrs
	weasleys yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made theplates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off thestone walls
	people throughout the hall were swiveling around to seewho had received the howler, and ron sank so low in his chair thatonly his crimson forehead could be seen
	letter from dumbledore last night, i thoughtyour father would die of shame, we didn't bringyou up to behave like this, you and harry couldboth have died harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up
	hetried very hard to look as though he couldn't hear the voice that wasmaking his eardrums throb
	absolutely disgusted  your father's facing aninquiry at work, it's entirely your fault and ifyou put another toe out of line we'll bring youstraight back home
	a ringing silence fell
	the red envelope, which had dropped from ron'shand, burst into flames and curled into ashes
	harry and ron satstunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them
	a fewpeople laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again
	hermione closed voyages with vampires and looked down at the topof ron's head
	well, i don't know what you expected, ron, but you don't tell me i deserved it, snapped ron
	harry pushed his porridge away
	his insides were burning with guilt
	weasley was facing an inquiry at work
	weasley had done for him over the summer
	but he had no time to dwell on this professor mcgonagall wasmoving along the gryffindor table, handing out course schedules
	harry took his and saw that they had double herbology with thehufepuffs first
	harry, ron, and hermione left the castle together, crossed thevegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magicalplants were kept
	at least the howler had done one good thinghermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough andwas being perfectly friendly again
	as they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the classstanding outside, waiting for professor sprout
	harry, ron, andhermione had only just joined them when she came striding into viewacross the lawn, accompanied by gilderoy lockhart
	professorsprout's arms were full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt,harry spotted the whomping willow in the distance, several of itsbranches now in slings
	professor sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat overher flyaway hair there was usually a large amount of earth on herclothes and her fingernails would have made aunt petunia faint
	gilderoy lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping robes ofturquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoisehat with gold trimming
	oh, hello there he called, beaming around at the assembledstudents
	just been showing professor sprout the right way to doctora whomping willow but i don't want you running away with the ideathat i'm better at herbology than she is i just happen to have metseveral of these exotic plants on my travels
	greenhouse three today, chaps said professor sprout, who waslooking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self
	there was a murmur of interest
	they had only ever worked ingreenhouse one before  greenhouse three housed far more interestingand dangerous plants
	professor sprout took a large key from her beltand unlocked the door
	harry caught a whiff of damp earth andfertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrellasized flowers dangling from the ceiling
	he was about to follow ronand hermione inside when lockhart's hand shot out
	harry i've been wanting a word  you don't mind if he's a couple ofminutes late, do you, professor sproutjudging by professor sprout's scowl, she did mind, but lockhart said,that's the ticket, and closed the greenhouse door in her face
	harry, said lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlightas he shook his head
	completely nonplussed, harry said nothing
	when i heard well, of course, it was all my fault
	could have kickedmyself
	harry had no idea what he was talking about
	he was about to say sowhen lockhart went on, don't know when i've been more shocked
	flying a car to hogwarts well, of course, i knew at once why you'ddone it
	it was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliantteeth even when he wasn't talking
	gave you a taste for publicity, didn't i said lockhart
	you got onto the front page of the paper with me andyou couldn't wait to do it again
	oh, no, professor, see harry, harry, harry, said lockhart, reaching out and graspinghis shoulder
	natural to want a bit more once you'vehad that first taste  and i blame myself for giving you that, because it was bound to go to your head  but see here, young man,you can't start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed
	just calmdown, all right plenty of time for all that when you're older
	yes,yes, i know what you're thinking 'it's all right for him, he's an internationally famous wizard already' but when i was twelve, i wasjust as much of a nobody as you are now
	in fact, id say i was evenmore of a nobody i mean, a few people have heard of you, haven'tthey all that business with heomustnotbenamed heglanced at the lightning scar on harry's forehead
	i know, iknow  it's not quite as good as winning witch weekly's mostcharmingsmile award five times in a row, as i have  but it's astart, harry, it's a start
	he gave harry a hearty wink and strode off
	harry stoodstunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed tobe in the greenhouse, he opened the door and slid inside
	professor sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse
	about twenty pairs of differentcolored earmuffs were lying on the bench
	when harry had taken his placebetween ron and hermione, she said, we'll be repotting mandrakes today
	now, who can tell me the properties of the mandraketo nobody's surprise, hermione's hand was first into the air
	mandrake, or mandragora, is a powerful restorative, said hermione,sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook
	it isused to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to theiroriginal state
	ten points to gryffindor, said professor sprout
	themandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes
	it is also,however, dangerous
	who can tell me whyhermione's hand narrowly missed harry's glasses as it shot up again
	the cry of the mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it, she saidpromptly
	take another ten points, said professor sprout
	now, themandrakes we have here are still very young
	she pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyoneshuffled forward for a better look
	a hundred or so tufty little plants,purplish green in color, were growing there in rows
	they looked quiteunremarkable to harry, who didn't have the slightest idea whathermione meant by the cry of the mandrake
	everyone take a pair of earmuffs, said professor sprout
	there was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn'tpink and fluffy
	when i tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completelycovered, said professor sprout
	when it is safe to remove them, iwill give you the thumbsup
	harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears
	they shut out soundcompletely
	professor sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her ownears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plantsfirmly, and pulled hard
	harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear
	instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped outof the earth
	the leaves were growing right out of his head
	he hadpale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of hislungs
	professor sprout took a large plant pot from under the table andplunged the mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost untilonly the tufted leaves were visible
	professor sprout dusted off herhands, gave them all the thumbsup, and removed her own earmuffs
	as our mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won't kill yet, shesaid calmly as though she'd just done nothing more exciting than watera begonia
	however, they will knock you out for several hours, and asi'm sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure yourearmuffs are securely in place while you work
	i will attract yourattention when it is time to pack up
	four to a tray  there is a large supply of pots here  compost in thesacks over there  and be careful of the venemous tentacula, it'steething
	she gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, makingit draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over hershoulder
	harry, ron, and hermione were joined at their tray by a curlyhairedhufflepuff boy harry knew by sight but had never spoken to
	justin finchfletchley, he said brightly, shaking harry by the hand
	know who you are, of course, the famous harry potter
	and you'rehermione granger  always top in everythinghermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too  and ronweasley
	wasn't that your flying carron didn't smile
	the howler was obviously still on his mind
	that lockhart's something, isn't he said justin happily as theybegan fiiling their plant pots with dragon dung compost
	have you read his books id have died of fear if id beencornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and zap  just fantastic
	my name was down for eton, you know
	i can't tell you how glad iam i came here instead
	of course, mother was slightly disappointed,but since i made her read lockhart's books i think she's begun to seehow useful it'll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family
	after that they didn't have much chance to talk
	their earmuffs wereback on and they needed to concentrate on the mandrakes
	professorsprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn't
	the mandrakesdidn't like coming out of the earth, but didn't seem to want to go backinto it either
	they squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, andgnashed their teeth harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash aparticularly fat one into a pot
	by the end of the class, harry, like everyone else, was sweaty,aching, and covered in earth
	everyone traipsed back to the castle fora quick wash and then the gryffindors hurried off to transfiguration
	professor mcgonagall's classes were always hard work, but todaywas especially difficult
	everything harry had learned last yearseemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer
	he wassupposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managedto do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over thedesktop avoiding his wand
	ron was having far worse problems
	he had patched up his wandwith some borrowed spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyondrepair
	it kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every timeron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smokethat smelled of rotten eggs
	unable to see what he was doing, ronaccidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for anew one
	professor mcgonagall wasn't pleased
	harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell
	his brain felt like a wrungsponge
	everyone fiied out of the classroom except him and ron, whowas whacking his wand furiously on the desk
	stupid  useless  thing write home for another one, harry suggested as the wand let off avolley of bangs like a firecracker
	oh, yeah, and get another howler back, said ron, stuffing the nowhissing wand into his bag
	it's your own fault your wand got snapped 'they went down to lunch, where ron's mood was not improved byhermione's showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she hadproduced in transfiguration
	what've we got this afternoon said harry, hastily changing thesubject
	defense against the dark arts, said hermione at once
	why, demanded ron, seizing her schedule, have you outlined alllockhart's lessons in little heartshermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously
	they finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard
	hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in voyageswith vampires again
	harry and ron stood talking about quidditch forseveral minutes before harry became aware that he was being closelywatched
	looking up, he saw the very small, mousyhaired boy he'dseen trying on the sorting hat last night staring at harry as thoughtransfixed
	he was clutching what looked like an ordinary mugglecamera, and the moment harry looked at him, he went bright red
	all right, harry i'm i'm colin creevey, he said breathlessly, takinga tentative step forward
	i'm in gryffindor, too
	d'you think  would itbe all right if  can i have a picture he said, raising the camerahopefully
	a picture harry repeated blankly
	so i can prove i've met you, said colin creevey eagerly, edgingfurther forward
	i know all about you
	abouthow you survived when youknowwho tried to kill you and how hedisappeared and everything and how you've still got a lightning scar onyour forehead his eyes raked harry's hairline and a boy in mydormitory said if i develop the film in the right potion, the pictures'llmove
	colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said,it's amazing here, isn't it i never knew all the odd stuff i could dowas magic till i got the letter from hogwarts
	my dad's a milkman, hecouldn't believe it either
	so i'm taking loads of pictures to send hometo him
	and it'd be really good if i had one of you  he lookedimploringly at harry  maybe your friend could take it and i couldstand next to you and then, could you sign itsigned photos you're giving out signed photos, potterloud and scathing, draco malfoy's voice echoed around thecourtyard
	he had stopped right behind colin, flanked, as he alwayswas at hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, crabbe andgoyle
	everyone line up malfoy roared to the crowd
	harry potter'sgiving out signed photosno, i'm not, said harry angrily, his fists clenching
	you're just jealous, piped up colin, whose entire body was aboutas thick as crabbe's neck
	jealoussaid malfoy, who didn't need to shout anymore half thecourtyard was listening in
	of what i don't want a foul scar rightacross my head, thanks
	i don't think getting your head cut openmakes you that special, myself
	crabbe and goyle were sniggering stupidly
	eat slugs, malfoy, said ron angrily
	crabbe stopped laughing andstarted rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way
	be careful, weasley, sneered malfoy
	you don't want to start anytrouble or your mommy'll have to come and take you away fromschool
	he put on a shrill, piercing voice
	ifyou put another toeout of line'  a knot of slytherin fifthyears nearby laughed loudly at this
	weasley would like a signed photo, potter, smirked malfoy
	it'dbe worth more than his family's whole house ron whipped out his spellotaped wand, but hermione shut voyageswith vampires with a snap and whispered, look outwhat's all this, what's all this gilderoy lockhart was stridingtoward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him
	who's giving out signed photosharry started to speak but he was cut short as lockhart flung anarm around his shoulders and thundered jovially, shouldn't haveasked we meet again, harrypinned to lockhart's side and burning with humiliation, harrysaw malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd
	creevey, said lockhart, beaming at colin
	a double portrait, can't do better than that, and we'll both sign itfor you
	colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bellrang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes
	off you go, move along there, lockhart called to the crowd,and he set off back to the castle with harry, who was wishing heknew a good vanishing spell, still clasped to his side
	a word to the wise, harry, said lockhart paternally as theyentered the building through a side door
	i covered up for youback there with young creevey  if he was photographing me,too, your schoolmates won't think you're setting yourself up somuch
	deaf to harry's stammers, lockhart swept him down a corridorlined with staring students and up a staircase
	let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage ofyour career isn't sensible  looks a tad bigheaded, harry, to befrank
	there may well come a time when, like me, you'll need tokeep a stack handy wherever you go, but  he gave a little chortle  i don't think you're quite there yet
	they had reached lockhart's classroom and he let harry go atlast
	harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the veryback of the class, where he busied himself with piling all seven oflockhart's books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking at thereal thing
	the rest of the class came clattering in, and ron and hermione satdown on either side of harry
	you could've fried an egg on your face said ron
	you'd better hopecreevey doesn't meet ginny, or they'll be starting a harry potter fanclub
	shut up, snapped harry
	the last thing he needed was for lockhartto hear the phrase harry potter fan club
	when the whole class was seated, lockhart cleared his throat loudlyand silence fell
	he reached forward, picked up neville longbottom'scopy of travels with trolls, and held it up to show his own, winkingportrait on the front
	me, he said, pointing at it and winking as well
	gilderoy lockhart,order of merlin, third class, honorary member of the dark forcedefense league, and fivetime winner of witch weekly's mostcharmingsmile award  but i don't talk about that
	i didn't get rid ofthe bandon banshee by smiling at herhe waited for them to laugh a few people smiled weakly
	i see you've all bought a complete set of my books well done
	ithought we'd start today with a little quiz
	nothing to worry aboutjust to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in when he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front ofthe class and said, you have thirty minutes  start  nowharry looked down at his paper and read1
	what is gilderoy lockhart 's favorite color2
	what is gilderoy lockhart's secret ambition3
	what, in your opinion, is gilderoy lockhart's greatestachievement to dateon and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to54
	when is gilderoy lockhart's birthday, and what would hisideal gift behalf an hour later, lockhart collected the papers and rifled throughthem in front of the class
	tut, tut  hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color islilac
	i say so in year with the yeti
	and a few of you need to readwanderings with werewolves more carefully  i clearly state in chaptertwelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between allmagic and nonmagic peoples  though i wouldn't say no to a largebottle of ogdeds old firewhiskyhe gave them another roguish wink
	ron was now staring atlockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face seamusfinnigan and dean thomas, who were sitting in front, were shakingwith silent laughter
	hermione, on the other hand, was listening tolockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned hername
	but miss hermione granger knew my secret ambition is to rid theworld of evil and market my own range of haircare potions  goodgirl in fact  he flipped her paper over  full marks where is misshermione grangerhermione raised a trembling hand
	excellent beamed lockhart
	quite excellent take ten points forgryffindor and so  to business he bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it
	now  be warned it is my job to arm you against the foulestcreatures known to wizardkind you may find yourselves facing yourworst fears in this room
	know only that no harm can befall you whilsti am here
	all i ask is that you remain calm
	in spite of himself, harry leaned around his pile of books for a betterlook at the cage
	lockhart placed a hand on the cover
	dean andseamus had stopped laughing now
	neville was cowering in his frontrow seat
	i must ask you not to scream, said lockhart in a low voice
	it mightprovoke them
	as the whole class held its breath, lockhart whipped off the cover
	yes, he said dramatically
	freshly caught cornish pixies
	seamus finnigan couldn't control himself
	he let out a snort oflaughter that even lockhart couldn't mistake for a scream of terror
	yes he smiled at seamus
	well, they're not  they're not very  dangerous, are they seamuschoked
	don't be so sure said lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly atseamus
	devilish tricky little blighters they can bethe pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointedfaces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgiesarguing
	the moment the cover had been removed, theyhad started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars andmaking bizarre faces at the people nearest them
	right, then, lockhart said loudly
	let's see what you make ofthem and he opened the cage
	the pixies shot in every direction like rockets
	two of them seized neville by the ears and lifted him into the air
	several shot straight through the window, showering the back rowwith broken glass
	the rest proceeded to wreck the classroom moreeffectively than a rampaging rhino
	they grabbed ink bottles andsprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore picturesfrom the walls, upended the waste basket, grabbed bags and booksand threw them out of the smashed window within minutes, half theclass was sheltering under desks and neville was swinging from theiron chandelier in the ceiling
	come on now  round them up, round them up, they're only pixies,lockhart shouted
	he rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed,peskipiksi pesternomiit had absolutely no effect one of the pixies seized his wand andthrew it out of the window, too
	lockhart gulped and dived under hisown desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by neville, who fell asecond later as the chandelier gave way
	the bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit
	in the relativecalm that followed, lockhart straightened up, caught sight of harry,ron, and hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, well, i'llask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage
	heswept past them and shut the door quickly behind him
	can you believe him roared ron as one of the remaining pixies bithim painfully on the ear
	he just wants to give us some handson experience, said hermione,immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever freezing charm andstuffing them back into their cage
	hands on said harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out ofreach with its tongue out
	hermione, he didn't have a clue what hewas doing rubbish, said hermione
	you've read his books  look at all thoseamazing things he's done he says he's done, ron muttered
	c h a p t e r   s e v e nmudbloods and murmursharry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sightwhenever he saw gilderoy lockhart coming down a corridor
	harderto avoid was colin creevey, who seemed to have memorized harry'sschedule
	nothing seemed to give colin a bigger thrill than to say, allright, harry six or seven times a day and hear, hello, colin, back,however exasperated harry sounded when he said it
	hedwig was still angry with harry about the disasterous car journeyand ron's wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on fridaymorning by shooting out of ron's hand in charms and hitting tiny oldprofessor flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large,throbbing green boil where it had struck
	so with one thing andanother, harry was quite glad to reach the weekend
	he, ron, andhermione were planning to visit hagrid on saturday morning
	harry,however, was shaken awake several hours earlierthan he would have liked by oliver wood, captain of the gryffindorquidditch team
	whassamatter said harry groggily
	quidditch practice said wood
	come onharry squinted at the window
	there was a thin mist hanging acrossthe pinkandgold sky
	now that he was awake, he couldn'tunderstand how he could have slept through the racket the birds weremaking
	oliver, harry croaked
	it's the crack of dawn
	he was a tall and burly sixth year and, at themoment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm
	it's partof our new training program
	come on, grab your broom, and let's go,said wood heartily
	none of the other teams have started training yetwe're going to be first off the mark this year yawning and shivering slightly, harry climbed out of bed and tried tofind his quidditch robes
	meet you on the field in fifteen minutes
	when he'd found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak forwarmth, harry scribbled a note to ron explaining where he'd gone andwent down the spiral staircase to the common room, his nimbus twothousand on his shoulder
	he had just reached the portrait hole whenthere was a clatter behind him and colin creevey came dashing downthe spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck andsomething clutched in his hand
	i heard someone saying your name on the stairs, harry look whati've got here i've had it developed, i wanted to show you harry looked bemusedly at the photograph colin was brandishingunder his nose
	a moving, blackandwhite lockhart was tugging hard on an armharry recognized as his own
	he was pleased to see that hisphotographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to bedragged into view
	as harry watched, lockhart gave up andslumped, panting, against the white edge of the picture
	will you sign it said colin eagerly
	no, said harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room wasreally deserted
	sorry, colin, i'm in a hurry  quidditch practice he climbed through the portrait hole
	oh, wow wait for me i've never watched a quidditch gamebeforecolin scrambled through the hole after him
	it'll be really boring, harry said quickly, but colin ignored him, hisface shining with excitement
	you were the youngest house player in a hundred years, weren'tyou, harry weren't you said colin, trotting alongside him
	youmust be brilliant
	is it easy is that your ownbroom is that the best one there isharry didn't know how to get rid of him
	it was like having anextremely talkative shadow
	i don't really understand quidditch, said colin breathlessly
	is ittrue there are four balls and two of them fly around trying to knockpeople off their broomsyes, said harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicatedrules of quidditch
	they're called bludgers
	there are two beaterson each team who carry clubs to beat the bludgers away from theirside
	fred and george weasley are the gryffindor beaters
	and what are the other balls for colin asked, tripping down acouple of steps because he was gazing openmouthed at harry
	well, the quafe  that's the biggish red one  is the one that scoresgoals
	three chasers on each team throw the quaffle to each otherand try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch they're three long poles with hoops on the end
	and the fourth ball  is the golden snitch, said harry, and it's very small, very fast, anddifficult to catch
	but that's what the seeker's got to do, because agame of quidditch doesn't end until the snitch has been caught
	andwhichever team's seeker gets the snitch earns his team an extrahundred and fifty points
	and you're the gryffindor seeker, aren't you said colin in awe
	yes, said harry as they left the castle and started across the dewdrenched grass
	and there's the keeper, too
	he guards the goalposts
	but colin didn't stop questioning harry all the way down the slopinglawns to the quidditch field, and harry only shook him off when hereached the changing rooms colin called after him in a piping voice,i'll go and get a good seat, harry and hurried off to the stands
	the rest of the gryffindor team were already in the changing room
	wood was the only person who looked truly awake
	fred and georgeweasley were sitting, puffyeyed and touslehaired, next to fourth yearalicia spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behindher
	her fellow chasers, katiebell and angelina johnson, were yawning side by side oppositethem
	there you are, harry, what kept you said wood briskly
	now, iwanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field,because i spent the summer devising a whole new training program,which i really think will make all the difference
	wood was holding up a large diagram of a quidditch field, on whichwere drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in differentcolored inks
	he took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began towiggle over the diagram like caterpillars
	as wood launched into aspeech about his new tactics, fred weasley's head drooped rightonto alicia spinnet's shoulder and he began to snore
	the first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there wasanother board under that, and a third under that one
	harry sank intoa stupor as wood droned on and on
	so, said wood, at long last, jerking harry from a wistful fantasyabout what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment upat the castle
	is that clear any questionsi've got a question, oliver, said george, who had woken with astart
	why couldn't you have told us all this yesterday when wewere awakewood wasn't pleased
	now, listen here, you lot, he said, glowering at them all
	weshould have won the quidditch cup last year
	we're easily the bestteam
	but unfortunately owing to circumstances beyond our control harry shifted guiltily in his seat
	he had been unconscious in thehospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning thatgryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worstdefeat in three hundred years
	wood took a moment to regain control of himself
	their last defeatwas clearly still torturing him
	so this year, we train harder than ever before
	okay, let's go andput our new theories into practice wood shouted, seizing hisbroomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms
	stiffleggedand still yawning, his team followed
	they had been in the locker room so long that the sun was upcompletely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in thestadium
	as harry walked onto the field, he saw ron and hermionesitting in the stands
	aren't you finished yet called ron incredulously
	haven't even started, said harry, looking jealously at the toast andmarmalade ron and hermione had brought out of the great hall
	wood's been teaching us new moves
	he mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up intothe air
	the cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far moreeffectively than wood's long talk
	it felt wonderful to be back on thequidditch field
	he soared right around the stadium at full speed,racing fred and george
	what's that funny clicking noise called fred as they hurtled aroundthe corner
	harry looked into the stands
	colin was sitting in one of the highestseats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the soundstrangely magnified in the deserted stadium
	look this way, harry this way he cried shrilly
	no idea, harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as faraway as possible from colin
	what's going on said wood, frowning, as he skimmed through theair toward them
	why's that first year taking pictures i don't like it
	he could be a slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new trainingprogram
	he's in gryffindor, said harry quickly
	and the slytherins don't need a spy, oliver, said george
	what makes you say that said wood testily
	because they're here in person, said george, pointing
	several people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticksin their hands
	i don't believe it wood hissed in outrage
	i booked the field fortoday we'll see about thiswood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant toin his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted
	harry, fred, andgeorge followed
	flint wood bellowed at the slytherin captain
	this is our practicetime we got up specially you can clear off nowmarcus flint was even larger than wood
	he had a look of trollishcunning on his face as he replied, plenty of room for all of us, wood
	angelina, alicia, and katie had come over, too
	there were no girlson the slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing thegryffindors, leering to a man
	but i booked the field said wood, positively spitting with rage
	ibooked itah, said flint
	but i've got a specially signed note here fromprofessor snape
	snape, give the slytherin teampermission to practice today on the quidditch field owing to the need totrain their new seeker
	'you've got a new seeker said wood, distracted
	whereand from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh,smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face
	aren't you lucius malfoy's son said fred, looking at malfoy withdislike
	funny you should mention draco's father, said flint as the wholeslytherin team smiled still more broadly
	let me show you thegenerous gift he's made to the slytherin team
	all seven of them held out their broomsticks
	seven highly polished,brandnew handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling thewords nimbus two thousand and one gleamed under the gryffindors'noses in the early morning sun
	only came out last month, said flint carelessly,flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own
	i believe it outstripsthe old two thousand series by a considerable amount
	as for the oldcleansweeps  he smiled nastily at fred and george, who were bothclutching cleansweep fives  sweeps the board with them
	none of the gryffindor team could think of anything to say for amoment
	malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reducedto slits
	ron and hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on
	what's happening ron asked harry
	why aren't you playing andwhat's he doing herehe was looking at malfoy, taking in his slytherin quidditch robes
	i'm the new slytherin seeker, weasley, said malfoy, smugly
	everyone's just been admiring the brooms my father's bought ourteam
	ron gaped, openmouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front ofhim
	good, aren't they said malfoy smoothly
	but perhaps thegryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms,too
	you could raffle off those cleansweep fives i expect a museumwould bid for them
	the slytherin team howled with laughter
	at least no one on the gryffindor team had to buy their way in, saidhermione sharply
	they got in on pure talent
	the smug look on malfoy's face flickered
	no one asked your opinion, you fiithy little mudblood, he spat
	harry knew at once that malfoy had said something really badbecause there was an instant uproar at his words
	flint had to dive infront of malfoy to stop fred and george jumping on him, aliciashrieked, how dare you  and ron plunged his hand into his robes,pulled out his wand, yelling, you'll pay for that one, malfoy andpointed it furiously under flint's arm at malfoys face
	a loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shotout of the wrong end of ron's wand, hitting him in the stomach andsending him reeling backward onto the grass
	ron ron are you all right squealed hermione
	ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out
	instead hegave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouthonto his lap
	the slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter
	flint was doubledup, hanging onto his new broomstick for support
	malfoy was on allfours, banging the ground with his fist
	the gryffindors weregathered around ron, who kept belching large, glistening slugs
	nobody seemed to want to touch him
	we'd better get him to hagrid's, it's nearest, said harry tohermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled ron upby the arms
	what happened, harry what happened is he ill but you cancure him, can't you colin had run down from his seat and was nowdancing alongside them as they left the field
	ron gave a huge heaveand more slugs dribbled down his front
	oooh, said colin, fascinated and raising his camera
	can you holdhim still, harryget out of the way, colin said harry angrily
	he and hermionesupported ron out of the stadium and across the grounds towardthe edge of the forest
	nearly there, ron, said hermione as the gamekeeper's cabin cameinto view
	you'll be all right in a minute  almost there they were within twenty feet of hagrid's house when the front dooropened, but it wasn't hagrid who emerged
	gilderoy lockhart,wearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out
	quick, behind here, harry hissed, dragging ron behind a nearbybush
	hermione followed, somewhat reluctantly
	it's a simple matter if you know what you're doing lockhart wassaying loudly to hagrid
	if you need help, you know where i am i'lllet you have a copy of my book
	i'm surprised you haven't already gotone  i'll sign one tonight and send it over
	well, goodbye and hestrode away toward the castle
	harry waited until lockhart was out of sight, then pulled ron out ofthe bush and up to hagrid's front door
	they knocked urgently
	hagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expressionbrightened when he saw who it was
	bin wonderin' when you'd come ter see me  come in, come in thought you mighta bin professor lockhart back again harry and hermione supported ron over the threshold into the oneroomed cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a firecrackling merrily in the other
	hagrid didn't seem perturbed by ron'sslug problem, which harry hastily explained as he lowered ron into achair
	better out than in, he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin infront of him
	i don't think there's anything to do except wait for it to stop, saidhermione anxiously, watching ron bend over the basin
	that's adifficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand hagrid was bustling around making them tea
	his boarhound, fang,was slobbering over harry
	what did lockhart want with you, hagrid harry asked, scratchingfang's ears
	givin' me advice on gettin' kelpies out of a well, growledhagrid, moving a halfplucked rooster off his scrubbed table andsetting down the teapot
	an' bangin' on aboutsome banshee he banished
	if one word of it was true, i'll eat mykettle
	it was most unlike hagrid to criticize a hogwarts' teacher, and harrylooked at him in surprise
	hermione, however, said in a voicesomewhat higher than usual, i think you're being a bit unfair
	professor dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man forthe job he was the on' man for the job, said hagrid, offering them a yplate of treacle fudge, while ron coughed squelchily into his basin
	an' i mean the on' one
	gettin' very difficult ter find anyone fer ythe dark arts job
	people aren't too keen ter take it on, see
	they'restartin' ter think it's jinxed
	no one's lasted long fer a while now
	sotell me, said hagrid, jerking his head at ron
	who was he tryin' tercursemalfoy called hermione something  it must've been really bad,because everyone went wild
	it was bad, said ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop lookingpale and sweaty
	malfoy called her mudblood,' hagrid ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made theirappearance
	hagrid looked outraged
	he didn' he growled at hermione
	but i don't know what it means
	i could tell itwas really rude, of course it's about the most insulting thing he could think of, gasped ron,coming back up
	mudblood's a really foul name for someone who ismuggleborn  you know, nonmagic parents
	there aresome wizards  like malfoy's family  who think they're better thaneveryone else because they're what people call pureblood
	hegave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand
	hethrew it into the basin and continued, i mean, the rest of us know itdoesn't make any difference at all
	look at neville longbottom he's pureblood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right wayup
	an' they haven't invented a spell our hermione can' do, said hagridproudly, making hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta
	it's a disgusting thing to call someone, said ron, wiping his sweatybrow with a shaking hand
	most wizards these days are halfblood anyway
	if wehadn't married muggles we'd've died out
	he retched and ducked out of sight again
	well, i don' blame yeh fer tryin' ter curse him, ron, said hagridloudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin
	bu' maybe itwas a good thing yer wand backfired
	'spect lucius malfoywould've come marchin' up ter school if yeh'd cursed his son
	leastyer not in trouble
	harry would have pointed out that trouble didn't come much worsethan having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn't hagrid'streacle fudge had cemented his jaws together
	harry, said hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought
	gotta bone ter pick with yeh
	i've heard you've bin givin' out signedphotos
	how come i haven't got onefurious, harry wrenched his teeth apart
	i have not been giving out signed photos, he said hotly
	iflockhart's still spreading that around but then he saw that hagrid was laughing
	i'm on'y jokin', he said, patting harry genially on the back andsending him face first into the table
	i knew yeh hadn't really
	i toldlockhart yeh didn' need teh
	yer more famous than him withouttryin'
	bet he didn't like that, said harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin
	don' think he did, said hagrid, his eyes twinkling
	an' then i toldhim id never read one o' his books an' he decided ter go
	treaclefudge, ron he added as ron reappeared
	no thanks, said ron weakly
	come an' see what i've bin growin', said hagrid as harry andhermione finished the last of their tea
	in the small vegetable patch behind hagrid's house were a dozen ofthe largest pumpkins harry had ever seen
	each was the size of alarge boulder
	gettin' on well, aren't they said hagrid happily
	fer the halloweenfeast
	should be big enough by then
	what've you been feeding them said harry
	hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone
	well, i've bin givin' them  you know  a bit o' help harry noticed hagrid's flowery pink umbrella leaning against the backwall of the cabin
	harry had had reason to believe before now thatthis umbrella was not all it looked in fact, he had the strongimpression that hagrid's old school wand was concealed inside it
	hagrid wasn't supposed to use magic
	he had been expelled fromhogwarts in his third year, but harry had never found out why anymention of the matter and hagrid would clear histhroat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject waschanged
	an engorgement charm, i suppose said hermione, halfwaybetween disapproval and amusement
	well, you've done a good job onthem
	that's what yer little sister said, said hagrid, nodding at ron
	mether jus' yesterday
	hagrid looked sideways at harry, his beardtwitching
	said she was jus' lookin' round the grounds, but i reckonshe was hopin' she might run inter someone else at my house
	if yeh ask me, she wouldn' say no ter a signed oh, shut up, said harry
	ron snorted with laughter and the groundwas sprayed with slugs
	watch it hagrid roared, pulling ron away from his preciouspumpkins
	it was nearly lunchtime and as harry had only had one bit of treaclefudge since dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat
	they saidgoodbye to hagrid and walked back up to the castle, ron hiccoughingoccasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs
	they had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rangout, there you are, potter  weasley
	professor mcgonagall waswalking toward them, looking stern
	you will both do your detentionsthis evening
	what're we doing, professor said ron, nervously suppressing aburp
	you will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with mr
	filch,said professor mcgonagall
	and no magic, weasley  elbow grease
	argus filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every studentin the school
	and you, potter, will be helping professor lockhart answer his fanmail, said professor mcgonagall
	oh no  professor, can't i go and do the trophy room, too said harrydesperately
	certainly not, said professor mcgonagall, raising her eyebrows
	professor lockhart requested you particularly
	eight o'clock sharp,both of you
	harry and ron slouched into the great hall in states of deepestgloom, hermione behind them, wearing a wellyoudidbreakschoolrules  sort of expression
	harry didn't enjoy his shepherd's pie asmuch as he'd thought
	both he and ron felt they'd got the worse deal
	filch'll have me there all night, said ron heavily
	no magic theremust be about a hundred cups in that room
	i'm no good at mugglecleaning
	i'd swap anytime, said harry hollowly
	i've had loads of practicewith the dursleys
	answering lockhart's fan mail
	he'll be anightmare
	saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like notime, it was five minutes to eight, and harry was dragging his feetalong the secondfloor corridor to lockhart's office
	he gritted histeeth and knocked
	the door flew open at once
	lockhart beamed down at him
	ah, here's the scalawag he said
	come in, harry, come in shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles werecountless framed photographs of lockhart
	he had even signed a fewof them
	another large pile lay on his desk
	you can address the envelopes lockhart told harry, as thoughthis was a huge treat
	this first one's to gladys gudgeon, bless her huge fan of mine the minutes snailed by
	harry let lockhart's voice wash over him,occasionally saying, mmm and right and yeah
	now and thenhe caught a phrase like, fame's a fickle friend, harry, or celebrityis as celebrity does, remember that
	the candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over themany moving faces of lockhart watching him
	harry moved hisaching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing outveronica smethley's address
	it must be nearly time to leave, harrythought miserably, please let it be nearly time
	and then he heard something  something quite apart from thespitting of the dying candles and lockhart's prattle about his fans
	it was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice ofbreathtaking, icecold venom
	harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on veronicasmethley's street
	six solid months at the top of the bestseller list broke all recordsno, said harry frantically
	that voicesorry said lockhart, looking puzzled
	what voicethat  that voice that said  didn't you hear itlockhart was looking at harry in high astonishment
	what are you talking about, harry perhaps you're getting a littledrowsy great scott  look at the time we've been here nearly fourhours id never have believed it  the time's flown, hasn't itharry didn't answer
	he was straining his ears to hear the voice again,but there was no sound now except for lockhart telling him he mustn'texpect a treat like this every time he got detention
	feeling dazed,harry left
	it was so late that the gryffindor common room was almost empty
	harry went straight up to the dormitory
	harrypulled on his pajamas, got into bed, and waited
	half an hour later, ronarrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish intothe darkened room
	my muscles have all seized up, he groaned, sinking on his bed
	fourteen times he made me buff up that quidditch cup before he wassatisfied
	and then i had another slug attack all over a special awardfor services to the school
	took ages to get the slime off
	how wasit with lockhartkeeping his voice low so as not to wake neville, dean, and seamus,harry told ron exactly what he had heard
	and lockhart said he couldn't hear it said ron
	harry could seehim frowning in the moonlight
	d'you think he was lying but i don'tget it  even someone invisible would've had to open the door
	i know, said harry, lying back in his fourposter and staring at thecanopy above him
	i don't get it either
	c h a p t e r   e i g h t the deathday partyoctober arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle
	madam pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds amongthe staff and students
	her pepperup potion worked instantly, though it leftthe drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward
	ginny weasley,who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by percy
	thesteam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her wholehead was on fire
	raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days onend the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and hagrid'spumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds
	oliver wood's enthusiasm forregular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why harrywas to be found, late one stormy saturday afternoon a few days beforehalloween, returning to gryffindor tower, drenched to the skin andsplattered with mud
	even aside from the rain and wind it hadn't been a happy practice session
	fred and george, who had been spying on the slytherin team, had seen forthemselves the speed of those new nimbus two thousand and ones
	theyreported that the slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs,shooting through the air like missiles
	as harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebodywho looked just as preoccupied as he was
	nearly headless nick, the ghostof gryffindor tower, was staring morosely out of a window, mutteringunder his breath,
	don't fulfill their requirements
	half an inch, if that
	hello, nick, said harry
	hello, hello, said nearly headless nick, starting and looking round
	hewore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff,which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed
	hewas pale as smoke, and harry could see right through him to the dark skyand torrential rain outside
	you look troubled, young potter, said nick, folding a transparent letter ashe spoke and tucking it inside his doublet
	so do you, said harry
	ah, nearly headless nick waved an elegant hand, a matter of noimportance
	it's not as though i really wanted to join
	thought i'dapply, but apparently i 'don't fulfill requirements' in spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face
	but you would think, wouldn't you, he erupted suddenly, pulling the letterback out of his pocket, that getting hit fortyfive times in the neck with ablunt axe would qualify you to join the headless huntoh  yes, said harry, who was obviously supposed to agree
	i mean, nobody wishes more than i do that it had all been quick and clean,and my head had come off properly, i mean, it would have saved me a greatdeal of pain and ridicule
	however  nearly headless nick shook his letteropen and read furiously 'we can only accept huntsmen whose heads haveparted company with their bodies
	you will appreciate that it would beimpossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such ashorseback headjuggling and head polo
	it is with the greatest regret,therefore, that i must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements
	with very best wishes, sir patrick delaneypodmore
	'fuming, nearly headless nick stuffed the letter away
	half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, harry most peoplewould think that's good and beheaded, but oh, no, it's not enough for sirproperly decapitatedpodmore
	nearly headless nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a farcalmer tone, so  what's bothering you anything i can dono, said harry
	not unless you know where we can get seven freenimbus two thousand and ones for our match against sly the rest of harry's sentence was drowned out by a highpitched mewlingfrom somewhere near his ankles
	he looked down and found himself gazinginto a pair of lamplike yellow eyes
	norris, the skeletal gray catwho was used by the caretaker, argus filch, as a sort of deputy in hisendless battle against students
	you'd better get out of here, harry, said nick quickly
	filch isn't in agood mood  he's got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frogbrains all over the ceiling in dungeon five
	he's been cleaning all morning,and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place right, said harry, backing away from the accusing stare of mrs
	norris,but not quickly enough
	drawn to the spot by the mysterious power thatseemed to connect him with his foul cat, argus filch burst suddenly througha tapestry to harry's right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rulebreaker
	there was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nosewas unusually purple
	filth he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as hepointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from harry's quidditch robes
	mess and muck everywhere i've had enough of it, i tell you follow me,potterso harry waved a gloomy goodbye to nearly headless nick and followedfilch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on thefloor
	harry had never been inside filch's office before it was a place moststudents avoided
	the room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oillamp dangling from the low ceiling
	a faint smell of fried fish lingered aboutthe place
	wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls from their labels,harry could see that they contained details of every pupil filch had everpunished
	fred and george weasley had an entire drawer to themselves
	ahighly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behindfilch's desk
	it was common knowledge that he was always beggingdumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling
	filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling aroundlooking for parchment
	dung, he muttered furiously, great sizzling dragon bogies
	i've had enough of it
	he retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched itout in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the ink pot
	it was only a bit of mud said harry
	it's only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it's an extra hour scrubbingshouted filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose
	befouling the castle
	dabbing at his streaming nose, filch squinted unpleasantly at harry whowaited with bated breath for his sentence to fall
	but as filch lowered his quill, there was a great bang on the ceiling ofthe office, which made the oil lamp rattle
	peeves filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage
	i'llhave you this time, i'll have youand without a backward glance at harry, filch ran flatfooted from theoffice, mrs
	norris streaking alongside him
	peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived tocause havoc and distress
	harry didn't much like peeves, but couldn't helpfeeling grateful for his timing
	hopefully, whatever peeves had done and itsounded as though he'd wrecked something very big this time woulddistract filch from harry
	thinking that he should probably wait for filch to come back, harry sankinto a motheaten chair next to the desk
	there was only one thing on it apartfrom his halfcompleted form a large, glossy, purple envelope with silverlettering on the front
	with a quick glance at the door to check that filchwasn't on his way back, harry picked up the envelope and read kwikspell acorrespondence course in beginners' magic
	intrigued, harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf ofparchment inside
	more curly silver writing on the front page said feel outof step in the world of modern magic find yourself making excuses not toperform simple spells ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork thereis an answer kwikspell is an allnew, failsafe, quickresult, easylearncourse
	hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the kwikspellmethod madam z
	nettles of topsham writes i had no memory forincantations and my potions were a family joke now, after a kwikspellcourse, i am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe ofmy scintillation solution warlock d
	prod of didsbury says my wifeused to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulouskwikspell course and i succeeded in turning her into a yak thank you,kwikspellfascinated, harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope's contents
	whyon earth did filch want a kwikspell course did this mean he wasn't aproper wizard harry was just reading lesson one holding your wandsome useful tips when shuffling footsteps outside told him filch wascoming back
	stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, harry threw itback onto the desk just as the door opened
	filch was looking triumphant
	that vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable he was saying gleefully tomrs
	we'll have peeves out this time, my sweet his eyes fell on harry and then darted to the kwikspell envelope, which,harry realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started
	filch's pasty face went brick red
	harry braced himself for a tidal wave offury
	filch hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw itinto a drawer
	have you  did you read  he sputtered
	no, harry lied quickly
	filch's knobbly hands were twisting together
	if i thought you'd read my private  not that it's mine  for a friend  be thatas it may  however harry was staring at him, alarmed filch had never looked madder
	his eyeswere popping, a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartanscarf didn't help
	very well  go  and don't breathe a word  not that  however, if you didn'tread  go now, i have to write up peeves' report  go amazed at his luck, harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and backupstairs
	to escape from filch's office without punishment was probablysome kind of school record
	harry harry did it worknearly headless nick came gliding out of a classroom
	behind him, harrycould see the wreckage of a large blackandgold cabinet that appeared tohave been dropped from a great height
	i persuaded peeves to crash it right over filch's office, said nick eagerly
	thought it might distract him was that you said harry gratefully
	yeah, it worked, i didn't even getdetention
	thanks, nickthey set off up the corridor together
	nearly headless nick, harry noticed,was still holding sir patrick's rejection letter
	i wish there was something i could do for you about the headless hunt,harry said
	nearly headless nick stopped in his tracks and harry walked right throughhim
	he wished he hadn't it was like stepping through an icy shower
	but there is something you could do for me, said nick excitedly
	harry would i be asking too much  but no, you wouldn't want what is it said harry
	well, this halloween will be my five hundredth deathday, said nearlyheadless nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified
	oh, said harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this
	i'm holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons
	friends will becoming from all over the country
	it would be such an honor if you wouldattend
	weasley and miss granger would be most welcome, too, ofcourse  but i daresay you'd rather go to the school feast he watched harryon tenterhooks
	no, said harry quickly, i'll come my dear boy harry potter, at my deathday party and  he hesitated,looking excited  do you think you could possibly mention to sir patrickhow very frightening and impressive you find meof  of course, said harry
	nearly headless nick beamed at him
	a deathday party said hermionekeenly when harry had changed at last and joined her and ron in thecommon room
	i bet there aren't many living people who can say they'vebeen to one of those  it'll be fascinating
	why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died said ron, whowas halfway through his potions homework and grumpy
	sounds deaddepressing to me
	rain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but insideall looked bright and cheerful
	the firelight glowed over the countlesssquashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, inthe case of fred and george weasley, trying to find out what would happenif you fed a filibuster firework to a salamander
	fred had rescued thebrilliant orange, firedwelling lizard from a care of magical creatures classand it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot ofcurious people
	harry was at the point of telling ron and hermione about filch and thekwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air,emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room
	thesight of percy bellowing himself hoarse at fred and george, the spectaculardisplay of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth, and itsescape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both filch and thekwikspell envelope from harry's mind
	by the time halloween arrived,harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party
	the rest ofthe school was happily anticipating their halloween feast the great hall hadbeen decorated with the usual live bats, hagrid's vast pumpkins had beencarved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there wererumors that dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for theentertainment
	a promise is a promise, hermione reminded harry bossily
	you saidyou'd go to the deathday party
	so at seven o'clock, harry, ron, and hermione walked straight past thedoorway to the packed great hall, which was glittering invitingly with goldplates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons
	the passageway leading to nearly headless nick's party had been linedwith candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful these were long,thin, jetblack tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly lighteven over their own living faces
	the temperature dropped with every stepthey took
	as harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, heheard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormousblackboard
	is that supposed to be music ron whispered
	they turned a corner andsaw nearly headless nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvetdrapes
	my dear friends, he said mournfully
	so pleasedyou could come
	he swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside
	it was an incredible sight
	the dungeon was full of hundreds of pearlywhite,translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor,waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played byan orchestra on a raised, blackdraped platform
	a chandelier overheadblazed midnightblue with a thousand more black candles
	their breath rosein a mist before them it was like stepping into a freezer
	shall we have a look around harry suggested, wanting to warm up hisfeet
	careful not to walk through anyone, said ron nervously, and they set offaround the edge of the dance floor
	they passed a group of gloomy nuns, aragged man wearing chains, and the fat friar, a cheerful hufflepuff ghost,who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead
	harrywasn't surprised to see that the bloody baron, a gaunt, staring slytheringhost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by theother ghosts
	oh, no, said hermione, stopping abruptly
	turn back, turn back, i don'twant to talk to moaning myrtle who said harry as they backtracked quickly
	she haunts one of the toilets in the girls' bathroom on the first floor, saidhermione
	she haunts a toiletyes
	it's been outoforder all year because she keeps having tantrums andflooding the place
	i never went in there anyway if i could avoid it it's awfultrying to have a pee with her wailing at you look, food said ron
	on the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in blackvelvet
	they approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in theirtracks, horrified
	the smell was quite disgusting
	large, rotten fish were laidon handsome silver platters cakes, burned charcoalblack, were heaped onsalvers there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furrygreen mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of atombstone, with tarlike icing forming the words, sir nicholas de mimsyporpingtondied 31st october, 1492harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouchedlow, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed throughone of the stinking salmon
	can you taste it if you walk though it harry asked him
	almost, said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away
	i expect they've let it rot to give it a stronger flavor, said hermioneknowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putridhaggis
	can we move i feel sick, said ron
	they had barely turned around, however, when a little man swoopedsuddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them
	hello, peeves, said harry cautiously
	unlike the ghosts around them, peeves the poltergeist was the very reverseof pale and transparent
	he was wearing a bright orange party hat, arevolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face
	nibbles he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered infungus
	no thanks, said hermione
	heard you talking about poor myrtle, said peeves, his eyes dancing
	rude you was about poor myrtle
	he took a deep breath and bellowed,oy myrtleoh, no, peeves, don't tell her what i said, she'll be really upset, hermionewhispered frantically
	i didn't mean it, i don't mind her  er, hello, myrtle
	the squat ghost of a girl had glided over
	she had the glummest face harryhad ever seen, halfhidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles
	what she said sulkily
	how are you, myrtle said hermione in a falsely bright voice
	it's nice tosee you out of the toilet
	miss granger was just talking about you  said peeves slyly in myrtle'sear
	just saying  saying  how nice you look tonight, said hermione, glaringat peeves
	myrtle eyed hermione suspiciously
	you're making fun of me, she said, silver tears welling rapidly in hersmall, seethrough eyes
	no  honestly  didn't i just say how nice myrtle's looking saidhermione, nudging harry and ron painfully in the ribs
	oh, yeah she did don't lie to me, myrtle gasped, tears now flooding down her face, whilepeeves chuckled happily over her shoulder
	d'you think i don't know whatpeople call me behind my back fat myrtle ugly myrtle miserable,moaning, moping myrtleyou've forgotten pimply, peeves hissed in her ear
	moaning myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon
	peeves shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling, pimplypimplyoh, dear, said hermione sadly
	nearly headless nick now drifted toward them through the crowd
	enjoying yourselvesoh, yes, they lied
	not a bad turnout, said nearly headless nick proudly
	the wailingwidow came all the way up from kent
	it's nearly time for my speech,i'd better go and warn the orchestra
	the orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment
	they, andeveryone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as ahunting horn sounded
	oh, here we go, said nearly headless nick bitterly
	through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by aheadless horseman
	the assembly clapped wildly harry started to clap, too,but stopped quickly at the sight of nick's face
	the horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearingand plunging
	at the front of the pack was a large ghost who held hisbearded head under his arm, from which position he was blowing the horn
	the ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over thecrowd everyone laughed, and strode over to nearly headless nick,squashing his head back onto his neck
	how are you head still hanging in therehe gave a hearty guffaw and clapped nearly headless nick on the shoulder
	welcome, patrick, said nick stiffly
	live 'uns said sir patrick, spotting harry, ron, and hermione and givinga huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again the crowdhowled with laughter
	very amusing, said nearly headless nick darkly
	don't mind nick shouted sir patrick's head from the floor
	still upset wewon't let him join the hunt but i mean to say  look at the fellow i think, said harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from nick, nick's very frightening and  er ha yelled sir patrick's head
	bet he asked you to say thatif i could have everyone's attention, it's time for my speech said nearlyheadless nick loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an icyblue spotlight
	my late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow
	but nobody heard much more
	sir patrick and the rest of the headless hunthad just started a game of head hockey and the crowd were turning towatch
	nearly headless nick tried vainly to recapture his audience, but gaveup as sir patrick's head went sailing past him to loud cheers
	harry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry
	i can't stand much more of this, ron muttered, his teeth chattering, as theorchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dancefloor
	let's go, harry agreed
	they backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who lookedat them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full ofblack candles
	pudding might not be finished yet, said ron hopefully, leading the waytoward the steps to the entrance hall
	and then harry heard it
	it was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard inlockhart's office
	he stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all hismight, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway
	harry, what're you it's that voice again  shut up a minute
	listen said harry urgently, and ron and hermione froze, watching him
	the voice was growing fainter
	harry was sure it was moving away moving upward
	a mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he staredat the dark ceiling how could it be moving upward was it a phantom, towhom stone ceilings didn't matterthis way, he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrancehall
	it was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from thehalloween feast was echoing out of the great hall
	harry sprinted up themarble staircase to the first floor, ron and hermione clattering behind him
	harry, what're we shhharry strained his ears
	distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainterstill, he heard the voice
	i smell bloodhis stomach lurched it's going to kill someone he shouted, and ignoring ron's and hermione'sbewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying tolisten over his own pounding footsteps harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, ron and hermionepanting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last,deserted passage
	harry, what was that all about said ron, wiping sweat off his face
	icouldn't hear anything
	but hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor
	looksomething was shining on the wall ahead
	they approached slowly,squinting through the darkness
	foothigh words had been daubed on thewall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flamingtorches
	the chamber of secrets has been opened
	enemies of the heir,beware
	what's that thing  hanging underneath said ron, a slight quiver in hisvoice
	as they edged nearer, harry almost slipped  there was a large puddle ofwater on the floor ron and hermione grabbed him, and they inched towardthe message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it
	all three of themrealized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash
	norris, the caretaker's cat, was hanging by her tail from the torchbracket
	she was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring
	for a few seconds, they didn't move
	then ron said, let's get out of here
	shouldn't we try and help  harry began awkwardly
	we don't want to be found here
	a rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them thatthe feast had just ended
	from either end of the corridor where they stoodcame the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happytalk of wellfed people next moment, students were crashing into thepassage from both ends
	the chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spottedthe hanging cat
	harry, ron, and hermione stood alone, in the middle of thecorridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to seethe grisly sight
	then someone shouted through the quiet
	enemies of the heir, beware you'll be next, mudbloodsit was draco malfoy
	he had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyesalive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of thehanging, immobile cat
	c h a p t e rn i n ethe wrtiting on the wallwhat's going on here what's going on attracted no doubt bymalfoy's shout, argus filch came shouldering his way through thecrowd
	norris and fell back, clutching his face inhorror
	my cat my cat what's happened to mrs
	and his popping eyes fell on harry
	you you've murdered my cat you'vekilled her i'll kill you i'll argusdumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of otherteachers
	in seconds, he had swept past harry, ron, and hermioneand detached mrs
	norris from the torch bracket
	come with me, argus, he said to filch
	weasley, miss granger
	lockhart stepped forward eagerly
	my office is nearest, headmaster  just upstairs  please feel free thank you, gilderoy, said dumbledore
	the silent crowd parted to let them pass
	lockhart, looking excited andimportant, hurried after dumbledore so did professors mcgonagalland snape
	as they entered lockhart's darkened office there was a flurry ofmovement across the walls harry saw several of the lockharts in thepictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers
	the real lockhart litthe candles on his desk and stood back
	norrison the polished surface and began to examine her
	harry, ron, andhermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the poolof candlelight, watching
	the tip of dumbledore's long, crooked nose was barely an inch frommrs
	he was looking at her closely through his halfmoonspectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking
	professormcgonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed
	snapeloomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiarexpression it was as though he was trying hard not to smile
	andlockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions
	it was definitely a curse that killed her  probably the transmogrifiantorture  i've seen it used many times, so unlucky i wasn't there, iknow the very countercurse that would have saved her
	lockhart's comments were punctuated by filch's dry, racking sobs
	he was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at mrs
	norris,his face in his hands
	much as he detested filch, harrycouldn't help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry ashe felt for himself if dumbledore believed filch, he would be expelledfor sure
	dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath andtapping mrs
	norris with his wand but nothing happened shecontinued to look as though she had been recently stuffed
	i remember something very similar happening in ouagadogou,said lockhart, a series of attacks, the full story's in myautobiography, i was able to provide the townsfolk with variousamulets, which cleared the matter up at once
	the photographs of lockhart on the walls were all nodding inagreement as he talked
	one of them had forgotten to remove his hairnet
	at last dumbledore straightened up
	she's not dead, argus, he said softly
	lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number ofmurders he had prevented
	not dead choked filch, looking through his fingers at mrs
	but why's she all  all stiff and frozenshe has been petrified, said dumbledore ah i thought so saidlockhart
	but how, i cannot say
	ask him shrieked filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face toharry
	no second year could have done this, said dumbledore firmly
	itwould take dark magic of the most advanced he did it, he did it filch spat, his pouchy face purpling
	you sawwhat he wrote on the wall he found  in my office  he knows i'm a i'm a  filch's face worked horribly
	he knows i'm a squib hefinished
	norris harry said loudly, uncomfortablyaware of everyone looking at him, including all the lockharts on thewalls
	and i don't even know what a squib is
	rubbish snarled filch
	he saw my kwikspell letterif i might speak, headmaster, said snape from the shadows, andharry's sense of forboding increased he was sure nothing snape hadto say was going to do him any good
	potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at thewrong time, he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though hedoubted it
	but we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here
	why was he in the upstairs corridor at all why wasn't he at thehalloween feastharry, ron and hermione all launched into an explanation about thedeathday party
	there were hundreds of ghosts, theyll tell you we werethere but why not join the feast afterward said snape, his black eyesglittering in the candlelight
	why go up to that corridorron and hermione looked at harry
	because  because  harry said, his heart thumping very fastsomething told him it would sound very farfetched if he told them hehad been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear,because we were tired and wanted to go to bed, he said
	without any supper said snape, a triumphant smile flickering acrosshis gaunt face
	i didn't think ghosts provided food fit for living peopleat their parties
	we weren't hungry, said ron loudly as his stomach gave a hugerumble
	snape's nasty smile widened
	i suggest, headmaster, that potter is not being entirely truthful, hesaid
	it might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privilegesuntil he is ready to tell us the whole story
	i personally feel he shouldbe taken off the gryffindor quidditch team until he is ready to behonest
	really, severus, said professor mcgonagall sharply, i see noreason to stop the boy playing quidditch
	this cat wasn't hit over thehead with a broomstick
	there is no evidence at all that potter hasdone anything wrong
	dumbledore was giving harry a searching look
	his twinkling lightblue gaze made harry feel as though he were being xrayed
	innocent until proven guilty, severus, he said firmly
	my cat has been petrified he shrieked, his eyes popping
	i want tosee some punishmentwe will be able to cure her, argus, said dumbledore patiently
	professer sprout recently managed to procure some mandrakes
	assoon as they have reached their full size, i will have a potion made thatwill revive mrs
	i'll make it, lockhart butted in
	i must have done it a hundred times
	i could whip up a mandrake restorative draught in my sleep excuse me, said snape icily
	but i believe i am the potions masterat this school
	there was a very awkward pause
	you may go, dumbledore said to harry, ron, and hermione
	they went, as quickly as they could without actually running
	whenthey were a floor up from lockhart's office, they turned intoan empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them
	harrysquinted at his friends' darkened faces
	d'you think i should have told them about that voice i heardno, said ron, without hesitation
	hearing voices no one else canhear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world
	something in ron's voice made harry ask, you do believe me, don'tyou'course i do, said ron quickly
	but you must admit it's weird
	i know it's weird, said harry
	the whole thing's weird
	what wasthat writing on the wall about the cbamber has been opened
	what's that supposed to meanyou know, it rings a sort of bell, said ron slowly
	i think someonetold me a story about a secret chamber at hogwarts once
	and what on earth's a squib said harry
	to his surprise, ron stifled a snigger
	well  it's not funny really  but as it's filch, he said
	a squib issomeone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got anymagic powers
	kind of the opposite of muggleborn wizards, butsquibs are quite unusual
	if filch's trying to learn magic from akwikspell course, i reckon he must be a squib
	it would explain a lot
	like why he hates students so much
	ron gave a satisfied smile
	a clock chimed somewhere
	we'd better get to bed before snape comesalong and tries to frame us for something else
	for a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack onmrs
	filch kept it fresh in everyone's minds by pacing the spotwhere she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker mightcome back
	harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wallwith mrs
	skower's allpurpose magical mess remover, but to noeffect the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone
	whenfilch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking redeyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students andtrying to put them in detention for things like breathing loudly' andlooking happy
	ginny weasley seemed very disturbed by mrs
	according to ron, she was a great cat lover
	but you haven't really got to know mrs
	norris, ron told herbracingly
	honestly, we're much better off without her
	stuff like this doesn't often happen at hogwarts, ronassured her
	they'll catch the maniac who did it and have him out ofhere in no time
	i just hope he's got time to petrify filch before he'sexpelled
	i'm only joking  ron added hastily as ginny blanched
	the attack had also had an effect on hermione
	it was quite usual forhermione to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doingalmost nothing else
	nor could harry and ron get much responsefrom her when they asked what she was up to, and not until thefollowing wednesday did they find out
	harry had been held back in potions, where snape had made him staybehind to scrape tubeworms off the desks
	after a hurried lunch, hewent upstairs to meet ron in the library, and saw justin finchfletchley, the hufflepuff boy from herbology, comingtoward him
	harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when justincaught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the oppositedirection
	harry found ron at the back of the library, measuring his history ofmagic homework
	professor binns had asked for a threefootlongcomposition on the medieval assembly of european wizards
	i don't believe it, i'm still eight inches short said ron furiously, letting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll
	and hermione's done four feet seven inches and her writing'stiny
	where is she asked harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrollinghis own homework
	somewhere over there, said ron, pointing along the shelves
	lookingfor another book
	i think she's trying to read the whole library beforechristmas
	harry told ron about justin finchfletchley running away from him
	i thought he was a bit of an idiot, said ron,scribbling away, making his writing as large as possible
	all that junkabout lockhart being so great hermione emerged from between the bookshelves
	she looked irritableand at last seemed ready to talk to them
	all the copies of hogwarts, a history have been taken out, she said,sitting down next to harry and ron
	and there's a twoweek waitinglist
	i wish i hadn't left my copy at home, but i couldn't fit it in my trunkwith all the lockhart books
	why do you want it said harry
	the same reason everyone else wants it, said hermione, to readup on the legend of the chamber of secrets
	what's that said harry quickly
	i can't remember, said hermione, biting her lip
	andi can't find the story anywhere else hermione, let me read your composition, said ron desperately,checking his watch
	no, i won't, said hermione, suddenly severe
	you've had tendays to finish it i only need another two inches, come on the bell rang
	ron and hermione led the way to history of magic,bickering
	history of magic was the dullest subject on their schedule
	professorbinns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the mostexciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering theroom through the blackboard
	ancient and shriveled, many peoplesaid he hadn't noticed he was dead
	he had simply got up to teachone day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of thestaff room fire his routine had not varied in the slightest since
	today was as boring as ever
	professor binns opened his notes andbegan to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearlyeveryone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming tolong enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again
	he had been speaking for half an hour when something happenedthat had never happened before
	hermione put up her hand
	professor binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the international warlock convention of 1289, looked amazed
	miss  er granger, professor
	i was wondering if you could tell us anythingabout the chamber of secrets, said hermione in a clear voice
	dean thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open,gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance lavender brown'shead came up off her arms and neville longbottom's elbow slippedoff his desk
	professor binns blinked
	my subject is history of magic, he said in his dry, wheezy voice
	ideal with facts, miss granger, not myths and legends
	he cleared histhroat with a small noise like chalk sping and continued, inseptember of that year, a subcommittee of sardinian sorcerershe stuttered to a halt
	hermione's hand was waving in the air again
	miss grantplease, sir, don't legends always have a basis in factprofessor binns was looking at her in such amazement, harry wassure no student had ever interrupted him before, alive or dead
	well, said professor binns slowly, yes, one could argue that, isuppose
	he peered at hermione as though he had never seen astudent properly before
	however, the legend of which you speak issuch a very sensational, even ludicrous tale but the whole class was now hanging on professor binns's everyword
	he looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his
	harrycould tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show ofinterest
	oh, very well, he said slowly
	the chamber ofsecrets
	you all know, of course, that hogwarts was founded over a thousandyears ago  the precise date is uncertain  by the four greatest witchesand wizards of the age
	the four school houses are named afterthem godric gryffindor, helga hufflepuff, rowena ravenclaw, andsalazar slytherin
	they built this castle together, far from pryingmuggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by commonpeople, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution
	he paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued
	for a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seekingout youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to thecastle to be educated
	but then disagreements sprang up betweenthem
	a rift began to grow between slytherin and the others
	slytherinwished to be more selective about the students admitted to hogwarts
	hebelieved that magical learning should be kept within allmagic families
	he disliked taking students of muggle parentage, believing them to beuntrustworthy
	after a while, there was a serious argument on thesubject between slytherin and gryffindor, and slytherin left theschool
	professor binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkledold tortoise
	reliable historical sources tell us this much, he said
	but thesehonest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of thechamber of secrets
	the story goes that slytherin had built ahidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knewnothing
	slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the chamber of secretsso that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived atthe school
	the heir alone would be able to unseal the chamber ofsecrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school ofall who were unworthy to study magic
	there was silence as he finished telling the story, but it wasn't theusual, sleepy silence that filled professor binns's classes
	there wasunease in the air as everyone continued to watch him, hoping formore
	professor binns looked faintly annoyed
	the whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course, he said
	naturally,the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, manytimes, by the most learned witches and wizards
	atale told to frighten the gullible
	hermione's hand was back in the air
	sir  what exactly do you mean by the horror within' thechamberthat is believed to be some sort of monster, which the heir ofslytherin alone can control, said professor binns in his dry, reedyvoice
	the class exchanged nervous looks
	i tell you, the thing does not exist, said professor binns, shuffling hisnotes
	there is no chamber and no monster
	but, sir, said seamus finnigan, if the chamber can only be openedby slytherin's true heir, no one else would be able to find it, wouldtheynonsense, o'flaherty, said professor binns in an aggravatedtone
	if a long succession of hogwarts headmasters andheadmistresses haven't found the thing but, professor, piped up parvati patil, you'd probably have to usedark magic to open it just because a wizard doesn't use dark magic doesn't mean hecan't, miss pennyfeather, snapped professor binns
	i repeat, if thelikes of dumbledore but maybe you've got to be related to slytherin, so dumbledorecouldn't  began dean thomas, but professor binns had hadenough
	that will do, he said sharply
	it is a myth it does not exist thereis not a shred of evidence that slytherin ever built so much as asecret broom cupboard i regret telling you such a foolish story wewill return, if you please, to history, to solid, believable, verifiablefactand within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor
	i always knew salazar slytherin was a twisted old loony, ron toldharry and hermione as they fought their way through the teemingcorridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags beforedinner
	but i never knew he started all this pureblood stuff
	iwouldn't be in his house if you paid me
	honestly, if the sorting hathad tried to put me in slytherin, i'd've got the train straight backhome
	hermione nodded fervently, but harry didn't say anything
	hisstomach had just dropped unpleasantly
	harry had never told ron and hermione that the sorting hathad seriously considered putting him in slytherin
	he could remember,as though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his earwhen he'd placed the hat on his head a year before you could be great,you know, it's all here in your head, and slytherin would help you on theway to greatness, no doubt about that
	but harry, who had already heard of slytherin house's reputation for turning out dark wizards, had thought desperately, notslytherin and the hat had said, oh, well, if you're sure
	as they were shunted along in the throng, colin creevy went past
	hiya, harryhullo, colin, said harry automatically
	harry  harry  a boy in my class has been saying you'rebut colin was so small he couldnt fight against the tide of peoplebearing him toward the great hall they heard him squeak, see you,harry and he was gone
	what's a boy in his class saying about you hermione wondered
	that i'm slytherin's heir, i expect, said harry, his stomach droppinganother inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way justin finchfletchley had run away from him at lunchtime
	people here'll believe anything, said ron in disgust
	the crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircasewithout difficulty
	d'you really think there's a chamber of secrets ron askedhermione
	i don't know, she said, frowning
	dumbledore couldn't curemrs
	norris, and that makes me think that whatever attacked hermight not be  well  human
	as she spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the endof the very corridor where the attack had happened
	they stoppedand looked
	the scene was just as it had been that night, except thatthere was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and an emptychair stood against the wall bearing the message the chamber ofsecrets has been opened
	that's where filch has been keeping guard, ron muttered
	they looked at each other
	the corridor was deserted
	can't hurt to have a poke around, said harry, dropping his bag andgetting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along, searchingfor clues
	here  and here come and look at this said hermione
	harry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on thewall
	hermione was pointing at the topmost pane, where aroundtwenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through asmall crack
	a long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, as thoughthey had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside
	have you ever seen spiders act like that said hermionewonderingly
	no, said harry, have you, ron ronhe looked over his shoulder
	ron was standing well back and seemedto be fighting the impulse to run
	i  don't  like  spiders, said ron tensely
	i never knew that, said hermione, looking at ron in surprise
	you've used spiders in potions loads of times
	i don't mind them dead, said ron, who was carefully lookinganywhere but at the window
	i just don't like the way they move
	it's not funny, said ron, fiercely
	if you must know, when i wasthree, fred turned my  my teddy bear into a great big fiithy spiderbecause i broke his toy broomstick
	you wouldn't like them either ifyou'd been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and
	he broke off, shuddering
	hermione was obviously still trying not tolaugh
	feeling they had better get off the subject, harry said,remember all that water on the floor where did that come fromsomeone's mopped it up
	it was about here, said ron, recovering himself to walk a few pacespast filch's chair and pointing
	level with this door
	he reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand asthough he'd been burned
	what's the matter said harry
	can't go in there, said ron gruffly
	that's a girls' toilet
	oh, ron, there won't be anyone in there, said hermione, standing upand coming over
	that's moaning myrtle's place
	come on, let's havea look
	and ignoring the large out of order sign, she opened the door
	it was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom harry had ever setfoot in
	under a large, cracked, and spotted mirror were a row ofchipped sinks
	the floor was damp and reflected the dull light givenoff by the stubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders thewooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one ofthem was dangling off its hinges
	hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall
	when she reached it she said, hello, myrtle, how are youharry and ron went to look
	moaning myrtle was floating above thetank of the toilet, picking a spot on her chin
	this is a girls' bathroom, she said, eyeing ron and harry suspiciously
	i just wanted to show them how er  nice it isin here
	she waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor
	ask her if she saw anything, harry mouthed at hermione
	what are you whispering said myrtle, staring at him
	nothing, said harry quickly
	we wanted to ask i wish people would stop talking behind my back said myrtle, in avoice choked with tears
	i do have feelings, you know, even if i amdead myrtle, no one wants to upset you, said hermione
	harry only no one wants to upset me that's a good one howled myrtle
	mylife was nothing but misery at this place and now people come alongruining my deathwe wanted to ask you if you've seen anything funny lately, saidhermione quickly
	because a cat was attacked right outside yourfront door on halloween
	did you see anyone near here that night said harry
	i wasn't paying attention, said myrtle dramatically
	peeves upset meso much i came in here and tried to kill myself then, of course, iremembered that i'm  that i'm already dead, said ron helpfully
	myrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and divedheadfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishingfrom sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she hadcome to rest somewhere in the ubend
	harry and ron stood with their mouths open, but hermione shruggedwearily and said, honestly, that was almost cheerful for myrtle
	harry had barely closed the door on myrtle's gurgling sobs when aloud voice made all three of them jump
	ronpercy weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefectbadge agleam, an expression of complete shock on his face
	that's a girls' bathroom he gasped
	what were you just having a look around, ron shrugged
	clues, you know percy swelled in a manner that reminded harry forcefully of mrs
	get  away  from  there  perry said, striding toward them andstarting to bustle them along, flapping his arms
	don't you care whatthis looks like coming back here while everyone's at dinner why shouldn't we be here said ron hotly, stopping short and glaringat percy
	listen, we never laid a finger on that catthat's what i told ginny, said percy fiercely, but she still seems tothink you're going to be expelled, i've never seen her so upset, cryingher eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughlyoverexcited by this business you don't care about ginny, said ron, whose ears were nowreddening
	you're just worried i'm going to mess up your chances ofbeing head boy five points from gryffindor percy said tersely, fingering his prefectbadge
	and i hope it teaches you a lesson no more detective work, ori'll write to mumand he strode off, the back of his neck as red as ron's ears
	harry, ron, and hermione chose seats as far as possible from percyin the common room that night
	ron was still in a very bad temper andkept blotting his charms homework
	when he reached absently for hiswand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment
	fuming almostas much as his homework, ron slammed the standard book of spells,grade 2 shut
	to harry's surprise, hermione followed suit
	who can it be, though she said in a quiet voice, as thoughcontinuing a conversation they had just been having
	who'd want tofrighten all the squibs and muggleborns out of hogwartslet's think, said ron in mock puzzlement
	who do we know whothinks muggleborns are scumhe looked at hermione
	hermione looked back, unconvinced
	if you're talking about malfoy of course i am said ron
	you heard him  you'll be next,mudbloods' come on, you've only got to look at his foul rat face toknow it's him malfoy, the heir of slytherin said hermione skeptically
	look at his family, said harry, closing his books, too
	the whole lotof them have been in slytherin he's always boasting about it
	theycould easily be slytherin's descendants
	his father's definitely evilenough
	they couldve had the key to the chamber of secrets for centuriessaid ron
	handing it down, father to son
	well, said hermione cautiously, i suppose it's possible
	but how do we prove it said harry darkly
	there might be a way, said hermione slowly, dropping her voice stillfurther with a quick glance across the room at percy
	of course, itwould be difficult
	and dangerous, very dangerous
	we'd be breakingabout fifty school rules, i expect if, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know,won't you said ron irritably
	all right, said hermione coldly
	what we'd need to do is to getinside the slytherin common room and ask malfoy a few questionswithout him realizing it's us
	but that's impossible, harry said as ron laughed
	no, it's not, said hermione
	all we'd need would be some polyjuicepotion
	what's that said ron and harry together
	snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago d'you think we've got nothing better to do in potions than listen tosnape muttered ron
	it transforms you into somebody else
	think about it we couldchange into three of the slytherins
	no one would know it was us
	malfoy would probably tell us anything
	he's probably boasting about itin the slytherin common room right now, if only we could hear him
	this polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me, said ron, frowning
	what if we were stuck looking like three of the slytherins foreverit wears off after a while, said hermione, waving her handimpatiently
	but getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult
	snape said it was in a book called moste potente potions and it'sbound to be in the restricted section of the library
	there was only one way to get out a book from the restrictedsection you needed a signed note of permission from a teacher
	hard to see why we'd want the book, really, said ron, if weweren't going to try and make one of the potions
	i think, said hermione, that if we made it sound as thoughwe were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chance
	oh, come on, no teacher's going to fall for that, said ron
	they'd have to be really thick
	c h a p t e rt e nthe rogue bludgersince the disastrous episode of the pixies, professor lockhart had notbrought live creatures to class
	instead, he read passages from hisbooks to them, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramaticbits
	he usually picked harry to help him with these reconstructionsso far, harry had been forced to play a simple transylvanian villagerwhom lockhart had cured of a babbling curse, a yeti with a headcold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything exceptlettuce since lockhart had dealt with him
	harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very nextdefense against the dark arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf ifhe hadn't had a very good reason for keeping lockhart in a goodmood, he would have refused to do it
	nice loud howl, harry  exactly  and then, if you'll believe it, ipounced  like this  slammed him to the floor  thus with one hand, imanaged to hold him down  with my other, iput my wand to his throat i then screwed up my remaining strengthand performed the immensely complex homorphus charm  he letout a piteous moan  go on, harry  higher than that  good  the furvanished  the fangs shrank  and he turned back into a man
	simple,yet effective  and another village will remember me forever as thehero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolfattacks
	the bell rang and lockhart got to his feet
	homework  compose a poem about my defeat of the waggawagga werewolf signed copies of magical me to the author of thebest onethe class began to leave
	harry returned to the back of the room,where ron and hermione were waiting
	wait till everyone's gone, said hermione nervously
	she approached lockhart's desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly inher hand, harry and ron right behind her
	er  professor lockhart hermione stammered
	i wanted to  toget this book out of the library
	just for background reading
	sheheld out the piece of paper, her hand shaking slightly
	but the thingis, it's in the restricted section of the library, so i need a teacher tosign for it  i'm sure it would help me understand what you say ingadding with ghouls about slowacting venomsah, gadding with ghouls said lockhart, taking the note fromhermione and smiling widely at her
	possibly my very favoritebook
	you enjoyed itoh, yes, said hermione eagerly
	so clever, the way you trapped thatlast one with the teastrainer well, i'm sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the yeara little extra help, said lockhart warmly, and he pulled out anenormous peacock quill
	yes, nice, isn't it he said, misreading therevolted look on ron's face
	i usually save it for booksignings
	he scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed itback to hermione
	so, harry, said lockhart, while hermione folded the note withfumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag
	tomorrow's the firstquidditch match of the season, i believe gryffindor against slytherin,is it not i hear you're a useful player
	i wasasked to try for the national squad, but preferred to dedicate my lifeto the eradication of the dark forces
	still, if ever you feel the needfor a little private training, don't hesitate to ask
	always happy to passon my expertise to less able players
	harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off afterron and hermione
	i don't believe it, he said as the three of them examined the signatureon the note
	he didn't even look at the book we wanted
	that's because he's a brainless git, said ron
	but who cares, we'vegot what we needed he is not a brainless git, said hermione shrilly as they half rantoward the library
	just because he said you were the best student of the year they dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of thelibrary
	madam pince, the librarian, was a thin, irritable woman wholooked like an underfed vulture
	moste potente potions she repeated suspiciously, trying to take thenote from hermione but hermione wouldn't let go
	i was wondering if i could keep it, she said breathlessly
	oh, come on, said ron, wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting itat madam pince
	we'll get you another autograph
	lockhart'll signanything if it stands still long enough
	madam pince held the note up to the light, as though determined todetect a forgery, but it passed the test
	she stalked away between thelofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large andmoldylooking book
	hermione put it carefully into her bag and theyleft, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty
	five minutes later, they were barricaded in moaning myrtle's outoforder bathroom once again
	hermione had overridden ron's objectionsby pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right mindswould go, so they were guaranteed some privacy
	moaning myrtlewas crying noisily in her stall, but they were ignoring her, and shethem
	hermione opened moste potente potions carefully, and the three ofthem bent over the dampspotted pages
	it was clear from a glancewhy it belonged in the restricted section
	some of the potions hadeffects almost too gruesome to think about, and there were some veryunpleasant illustrations, which included a man who seemed to havebeen turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs ofarms out of her head
	here it is, said hermione excitedly as she found the page headed thepolyjuice potion
	it was decorated with drawings of people halfwaythrough transforming into other people
	harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on theirfaces
	this is the most complicated potion i've ever seen, said hermione asthey scanned the recipe
	lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, andknotgrass, she murmured, running her finger down the list ofingredients
	well, they're easy enough, they're in the student storecupboard, we can help ourselves
	oooh, look, powdered horn of abicorn  don't know where we're going to get that  shredded skin of aboomslang
	that'll be tricky, too and of course a bit of whoever wewant to change into
	excuse me said ron sharply
	what d'you mean, a bit of whoeverwe're changing into i'm drinking nothing with crabbe's toenails in it hermione continued as though she hadn't heard him
	we don't have to worry about that yet, though, because we add thosebits last
	ron turned, speechless, to harry, who had another worry
	d'you realize how much we're going to have to steal, hermioneshredded skin of a boomslang, that's definitely not in the students'cupboard
	what're we going to do, break into snape's private stores idon't know if this is a good idea
	hermione shut the book with a snap
	well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine, she said
	there werebright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter thanusual
	i don't want to break rules, you know
	i think threateningmuggleborns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion
	but ifyou don't want to find out if it's malfoy, i'll go straight to madam pincenow and hand the book back in 'i never thought id see the day when you'd be persuading us tobreak rules, said ron
	all right, we'll do it
	but not toenails, okayhow long will it take to make, anyway said harry as hermione,looking happier, opened the book again
	well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon andthe lacewings have got to be stewed for twentyone days
	i'd sayit'd be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients
	malfoy could have attacked half the muggleborns in the school by then but hermione's eyes narroweddangerously again, and he added swiftly, but it's the best plan we'vegot, so full steam ahead, i say
	however, while hermione was checking that the coast was clear forthem to leave the bathroom, ron muttered to harry, it'll be a lot lesshassle if you can just knock malfoy off his broom tomorrow
	harry woke early on saturday morning and lay for a while thinkingabout the coming quidditch match
	he was nervous, mainly at thethought of what wood would say if gryffindor lost, but also at theidea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms goldcould buy
	he had never wanted to beat slytherin so badly
	afterhalf an hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got up,dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where he found the restof the gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty table, all lookinguptight and not speaking much
	as eleven o'clock approached, the whole school started to make itsway down to the quidditch stadium
	it was a muggy sort of daywith a hint of thunder in the air
	ron and hermione came hurryingover to wish harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms
	theteam pulled on their scarlet gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen towood's usual prematch pep talk
	slytherin has better brooms than us, he began
	but we've got better people on our brooms
	we've trained harder thanthey have, we've been flying in all weathers  too true, mutteredgeorge weasley
	i haven't been properly dry since august  andwe're going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime,malfoy, buy his way onto their team
	chest heaving with emotion, wood turned to harry
	it'll be down to you, harry, to show them that a seeker has to havesomething more than a rich father
	get to that snitch before malfoy ordie trying, harry, because we've got to win today, we've got to
	so no pressure, harry said fred, winking at him
	as they walked out onto the pitch, a roar of noise greeted them mainlycheers, because ravenclaw and hufflepuff were anxious to seeslytherin beaten, but the slytherins in the crowd made their boos andhisses heard, too
	madam hooch, the quidditch teacher, asked flintand wood to shake hands, which they did, giving each otherthreatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary
	on my whistle, said madam hooch
	with a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteenplayers rose toward the leaden sky
	harry flew higher than any ofthem, squinting around for the snitch
	all right there, scarhead yelled malfoy, shooting underneath him asthough to show off the speed of his broom
	harry had no time to reply
	at that very moment, a heavy blackbludger came pelting toward him he avoided it so narrowly that hefelt it ruffle his hair as it passed
	close one, harry said george, streaking past him with his club in hishand, ready to knock the bludger back toward a slytherin
	harry sawgeorge give the bludger a powerful whack in the direction of adrianpucey, but the bludger changed direction in midair and shot straightfor harry again
	harry dropped quickly to avoid it, and george managed to hit it hardtoward malfoy
	once again, the bludger swerved like a boomerangand shot at harry's head
	harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of thepitch
	he could hear the bludger whistling along behind him
	whatwas going on bludgers never concentrated on one player like this itwas their job to try and unseat as many people as possible
	fred weasley was waiting for the bludger at the other end
	harryducked as fred swung at the bludger with all his might the bludgerwas knocked off course
	gotcha fred yelled happily, but he was wrong as though it wasmagnetically attracted to harry, the bludger pelted after him oncemore and harry was forced to fly off at full speed
	it had started to rain harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face,splattering onto his glasses
	he didn't have a clue what was going onin the rest of the game until he heard lee jordan, who wascommentating, say, slytherin lead, sixty points to zero 'the slytherins' superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, andmeanwhile the mad bludger was doing all it could to knock harryout of the air
	fred and george were now flying so close to him oneither side that harry could see nothing at all except their flailing armsand had no chance to look for the snitch, let alone catch it
	someone's  tampered  with  this  bludger  fred grunted,swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack onharry
	we need time out, said george, trying to signal to wood and stopthe bludger breaking harry's nose at the same time
	wood had obviously got the message
	madam hooch's whistle rangout and harry, fred, and george dived for the ground, still trying toavoid the mad bludger
	what's going on said wood as the gryffindor team huddledtogether, while slytherins in the crowd jeered
	we're beingflattened
	fred, george, where were you when that bludger stoppedangelina scoringwe were twenty feet above her, stopping the other bludger frommurdering harry, oliver, said george angrily
	someone's fixed it it won't leave harry alone
	it hasn't gone for anyone else all game
	the slytherins must have done something to it
	but the bludgers have been locked in madam hooch's office sinceour last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then
	said wood, anxiously
	madam hooch was walking toward them
	over her shoulder, harrycould see the slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction
	listen, said harry as she came nearer and nearer, with you twoflying around me all the time the only way i'm going to catch thesnitch is if it flies up my sleeve
	go back to the rest of the team andlet me deal with the rogue one
	don't be thick, said fred
	it'll take your head off
	wood was looking from harry to the weasleys
	i oliver, this is insane, said alicia spinner angrily
	you can't let harrydeal with that thing on his own
	let's ask for an inquiry if we stop now, we'll have to forfeit the match said harry
	andwe're not losing to slytherin just because of a crazy bludger comeon, oliver, tell them to leave me alonethis is all your fault, george said angrily to wood
	get the snitchor die trying,' what a stupid thing to tell him madam hooch had joined them
	ready to resume play she asked wood
	wood looked at the determined look on harry's face
	fred, george, you heard harry leave him aloneand let him deal with the bludger on his own
	the rain was falling more heavily now
	on madam hooch's whistle,harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of thebludger behind him
	higher and higher harry climbed he looped andswooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled
	slightly dizzy, he neverthelesskept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up hisnostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from thebludger
	he could hear laughter from the crowd he knew he mustlook very stupid, but the rogue bludger was heavy and couldn't changedirection as quickly as harry could he began a kind of rollercoasterride around theedges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to thegryffindor goal posts, where adrian pucey was trying to get pastwooda whistling in harry's ear told him the bludger had just missed himagain he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction
	training for the ballet, potter yelled malfoy as harry was forced todo a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the bludger, and he fled, thebludger trailing a few feet behind him and then, glaring back atmalfoy in hatred, he saw it  the golden snitch
	it was hovering inchesabove malfoy's left ear  and malfoy, busy laughing at harry, hadn'tseen it
	for an agonizing moment, harry hung in midair, not daring to speedtoward malfoy in case he looked up and saw the snitch
	he had stayed still a second too long
	the bludger had hit him at last,smashed into his elbow, and harry felt his arm break
	dimly, dazed bythe searing pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his raindrenchedbroom, one knee still crooked over it, his right arm dangling useless athis side  the bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this timewming at his face  harry swerved out of the way, one idea firmlylodged in his numb brain get to malfoy
	through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering, sneeringface below him and saw its eyes widen with fear malfoy thoughtharry was attacking him
	what the  he gasped, careening out of harry's way
	harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatchhe felt his fingers close on the cold snitch but was now onlygripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowdbelow as he headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to passout
	with a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom
	hisarm was hanging at a very strange angle riddled with pain, he heard,as though from a distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting
	hefocused on the snitch clutched in his good hand
	he came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, withsomeone leaning over him
	he saw a glitter of teeth
	oh, no, not you, he moaned
	doesn't know what he's saying, said lockhart loudly to the anxiouscrowd of gryffindors pressing around them
	i'm about to fix your arm
	i'll keep it like this, thanks
	he tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible
	he heard a familiarclicking noise nearby
	i don't want a photo of this, colin, he said loudly
	lie back, harry, said lockhart soothingly
	it's a simple charm i'veused countless times why can't i just go to the hospital wing said harry throughclenched teeth
	he should really, professor, said a muddy wood, who couldn'thelp grinning even though his seeker was injured
	great capture,harry, really spectacular, your best yet, id say through the thicket of legs around him, harry spotted fred andgeorge weasley, wrestling the rogue bludger into a box
	it was stillputting up a terrific fight
	stand back, said lockhart, who was rolling up his jadegreensleeves
	no  don't  said harry weakly, but lockhart was twirling his wandand a second later had directed it straight at harry's arm
	a strange and unpleasant sensation started at harry's shoulder andspread all the way down to his fingertips
	it felt as though his arm wasbeing deflated
	he didn't dare look at what was happening
	he hadshut his eyes, his face turned away from his arm, but his worst fearswere realized as the people above him gasped and colin creeveybegan clicking away madly
	his arm didn't hurt anymore  nor did itfeel remotely like an arm
	well, that can sometimes happen
	but thepoint is, the bones are no longer broken
	that's the thing to bear inmind
	so, harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing  ah, mr
	weasley,miss granger, would you escort him  and madam pomfrey will beable to  er  tidy you up a bit
	as harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided
	taking a deepbreath he looked down at his right side
	what he saw nearly made himpass out again
	poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, fleshcolored rubber glove
	he tried to move his fingers
	lockhart hadn't mended harry's bones
	madam pomfrey wasn't at all pleased
	you should have come straight to me she raged, holding upthe sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been aworking arm
	i can mend bones in a second  but growing them back you will be able to, won't you said harry desperately
	i'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful, said madam pomfreygrimly, throwing harry a pair of pajamas
	you'll have to stay thenight
	hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around harry's bed whileron helped him into his pajamas
	it took a while to stuff the rubbery,boneless arm into a sleeve
	how can you stick up for lockhart now, hermione, eh ron calledthrough the curtain as he pulled harry's limp fingers through the cuff
	if harry had wanted deboning he would have asked
	anyone can make a mistake, said hermione
	and it doesn't hurtanymore, does it, harryno, said harry, getting into bed
	but it doesn't do anything elseeither
	as he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped pointlessly
	hermione and madam pomfrey came around the curtain
	madampomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled skelegro
	you're in for a rough night, she said, pouring out a steamingbeakerful and handing it to him
	regrowing bones is a nasty business
	so was taking the skelegro
	it burned harry's mouth and throat as itwent down, making him cough and splutter
	still tuttutting aboutdangerous sports and inept teachers, madam pomfrey retreated, leaving ron and hermione to help harry gulp down somewater
	we won, though, said ron, a grin breaking across his face
	that was some catch you made
	he looked readyto kill
	i want to know how he fixed that bludger, said hermionedarkly
	we can add that to the list of questions we'll ask him whenwe've taken the polyjuice potion, said harry, sinking back ontohis pillows
	i hope it tastes better than this stuff
	if it's got bits of slytherins in it you've got to be joking, saidron
	the door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment
	filthyand soaking wet, the rest of the gryffindor team had arrived to seeharry
	unbelievable flying, harry, said george
	i've just seen marcus flint yelling at malfoy
	something about having the snitch ontop of his head and not noticing
	malfoy didn't seem too happy
	they had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juicethey gathered around harry's bed and were just getting started onwhat promised to be a good party when madam pomfrey camestorming over, shouting, this boy needs rest, he's got thirtythreebones to regrow out outand harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him from thestabbing pains in his limp arm
	hours and hours later, harry woke quite suddenly in the pitchblackness and gave a small yelp of pain his arm now felt full oflarge splinters
	for a second, he thought that was what had wokenhim
	then, with a thrill of horror, he realized that someone wassponging his forehead in the dark
	get off he said loudly, and then, dobbythe houseelf's goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at harrythrough the darkness
	a single tear was running down his long,pointed nose
	harry potter came back to school, he whispered miserably
	dobby warned and warned harry potter
	ah sir, why didn't youheed dobby why didn't harry potter go back home when hemissed the trainharry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed dobby's spongeaway
	what're you doing here he said
	and how did you know i missedthe traindobby's lip trembled and harry was seized by a sudden suspicion
	it was you he said slowly
	you stopped the barrier from letting usthroughindeed yes, sir, said dobby, nodding his head vigorously, earsflapping
	dobby hid and watched for harry potter and sealed thegateway and dobby had to iron his hands afterward  he showedharry ten long, bandaged fingers  but dobby didn't care, sir, for hethought harry potter was safe, and never did dobby dream that harrypotter would get to school another wayhe was rocking backward and forward, shaking his ugly head
	dobby was 'so shocked when he heard harry potter was back athogwarts, he let his master's dinner burn such a flogging dobbynever had, sir
	harry slumped back onto his pillows
	you nearly got ron and me expelled, he said fiercely
	you'd betterget lost before my bones come back, dobby, or i might strangle you
	dobby is used to death threats, sir
	dobby gets them five times a dayat home
	he blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore, lookingso pathetic that harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself
	why d'you wear that thing, dobby he asked curiously
	this, sir said dobby, plucking at the pillowcase
	'tis a mark of thehouseelf's enslavement, sir
	dobby can only be freed if his masterspresent him with clothes, sir
	the family is careful not to pass dobbyeven a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their houseforever
	dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly, harry potter mustgo home dobby thought his bludger would be enough to make your bludger said harry, anger rising once more
	what d'youmean, your bludger you made that bludger try and kill menot kill you, sir, never kill you said dobby, shocked
	dobby wantsto save harry potter's life better sent home, grievously injured, thanremain here sir dobby only wanted harry potter hurt enough to besent homeoh, is that all said harry angrily
	i don't suppose you're going totell me why you wanted me sent home in piecesah, if harry potter only knew dobby groaned, more tears drippingonto his ragged pillowcase
	if he knew what he meansto us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we dregs of the magical worlddobby remembers how it was when hewhomustnotbenamedwas at the height of his powers, sir we houseelfs were treated likevermin, sir of course, dobby is still treated like that, sir, he admitted,drying his face on the pillowcase
	but mostly, sir, life has improvedfor my kind since you triumphed over hewhomustnotbenamed
	harry potter survived, and the dark lord's power was broken, and itwas a new dawn, sir, and harry potter shone like a beacon of hopefor those of us who thought the dark days would never end, sit
	andnow, at hogwarts, terrible things are to happen, are perhaps happeningalready, and dobby cannot let harry potter stay here now that historyis to repeat itself, now that the chamber of secrets is open once moredobby froze, horrorstruck, then grabbed harry's water jug from hisbedside table and cracked it over his own head, toppling out of sight
	asecond later, he crawled back onto the bed, crosseyed, muttering,bad dobby, very bad dobby
	so there is a chamber of secrets harry whispered
	and did yousay it's been opened before tell me, dobbyhe seized the elf's bony wrist as dobby's hand inched toward thewater jug
	but i'm not muggleborn  how can i be in danger from thechamberah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor dobby, stammered the elf,his eyes huge in the dark
	dark deeds are planned in this place, butharry potter must not be here when they happen  go home, harrypotter, go home
	harry potter must not meddle in this, sir, 'tis toodangerous who is it, dobby harry said, keeping a firm hold on dobby'swrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again
	who'sopened it who opened it last timedobby can't, sir, dobby can't, dobby mustn't tell squealed the elf
	go home, harry potter, go homei'm not going anywhere said harry fiercely
	one of my bestfriends is muggleborn she'll be first in line if the chamber really hasbeen opened harry potter risks his own life for his friends moaned dobby in akind of miserable ecstasy
	so noble so valiant but he must savehimself, he must, harry potter must not dobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering
	there were footsteps coming down the passageway outside
	dobby must go breathed the elf, terrified
	there was a loud crack,and harry's fist was suddenly clenched on thin air
	he slumped backinto bed, his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as thefootsteps drew nearer
	next moment, dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, wearing along woolly dressing gown and a nightcap
	he was carrying one endof what looked like a statue
	professor mcgonagall appeared asecond later, carrying its feet
	together, they heaved it onto a bed
	get madam pomfrey, whispered dumbledore, and professormcgonagall hurried past the end of harry's bed out of sight
	harry layquite still, pretending to be asleep
	he heard urgent voices, and thenprofessor mcgonagall swept back into view, closely followed bymadam pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress
	he heard a sharp intake of breath
	what happened madam pomfrey whispered to dumbledore,bending over the statue on the bed
	another attack, said dumbledore
	minerva found him on the stairs
	there was a bunch of grapes next to him, said professormcgonagall
	we think he was trying to sneak up here to visit potter
	harry's stomach gave a horrible lurch
	slowly and carefully, he raisedhimself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed
	a rayof moonlight lay across its staring face
	his eyes were wide and his hands were stuckup in front of him, holding his camera
	petrified whispered madam pomfrey
	yes, said professor mcgonagall
	but i shudder to think
	if albushadn't been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate  who knowswhat might have the three of them stared down at colin
	then dumbledore leanedforward and wrenched the camera out of colin's rigid grip
	you don't think he managed to get a picture of his attacker saidprofessor mcgonagall eagerly
	dumbledore didn't answer
	he opened the back of the camera
	good gracious said madam pomfrey
	a jet of steam had hissed out of the camera
	harry, three beds away,caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic
	melted, said madam pomfrey wonderingly
	what does this mean, albus professor mcgonagall askedurgently
	it means, said dumbledore, that the chamber of secrets is indeedopen again
	madam pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth
	professor mcgonagallstared at dumbledore
	whothe question is not who, said dumbledore, his eyes on colin
	the question is, how
	and from what harry could see of professor mcgonagall's shadowy face, she didn't understand this any better than he did
	c h a p t e re l e v e nthe dueling clubharry woke up on sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing withwinter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff
	he sat up quicklyand looked over at colin's bed, but it had been blocked from view bythe high curtains harry had changed behind yesterday
	seeing that hewas awake, madam pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast trayand then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers
	all in order, she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge lefthanded
	when you've finished eating, you may leave
	harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to gryffindortower, desperate to tell ron and hermione about colin and dobby,but they weren't there
	harry left to look for them, wondering wherethey could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren'tinterested in whether he had his bones back or not
	as harry passed the library, percy weasley strolled out of it,looking in far better spirits than last time they'd met
	oh, hello, harry, he said
	excellent flying yesterday, reallyexcellent
	gryffindor has just taken the lead for the house cup youearned fifty pointsyou haven't seen ron or hermione, have you said harry
	no, i haven't, said percy, his smile fading
	i hope ron's not inanother girls' toilet
	harry forced a laugh, watched percy walk out of sight, and thenheaded straight for moaning myrtle's bathroom
	he couldn't see whyron and hermione would be in there again, but after making surethat neither filch nor any prefects were around, he opened the doorand heard their voices coming from a locked stall
	it's me, he said, closing the door behind him
	there was a clunk, asplash, and a gasp from within the stall and he saw hermione's eyepeering through the keyhole
	you gave us such a fright  come in how's yourarmfine, said harry, squeezing into the stall
	an old cauldron wasperched on the toilet, and a crackling from under the rim told harrythey had lit a fire beneath it
	conjuring up portable, waterproof fireswas a speciality of hermione's
	we'd've come to meet you, but we decided to get started on thepolyjuice potion, ron explained as harry, with difficulty, locked thestall again
	we've decided this is the safest place to hide it
	harry started to tell them about colin, but hermione interrupted
	we already know  we heard professor mcgonagall tellingprofessor flitwick this morning
	that's why we decided we'd better getgoing the sooner we get a confession out of malfoy, the better, snarledron
	d'you know what i think he was in such a foul temper afterthe quidditch match, he took it out on colin
	there's something else, said harry, watching hermione tearingbundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion
	dobby cameto visit me in the middle of the night
	ron and hermione looked up, amazed
	harry told them everythingdobby had told him  or hadn't told him
	hermione and ron listenedwith their mouths open
	the chamber of secrets has been opened before hermione said
	this settles it, said ron in a triumphant voice
	lucius malfoy must'veopened the chamber when he was at school here and now he's tolddear old draco how to do it
	wish dobby'd told you whatkind of monster's in there, though
	i want to know how come nobody'snoticed it sneaking around the school
	maybe it can make itself invisible, said hermione, prodding leeches tothe bottom of the cauldron
	or maybe it can disguise itself  pretend tobe a suit of armor or something  i've read about chameleon ghouls you read too much, hermione, said ron, pouring dead lacewings ontop of the leeches
	he crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and lookedat harry
	so dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm
	you know what, harry if he doesn'tstop trying to save your life he's going to kill you
	the news that colin creevey had been attacked and was now lyingas though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entireschool by monday morning
	the air was suddenly thick with rumorand suspicion
	the first years were now moving around the castle intightknit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if theyventured forth alone
	ginny weasley, who sat next to colin creevey in charms, wasdistraught, but harry felt that fred and george were going thewrong way about cheering her up
	they were taking turns coveringthemselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behindstatues
	they only stopped when percy, apoplectic with rage, toldthem he was going to write to mrs
	weasley and tell her ginny washaving nightmares
	meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans,amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school
	neville longbottom bought a large, evilsmelling green onion, apointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the othergryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger he was a pureblood, and therefore unlikely to be attacked
	they went for filch first, neville said, his round face fearful
	andeveryone knows i'm almost a squib
	in the second week of december professor mcgonagall camearound as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying atschool for christmas
	harry, ron, and hermione signed her list theyhad heard that malfoy was staying, which struck them as verysuspicious
	the holidays would be the perfect time to use thepolyjuice potion and try to worm a confession out of him
	unfortunately, the potion was only half finished
	they stillneeded the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only placethey were going to get them was from snape's private stores
	harryprivately felt he'd rather face slytherin's legendary monster than letsnape catch him robbing his office
	what we need, said hermione briskly as thursday afternoon'sdouble potions lesson loomed nearer, is a diversion
	then one of uscan sneak into snape's office and take what we need
	harry and ron looked at her nervously
	i think id better do the actual stealing, hermione continued in amatteroffact tone
	you two will be expelled if you get into any moretrouble, and i've got a clean record
	so all you need to do is causeenough mayhem to keep snape busy for five minutes or so
	deliberately causing mayhem in snape's potionsclass was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye
	potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons
	thursdayafternoon's lesson proceeded in the usual way
	twenty cauldronsstood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brassscales and jars of ingredients
	snape prowled through the fumes,making waspish remarks about the gryffindors' work while theslytherins sniggered appreciatively
	draco malfoy, who was snape'sfavorite student, kept flicking pufferfish eyes at ron and harry, whoknew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than youcould say unfair
	harry's swelling solution was far too runny, but he had his mind onmore important things
	he was waiting for hermione's signal, and hehardly listened as snape paused to sneer at his waterypotion
	when snape turned and walked off to bully neville, hermionecaught harry's eye and nodded
	harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of fred'sfilibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with hiswand
	the firework began to fizz and sputter
	knowing he had onlyseconds, harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air itlanded right on target in goyle's cauldron
	goyle's potion exploded, showering the whole class
	people shriekedas splashes of the swelling solution hit them
	malfoy got a faceful andhis nose began to swell like a balloon goyle blundered around, hishands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened
	through the confusion, harry saw hermione slip quietly into snape'soffice
	silence silence snape roared
	anyone who has been splashed,come here for a deflating draft  when i find out who did this harry tried not to laugh as he watched malfoy hurry forward, his headdrooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon
	as half theclass lumbered up to snape's desk, some weighted down with armslike clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffedup lips, harrysaw hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robesbulging
	when everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellingshad subsided, snape swept over to goyle's cauldron and scooped outthe twisted black remains of the firework
	there was a sudden hush
	if i ever find out who threw this, snape whispered, i shall makesure that person is expelled
	harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzledexpression
	snape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang tenminutes later could not have been more welcome
	he knew it was me, harry told ron and hermione as they hurriedback to moaning myrtle's bathroom
	hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began tostir feverishly
	it'll be ready in two weeks, she said happily
	snape can't prove it was you, said ron reassuringly to harry
	what can he doknowing snape, something foul, said harry as the potion frothedand bubbled
	a week later, harry, ron, and hermione were walking across theentrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered aroundthe notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just beenpinned up
	seamus finnigan and dean thomas beckoned themover, looking excited
	they're starting a dueling club said seamus
	first meetingtonight i wouldn't mind dueling lessons they might come in handyone of these days
	what, you reckon slytherin's monster can duel said ron, but he,too, read the sign with interest
	could be useful, he said to harry and hermione as they went intodinner
	shall we goharry and hermione were all for it, so at eight o'clock thatevening they hurried back to the great hall
	the long dining tableshad vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit bythousands of candles floating overhead
	the ceiling was velvetyblack once more and most of the school seemed to be packedbeneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited
	i wonder who'll be teaching us said hermione as they edged intothe chattering crowd
	someone told me flitwick was a duelingchampion when he was young  maybe it'll be him
	as long as it's not  harry began, but he ended on a groangilderoy lockhart was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robesof deep plum and accompanied by none other than snape, wearinghis usual black
	lockhart waved an arm for silence and called ' gather round,gather round can everyone see me can you all hear meexcellentnow, professor dumbledore has granted me permission to startthis little dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defendyourselves as i myself have done on countless occasions  for fulldetails, see my published works
	let me introduce my assistant, professor snape, said lockhart,flashing a wide smile
	he tells me he knows a tiny little bit aboutdueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a shortdemonstration before we begin
	now, i don't want any of youyoungsters to worry  you'll still have your potions master when i'mthrough with him, never fearwouldn't it be good if they finished each other off ron muttered inharry's ear
	snape's upper lip was curling
	harry wondered why lockhartwas still smiling if snape had been looking at him like that he'd havebeen running as fast as he could in the opposite direction
	lockhart and snape turned to face each other and bowed at least,lockhart did, with much twirling of his hands, whereas snape jerkedhis head irritably
	then they raised their wands like swords in front ofthem
	as you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combativeposition, lockhart told the silent crowd
	on the count of three, wewill cast our first spells
	neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course
	i wouldn't bet on that, harry murmured, watching snape baring histeeth
	one  two  three both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed themat their opponent snape cried expelliarmus there was a dazzlingflash of scarlet light and lockhart was blasted off his feet he flewbackward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it tosprawl on the floor
	malfoy and some of the other slytherins cheered
	hermione wasdancing on tiptoes
	do you think he's all right she squealed throughher fingers
	who cares said harry and ron together
	lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet
	his hat had fallen off andhis wavy hair was standing on end
	well, there you have it he said, tottering back onto the platform
	that was a disarming charm  as you see, i've lost my wand  ah,thank you, miss brown  yes, an excellent idea to show them that,professor snape, but if you don't mind my sayingso, it was very obvious what you were about to do
	if i had wanted tostop you it would have been only too easy  however, i felt it would beinstructive to let them see
	snape was looking murderous
	possibly lockhart had noticed, becausehe said, enough demonstrating i'm going to come amongst you nowand put you all into pairs
	professor snape, if you'd like to help me they moved through the crowd, matching up partners
	lockhartteamed neville with justin finchfletchley, but snape reached harryand ron first
	time to split up the dream team, i think, he sneered
	weasley, youcan partner finnigan
	potter harry moved automatically toward hermione
	i don't think so, said snape, smiling coldly
	malfoy, come overhere
	let's see what you make of the famous potter
	and you, missgranger  you can partner miss bulstrode
	malfoy strutted over, smirking
	behind him walked a slytherin girl whoreminded harry of a picture he'd seen in holidays with hags
	she waslarge and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively
	hermionegave her a weak smile that she did not return
	face your partners called lockhart, back on the platform
	andbowharry and malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes offeach other
	wands at the ready shouted lockhart
	when i count to three, castyour charms to disarm your opponents  only to disarm them  we don'twant any accidents  one
	three harry swung his wand high, but malfoy had already started on twohis spell hit harry so hard he felt as though he'd been hit over thehead with a saucepan
	he stumbled, but everything still seemed to beworking, and wasting no more time, harry pointed his wand straight atmalfoy and shouted, rictusempraa jet of silver light hit malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up,wheezing
	i said disarm only lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of thebattling crowd, as malfoy sank to his knees harry had hit him with atickling charm, and he could barely move for laughing
	harry hungback, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch malfoywhile he was on the floor, but this was a mistake gasping for breath,malfoy pointed his wand at harry's knees, choked, tarantallegraand the next second harry's legs began to jerk around out of hiscontrol in a kind of quickstep
	stop stop screamed lockhart, but snape took charge
	finite incantatem he shouted harry's feet stopped dancing, malfoystopped laughing, and they were able to look up
	a haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene
	both nevilleand justin were lying on the floor, panting ron was holding up anashenfaced seamus, apologizing for whatever his broken wand haddone but hermione and millicent bulstrode were still movingmillicent had hermione in a headlock and hermione was whimperingin pain both their wands lay forgotten on the floor
	harry leaptforward and pulled millicent off
	it was difficult she was a lot biggerthan he was
	dear, dear, said lockhart, skittering through the crowd, looking atthe aftermath of the duels
	up you go, macmillan
	careful there, miss fawcett
	pinch it hard, it'll stop bleeding in asecond, booti think id better teach you how to block unfriendly spells, saidlockhart, standing flustered in the midst of the hall
	he glanced atsnape, whose black eyes glinted, and looked quickly away
	let'shave a volunteer pair  longbottom and finchfletchley, how aboutyou a bad idea, professor lockhart, said snape, gliding over like a largeand malevolent bat
	longbottom causes devastation with the simplestspells
	we'll be sending what's left of finchfletchley up to thehospital wing in a matchbox
	neville's round, pink face went pinker
	how about malfoy and potter said snape with a twisted smile
	excellent idea said lockhart, gesturing harry and malfoy into themiddle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room
	now, harry, said lockhart
	when draco points his wand at you,you do this
	he raised his own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wigglingaction, and dropped it
	snape smirked as lockhart quickly picked it up,saying, whoops my wand is a little overexcited snape moved closer to malfoy, bent down, and whispered somethingin his ear
	harry looked up nervously at lockhartand said, professor, could you show me that blocking thing againscared muttered malfoy, so that lockhart couldn't hear him
	you wish, said harry out of the corner of his mouth
	lockhart cuffed harry merrily on the shoulder
	just do what i did,harrywhat, drop my wandbut lockhart wasn't listening
	three  two  one  go he shouted
	malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed, serpensortiathe end of his wand exploded
	harry watched, aghast, as a long blacksnake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, andraised itself, ready to strike
	there were screams as the crowdbacked swiftly away, clearing the floor
	don't move, potter, said snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight ofharry standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake
	allow me shouted lockhart
	he brandished his wand at the snakeand there was a loud bang the snake, instead of vanishing, flew tenfeet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack
	enraged,hissing furiously, it slithered straight toward justin finchfletchley andraised itself again, fangs exposed, poised to strike
	harry wasn't sure what made him do it
	he wasn't even aware ofdeciding to do it
	all he knew was that his legs were carrying himforward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidlyat the snake, leave him alone and miraculously  inexplicably  thesnake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, itseyes now on harry
	harry felt the fear drain out of him
	he knew thesnake wouldn't attack anyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn'thave explained
	he looked up at justin, grinning, expecting to see justin lookingrelieved, or puzzled, or even grateful  but certainly not angry andscared
	what do you think you're playing at he shouted, and before harrycould say anything, justin had turned and stormed out of the hall
	snape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the snake vanished in asmall puff of black smoke
	snape, too, was looking at harry in anunexpected way it was a shrewd and calculating look, and harrydidn't like it
	he was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering allaround the walls
	then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes
	come on, said rods voice in his ear
	move  come on ron steered him out of the hall, hermione hurrying alongside them
	asthey went through the doors, the people on either side drew away asthough they were frightened of catching something
	harry didn't havea clue what was going on, and neither ron nor hermione explainedanything until they had dragged him all the way up to the emptygryffindor common room
	then ron pushed harry into an armchairand said, you're a parselmouth
	why didn't you tell usi'm a what said harry
	a parselmouth said ron
	you can talk to snakesi know, said harry
	i mean, that's only the second time i've everdone it
	i accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin dudley at thezoo once  long story  but it was telling me it had never seen braziland i sort of set it free without meaning to that was before i knew iwas a wizard a boa constrictor told you it had never seen brazil ron repeatedfaintly
	i bet loads of people here can do it
	oh, no they can't, said ron
	it's not a very common gift
	what's bad said harry, starting to feel quite angry
	what's wrongwith everyone listen, if i hadn't told that snake not to attack justin oh, that's what you said to itwhat d'you mean you were there  you heard me i heard you speaking parseltongue, said ron
	youcould have been saying anything  no wonder justin panicked, yousounded like you were egging the snake on or something  it wascreepy, you know harry gaped at him
	i spoke a different language but  i didn't realize  how can i speaka language without knowing i can speak itron shook his head
	both he and hermione were looking as thoughsomeone had died
	harry couldn't see what was so terrible
	d'you want to tell me what's wrong with stopping a massive snakebiting off justin's head he said
	what does it matter how i did it aslong as justin doesn't have to join the headless huntit matters, said hermione, speaking at last in a hushed voice,because being able to talk to snakes was what salazar slytherin wasfamous for
	that's why the symbol of slytherin house is a serpent
	harry's mouth fell open
	and now the whole school's going to think you'rehis greatgreatgreatgreatgrandson or something but i'm not, said harry, with a panic he couldn't quite explain
	you'll find that hard to prove, said hermione
	he lived about athousand years ago for all we know, you could be
	harry lay awake for hours that night
	through a gap in the curtainsaround his fourposter he watched snow starting to drift past thetower window and wondered
	could he be a descendant of salazar slithering he didn't knowanything about his father's family, after all
	the dursleys had alwaysforbidden questions about his wizarding relatives
	quietly, harry tried to say something in parseltongue
	the wordswouldn't come
	it seemed he had to be facetoface with a snake todo it
	but i'm in gryffindor, harry thought
	the sorting hat wouldn'thave put me in here if i had slytherin blood
	ah, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the sorting hat wanted toput you in slytherin, don't you rememberharry turned over
	he'd see justin the next day in herbology and he'dexplain that he'd been calling the snake off, not egging it on, which hethought angrily, pummeling his pillow any fool should have realized
	by next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night hadturned into a blizzard so thick that the last herbology lesson of theterm was canceled professor sprout wanted to fit socks and scarveson the mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else,now that it was so important for the mandrakes to grow quickly andrevive mrs
	norris and colin creevey
	harry fretted about this next to the fire in the gryffindor commonroom, while ron and hermione used their time off to play a game ofwizard chess
	for heaven's sake, harry, said hermione, exasperated, as oneof ron's bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him offthe board
	go and find justin if it's so important to you
	so harry got up and left through the portrait hole, wondering wherejustin might be
	the castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of thethick, swirling gray snow at every window
	shivering, harry walkedpast classrooms where lessons were taking place, catching snatches ofwhat was happening within
	professor mcgonagall was shouting atsomeone who, by the sound of it, had turned his friend into a badger
	resisting the urge to take a look, harry walked on by, thinking thatjustin might be using his free time to catch up on some work, anddeciding to check the library first
	a group of the hufliepuffs who should have been in herbology wereindeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn't seem to beworking
	between the long lines of high bookshelves, harry could seethat their heads were close together and they were having what lookedlike an absorbing conversation
	he couldn't see whether justin wasamong them
	he was walking toward them when something of whatthey were saying met his ears, and he paused to listen, hidden in theinvisibility section
	so anyway, a stout boy was saying, i told justin to hide up in ourdormitory
	i mean to say, if potter's marked him down as his nextvictim, it's best if he keeps a low profile for a while
	of course, justin'sbeen waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip topotter he was muggleborn
	justin actually told him he'd been downfor eton
	that's not the kind of thing you bandy about with slytherin'sheir on the loose, is ityou definitely think it is potter, then, ernie said a girl with blondepigtails anxiously
	hannah, said the stout boy solemnly, he's a parselmouth
	everyoneknows that's the mark of a dark wizard
	have you ever heard of adecent one who could talk to snakes they called slytherin himselfserpenttongue
	there was some heavy murmuring at this, and ernie went on,remember what was written on the wall enemies of the heir,beware
	potter had some sort of runin with filch
	next thing weknow, flich's cat's attacked
	that first year, creevey, was annoyingpotter at the quidditch match, taking pictures of him while he waslying in the mud
	next thing we know  creevey's been attacked
	he always seems so nice, though, said hannah uncertainly, and,well, he's the one who made youknowwho disappear
	he can't beall bad, can heernie lowered his voice mysteriously, the hufflepuffs bent closer, andharry edged nearer so that he could catch ernie's words
	no one knows how he survived that attack by youknowwho
	imean to say, he was only a baby when it happened
	he should havebeen blasted into smithereens
	only a really powerful dark wizardcould have survived a curse like that
	he dropped his voice until itwas barely more than a whisper, and said, that's probably why youknowwho wanted to kill him in the first place
	didn't want anotherdark lord competing with him
	i wonder what other powers potter'sbeen hidingharry couldn't take anymore
	clearing his throat loudly, he stepped outfrom behind the bookshelves
	if he hadn't been feeling so angry, hewould have found the sight that greeted him funny every one of thehufflepuffs looked as though they had been petrified by the sight ofhim, and the color was draining out of ernie's face
	i'm looking for justin finchfletchley
	the hufepuffs' worst fears had clearly been confirmed
	they alllooked fearfully at ernie
	what do you want with him said ernie in a quavering voice
	i wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at thedueling club, said harry
	ernie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep breath, said, wewere all there
	we saw what happened
	then you noticed that after i spoke to it, the snake backed offsaid harry
	all i saw, said ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as hespoke, was you speaking parseltongue and chasing the snaketoward justin
	i didn't chase it at him harry said, his voice shaking with anger
	itdidn't even touch himit was a very near miss, said ernie
	and in case you're gettingideas, he added hastily, i might tell you that you can trace myfamily back through nine generations of witches and warlocks andmy blood's as pure as anyone's, so i don't care what sort of blood you've got said harry fiercely
	why would i want to attack mugglebornsi've heard you hate those muggles you live with, said ernie swiftly
	it's not possible to live with the dursleys and not hate them, saidharry
	id like to see you try it
	he turned on his heel and stormed out of the library, earning himselfa reproving glare from madam pince, who was polishing the gildedcover of a large spellbook
	harry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where he was going,he was in such a fury
	the result was that he walked into somethingvery large and solid, which knocked him backward onto the floor
	oh, hello, hagrid, harry said, looking up
	hagrid's face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snowcoveredbalaclava, but it couldn't possibly be anyone else, as he filled most ofthe corridor in his moleskin overcoat
	a dead rooster was hangingfrom one of his massive, gloved hands
	all righ', harry he said, pulling up the balaclava so he couldspeak
	why aren't yeh in classcanceled, said harry, getting up
	what're you doing in herehagrid held up the limp rooster
	second one killed this term, he explained
	it's either foxes or abloodsuckin bugbear, an' i need the headmaster's permission terput a charm around the hen coop
	he peered more closely at harry from under his thick, snowfleckedeyebrows
	yeh sure yeh're all righ' yeh look all hot an' bothered harry couldn't bring himself to repeat what ernie and the rest of thehufflepuffs had been saying about him
	it's nothing, he said
	id better get going, hagrid, it's transfigurationnext and i've got to pick up my books
	he walked off, his mind still full of what ernie had said about him
	justin's been waiting for something like this to happen ever since helet slip to potter he was muggleborn
	harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor,which was particularly dark the torches had been extinguished by astrong, icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane
	hewas halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong oversomething lying on the floor
	he turned to squint at what he'd fallen over and felt as though hisstomach had dissolved
	justin finchfletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look ofshock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling
	next to him was another figure, the strangest sightharry had ever seen
	it was nearly headless nick, no longer pearlywhite andtransparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal,six inches off the floor
	his head was half off and his face wore anexpression of shock identical to justin's
	harry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart doing akind of drumroll against his ribs
	he looked wildly up and down thedeserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as theycould away from the bodies
	the only sounds were the muffledvoices of teachers from the classes on either side
	he could run, and no one would ever know he had been there
	buthe couldn't just leave them lying here
	would anyone believe he hadn't had anything to do with thisas he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him opened with abang
	peeves the poltergeist came shooting out
	why, it's potty wee potter cackled peeves, knocking harry'sglasses askew as he bounced past him
	what's potter up to why'spotter lurking peeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault
	upside down,he spotted justin and nearly headless nick
	he flipped the rightway up, filled his lungs and, before harry could stop him, screamed,attack attack another attack no mortalor ghost is safe run for your livesattaaaackcrash  crash  crash  door after door flew open along the corridorand people flooded out
	for several long minutes, there was a sceneof such confusion that justin was in danger of being squashed andpeople kept standing in nearly headless nick
	harry found himselfpinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet
	professormcgonagall came running, followed by her own class, one of whomstill had blackandwhitestriped hair
	she used her wand to set offaloud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back intotheir classes
	no sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than erniethe hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene
	caught in the act ernie yelled, his face stark white, pointing hisfinger dramatically at harry
	that will do, macmillan said professor mcgonagall sharply
	peeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying thescene peeves always loved chaos
	as the teachers bent over justinand nearly headless nick, examining them, peeves broke into songoh, potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done,you're killing off' students, you think it's good fun that's enough peeves barked professor mcgonagall, and peeveszoomed away backward, with his tongue out at harry
	justin was carried up to the hospital wing by professor flitwick andprofessor sinistra of the astronomy department, but nobody seemedto know what to do for nearly headless nick
	in the end, professormcgonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air, which she gave toernie with instructions to waft nearly headless nick up the stairs
	this ernie did, fanning nick along like a silent black hovercraft
	thisleft harry and professor mcgonagall alone together
	this way, potter, she said
	professor, said harry at once, i swear i didn't this is out of my hands, potter, said professor mcgonagall curtly
	they marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before alarge and extremely ugly stone gargoyle
	this was evidently a password, because thegargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behindhim split in two
	even full of dread for what was coming, harrycouldn't fail to be amazed
	behind the wall was a spiral staircase thatwas moving smoothly upward, like an escalator
	as he and professormcgonagall stepped onto it, harry heard the wall thud closed behindthem
	they rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last,slightly dizzy, harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brassknocker in the shape of a griffin
	he knew now where he was being taken
	this must be wheredumbledore lived
	c h a p t e rt w e l v ethe polyjuice potionthey stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and professormcgonagall rapped on the door
	it opened silently and they entered
	professor mcgonagall told harry to wait and left him there, alone
	one thing was certain of all the teachers'offices harry had visited so far this year, dumbledore's was by farthe most interesting
	if he hadn't been scared out of his wits that hewas about to be thrown out of school, he would have been verypleased to have a chance to look around it
	it was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises
	anumber of curious silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tables,whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke
	the walls were coveredwith portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whomwere snoozing gently in their frames
	there was also an enormous,clawfooted desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tatteredwizard's hat  the sorting hat
	he cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches andwizards on the walls
	surely it couldn't hurt if he took the hat downand tried it on again just to see
	just to make sure it had put him inthe right househe walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, andlowered it slowly onto his head
	it was much too large and slippeddown over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he'd put it on
	harry stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting
	then a small voicesaid in his ear, bee in your bonnet, harry potterer, yes, harry muttered
	er  sorry to bother you  i wanted to ask you've been wondering whether i put you in the right house, saidthe hat smartly
	you were particularly difficult to place
	but istand by what i said before  harry's heart leapt  you would havedone well in slytherin harry's stomach plummeted
	he grabbed the point of the hat andpulled it off
	it hung limply in his hand, grubby and faded
	harrypushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick
	you're wrong, he said aloud to the still and silent hat
	harry backed away, watching it
	then a strange, gagging noise behindhim made him wheel around
	he wasn't alone after all
	standing on a golden perch behind the doorwas a decrepitlooking bird that resembled a halfplucked turkey
	harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making itsgagging noise again
	harry thought it looked very ill
	its eyes were dulland, even as harry watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail
	harry was just thinking that all he needed was for dumbledore'spet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it, when the birdburst into flames
	harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk
	he lookedfeverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere butcouldn't see one the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball it gaveone loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smoulderingpile of ash on the floor
	the office door opened
	dumbledore came in, looking very somber
	professor, harry gasped
	your bird  i couldn't do anything  he justcaught fire to harry's astonishment, dumbledore smiled
	about time, too, he said
	he's been looking dreadful for days i'vebeen telling him to get a move on
	he chuckled at the stunned look on harry's face
	fawkes is a phoenix, harry
	phoenixes burst into flame when it istime for them to die and are reborn from the ashes
	harry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird pokeits head out of the ashes
	it was quite as ugly as the old one
	it's a shame you had to see him on a burning day, said dumbledore,seating himself behind his desk
	he's really very handsome most ofthe time, wonderful red and gold plumage
	fascinating creatures,phoenixes
	they can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears havehealing powers, and they make highly faithful pets
	in the shock of fawkes catching fire, harry had forgotten what hewas there for, but it all came back to him as dumbledore settledhimself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed harry with hispenetrating, lightblue stare
	before dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door ofthe office flew open with an almighty bang and hagrid burst in, a wildlook in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black headand the dead rooster still swinging from his hand
	it wasn' harry, professor dumbledore said hagrid urgently
	i wastalkin' ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir dumbledore tried to say something, but hagrid went ranting on,waving the rooster around in his agitation, sending featherseverywhere
	it can't've bin him, i'll swear it in front o' the ministry o' magic if ihave to hagrid, i  yeh've got the wrong boy, sir, i know harry never 'hagrid said dumbledore loudly
	i do not think that harryattacked those people
	oh, said hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side
	i'll waitoutside then, headmaster
	and he stomped out looking embarrassed
	you don't think it was me, professor harry repeated hopefully asdumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk
	no, harry, i don't, said dumbledore, though his face was somberagain
	but i still want to talk to you
	harry waited nervously while dumbledore considered him, the tips ofhis long fingers together
	i must ask you, harry, whether there is anything you'd like to tell me,he said gently
	harry didn't know what to say
	he thought of malfoy shouting, you'llbe next, mudbloods and of the polyjuice potion simmering away inmoaning myrtle's bathroom
	then he thought of the disembodiedvoice he had heard twice and remembered what ron had saidhearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in thewizarding world
	he thought, too, about what everyone was sayingabout him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connectedwith salazar slytherin
	there isn't anything, professor
	the double attack on justin and nearly headless nick turned whathad hitherto been nervousness into real panic
	curiously, it was nearlyheadless nick's fate that seemed to worry people most
	what couldpossibly do that to a ghost people asked each other what terriblepower could harm someone who was already dead there wasalmost a stampede to book seats on the hogwarts express so thatstudents could go home for christmas
	at this rate, we'll be the only ones left, ron told harry andhermione
	us, malfoy, crabbe, and goyle
	what a jolly holiday it'sgoing to be
	crabbe and goyle, who always did whatever malfoy did, had signedup to stay over the holidays, too
	but harry was glad that most peoplewere leaving
	he was tired of people skirting around him in thecorridors, as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison tiredof all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed
	fred and george, however, found all this very funny
	they went out oftheir way to march ahead of harry down the corridors, shouting,make way for the heir of slytherin, seriously evil wizard comingthrough
	percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior
	it is not a laughing matter, he said coldly
	oh, get out of the way, percy, said fred
	yeah, he's off to the chamber of secrets for a cup of tea with hisfanged servant, said george, chortling
	ginny didn't find it amusing either
	oh, don't, she wailed every time fred asked harry loudly who hewas planning to attack next, or when george pretended to ward harryoff with a large clove of garlic when they met
	harry didn't mind it made him feel better that fred and george, atleast, thought the idea of his being slytherin's heir was quite ludicrous
	but their antics seemed to be aggravating draco malfoy, who lookedincreasingly sour each time he saw them at it
	it's because he's bursting to say it's really him, said ron knowingly
	you know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you'regetting all the credit for his dirty work
	not for long, said hermione in a satisfied tone
	the polyjuicepotion's nearly ready
	we'll be getting the truth out of him any daynow
	at last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the groundsdescended on the castle
	harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy,and enjoyed the fact that he, hermione, and the weasleys had the runof gryffindor tower, which meant they couldplay exploding snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practicedueling in private
	fred, george, and ginny had chosen to stay atschool rather than visit bill in egypt with mr
	percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior,didn't spend much time in the gryffindor common room
	he hadalready told them pompously that he was only staying over christmasbecause it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers duringthis troubled time
	christmas morning dawned, cold and white
	harry and ron, the onlyones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by hermione,who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both
	wake up, she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window
	hermione  you're not supposed to be in here  said ron, shieldinghis eyes against the light
	merry christmas to you, too, said hermione, throwing him hispresent
	i've been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings tothe potion
	harry sat up, suddenly wide awake
	are you surepositive, said hermione, shifting scabbers the rat so that she couldsit down on the end of ron's fourposter
	if we're going to do it, isay it should be tonight
	at that moment, hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a verysmall package in her beak
	hello, said harry happily as she landed on his bed
	are youspeaking to me againshe nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a farbetter present than the one that she had brought him, which turnedout to be from the dursleys
	they had sent harry a toothpick and anote telling him to find out whether he'd be able to stay at hogwartsfor the summer vacation, too
	the rest of harry's christmas presents were far more satisfactory
	hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge, which harry decidedto soften by the fire before eating ron had given him a book calledflying with the cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favoritequidditch team, and hermione had bought him a luxury eaglefeatherquill
	harry opened the last present to find a new, handknittedsweater from mrs
	weasley and a large plum cake
	he read her cardwith a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about mr
	weasley's car whichhadn't been seen since its crash with the whomping willow, and thebout of rulebreaking he and ron were planning next
	no one, not even someone dreading taking polyjuice potion later,could fail to enjoy christmas dinner at hogwarts
	the great hall looked magnificent
	not only were there a dozenfrostcovered christmas trees and thick streamers of holly andmistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling,warm and dry, from the ceiling
	dumbledore led them in a few of hisfavorite carols, hagrid booming more and more loudly with everygoblet of eggnog he consumed
	percy, who hadn't noticed that fredhad bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read pinhead, keptasking them all what they were sniggering at
	harry didn't even carethat draco malfoy was making loud, snide remarksabout his new sweater from the slytherin table
	with a bit of luck,malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours' time
	harry and ron had barely finished their third helpings of christmaspudding when hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize theirplans for the evening
	we still need a bit of the people you're changing into, saidhermione matteroffacdy, as though she were sending them to thesupermarket for laundry detergent
	and obviously, it'll be best if youcan get something of crabbe's and goyle's they're malfoys bestfriends, he'll tell them anything
	and we also need to make sure thereal crabbe and goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogatinghim
	i've got it all worked out, she went on smoothly, ignoring harry'sand ron's stupefied faces
	she held up two plump chocolate cakes
	i've filled these with a simple sleeping draught
	all you have to do ismake sure crabbe and goyle find them
	you know how greedy theyare, they're bound to eat them
	once they're asleep, pull out a few oftheir hairs and hide them in a broom closet
	harry and ron looked incredulously at each other
	hermione, i don't think that could go seriously wrong but hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the oneprofessor mcgonagall sometimes had
	the potion will be useless without crabbe's and goyle's hair, shesaid sternly
	you do want to investigate malfoy, don't youoh, all right, all right, said harry
	but what about you whose hairare you ripping outi've already got mine said hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottleout of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it
	remember millicent bulstrode wrestling with me at the duelingclub she left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle meand she's gone home for christmas  so i'll just have to tell theslytherins i've decided to come back
	when hermione had bustled off to check on the polyjuice potionagain, ron turned to harry with a doomladen expression
	have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could gowrongbut to harry's and ron's utter amazement, stage one of theoperation went just as smoothly as hermione had said
	they lurkedin the deserted entrance hall after christmas tea, waiting for crabbeand goyle who had remained alone at the slytherin table, shovelingdown fourth helpings of trifle
	harry had perched the chocolatecakes on the end of the banisters
	when they spotted crabbe andgoyle coming out of the great hall, harry and ron hid quicklybehind a suit of armor next to the front door
	how thick can you get ron whispered ecstatically as crabbegleefully pointed out the cakes to goyle and grabbed them
	grinningstupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths
	for amoment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on theirfaces
	then, without the smallest change of expression, they bothkeeled over backward onto the floor
	by far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall
	once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, harryyanked out a couple of the bristles that covered goyle's forehead and ron pulled out several of crabbe's hairs
	they also stoletheir shoes, because their own were far too small for crabbe andgoylesize feet
	then, still stunned at what they had just done, theysprinted up to moaning myrtle's bathroom
	they could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stallin which hermione was stirring the cauldron
	pulling their robes upover their faces, harry and ron knocked softly on the door
	hermionethey heard the scrape of the lock and hermione emerged, shinyfaced and looking anxious
	behind her they heard the gloop gloopof the bubbling, glutinous potion
	three glass tumblers stood ready onthe toilet seat
	did you get them hermione asked breathlessly
	harry showed her goyle's hair
	and i sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry, hermionesaid, holding up a small sack
	you'll need bigger sizes once you'recrabbe and goyle
	the three of them stared into the cauldron
	close up, the potion lookedlike thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly
	i'm sure i've done everything right, said hermione, nervouslyrereading the splotched page of moste potente potions
	it looks like thebook says it should
	once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly an hourbefore we change back into ourselves
	now what ron whispered
	we separate it into three glasses and add the hairs
	hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses
	then, her hand trembling, she shook millicent bulstrode's hair out ofits bottle into the first glass
	the potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly
	asecond later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow
	urgh  essence of millicent bulstrode, said ron, eyeing it withloathing
	bet it tastes disgusting
	add yours, then, said hermione
	harry dropped goyle's hair into the middle glass and ron put crabbe'sinto the last one
	both glasses hissed and frothed goyle's turned thekhaki color of a booger, crabbe's a dark, murky brown
	hang on, said harry as ron and hermione reached for their glasses
	we'd better not all drink them in here
	once we turn into crabbeand goyle we won't fit
	and millicent bulstrode's no pixie
	good thinking, said ron, unlocking the door
	we'll take separatestalls
	careful not to spill a drop of his polyjuice potion, harry slipped intothe middle stall
	ready, came ron's and hermione's voices
	one  two  three pinching his nose, harry drank the potion down in two large gulps
	ittasted like overcooked cabbage
	immediately, his insides started writhing as though he'd just swallowedlive snakes  doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to besick  then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to thevery ends of his fingers and toes  next, bringing him gasping to allfours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his bodybubbled like hot wax  and before his eyes, his hands began to grow,the fingers thickened, the nails broadened,the knuckles were bulging like bolts his shoulders stretched painfullyand a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping downtoward his eyebrows  his robes ripped as his chest expanded like abarrel bursting its hoops  his feet were agony in shoes four sizes toosmallas suddenly as it had started, everything stopped
	harry lay facedownon the stonecold floor, listening to myrtle gurgling morosely in the endtoilet
	with difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up
	so this waswhat it felt like, being goyle
	his large hand trembling, he pulled offhis old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled onthe spare ones, and laced up goyle's boatlike shoes
	he reached up tobrush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wirybristles, low on his forehead
	then he realized that his glasses wereclouding his eyes because goyle obviously didn't need them  he tookthem off and called, are you two okay goyle's low rasp of a voiceissued from his mouth
	yeah, came the deep grunt of crabbe from his right
	harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror
	goyle stared back at him out of dull, deepset eyes
	harry scratchedhis ear
	they stared at each other
	except that he lookedpale and shocked, ron was indistinguishable from crabbe, from thepuddingbowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms
	this is unbelievable, said ron, approaching the mirror and proddingcrabbe's flat nose
	we'd better get going, said harry, loosening the watch that wascutting into goyle's thick wrist
	we've still got to find outwhere the slytherin common room is
	i only hope we can findsomeone to follow
	ron, who had been gazing at harry, said, you don't know howbizarre it is to see goyle thinking
	he banged on hermione's door
	c'mon, we need to go a highpitched voice answered him
	i  i don't think i'm going to come after all
	you go on without me
	hermione, we know millicent bulstrode's ugly, no one's going toknow it's you no  really  i don't think i'll come
	you two hurry up, you rewasting timeharry looked at ron, bewildered
	that looks more like goyle, said ron
	that's how he looks everytime a teacher asks him a question
	hermione, are you okay said harry through the door
	fine  i'm fine  go on harry looked at his watch
	five of their precious sixty minutes hadalready passed
	we'll meet you back here, all right he said
	harry and ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checkedthat the coast was clear, and set off
	don't swing your arms like that, harry muttered to ron
	ehcrabbe holds them sort of stiff
	how's thisyeah, that's better
	they went down the marble staircase
	all they needed now wasa slytherin that they could follow to the slytherin common room, butthere was nobody around
	any ideas muttered harry
	the slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there, saidron, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons
	the words had barelyleft his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from theentrance
	excuse me, said ron, hurrying up to her
	we've forgotten the wayto our common room
	i beg your pardon said the girl stiffly
	our common room i'm aravenclaw
	she walked away, looking suspiciously back at them
	harry and ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, theirfootsteps echoing particularly loudly as crabbe's and goyle's hugefeet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn't going to be as easy as theyhad hoped
	the labyrinthine passages were deserted
	they walked deeper anddeeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to seehow much time they had left
	after a quarter of an hour, just whenthey were getting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead
	ha said ron excitedly
	there's one of them nowthe figure was emerging from a side room
	as they hurried nearer,however, their hearts sank
	it wasn't a slytherin, it was percy
	what're you doing down here said ron in surprise
	percy looked affronted
	that, he said stiffly, is none of your business
	it's crabbe, isn't itwh  oh, yeah, said ron
	well, get off to your dormitories, said percy sternly
	it's not safe togo wandering around dark corridors these days
	you are, ron pointed out
	i, said percy, drawing himself up, am a prefect
	nothing's about toattack me
	a voice suddenly echoed behind harry and ron
	draco malfoy wasstrolling toward them, and for the first time in his life, harry waspleased to see him
	there you are, he drawled, looking at them
	have you two beenpigging out in the great hall all this time i've been looking for you iwant to show you something really funny
	malfoy glanced witheringly at percy
	and what're you doing down here, weasley he sneered
	percy looked outraged
	you want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect he said
	idon't like your attitudemalfoy sneered and motioned for harry and ron to follow him
	harryalmost said something apologetic to percy but caught himself just intime
	he and ron hurried after malfoy, who said as they turned intothe next passage, that peter weasley percy, ron corrected him automatically
	whatever, said malfoy
	i've noticed him sneaking around a lotlately
	and i bet i know what he's up to
	he thinks he's going to catchslytherin's heir singlehanded
	he gave a short, derisive laugh
	harry and ron exchanged excitedlooks
	malfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall
	what's the new password again he said to harry
	oh, yeah pureblood said malfoy, not listening, and a stone doorconcealed in the wall slid open
	malfoy marched through it, andharry and ron followed him
	the slytherin common room was a long, low underground roomwith rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lampswere hanging on chains
	a fire was crackling under an elaboratelycarved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several slytherins weresilhouetted around it in highbacked chairs
	wait here, said malfoy to harry and ron, motioning them to a pairof empty chairs set back from the fire
	i'll go and get it my father'sjust sent it to me wondering what malfoy was going to show them, harry and ronsat down, doing their best to look at home
	malfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked like anewspaper clipping
	he thrust it under ron's nose
	that'll give you a laugh, he said
	harry saw ron's eyes widen in shock
	he read the clipping quickly,gave a very forced laugh, and handed it to harry
	it had been clipped out of the daily prophet, and it saidinquiry at the ministry of magicarthur weasley, head of the misuse of muggle artifacts office,was today fined fifty galleons for bewitching a muggle car
	lucius malfoy, a governor of hogwarts school of witchcraftand wizardry, where theenchanted car crashed earlier this year, called today for mr
	weasley's resignation
	weasley has brought the ministry into disrepute, mr
	malfoy told ourreporter
	he is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculousmuggle protection act should be scrapped immediately
	weasley was unavailable for comment, although his wife toldreporters to clear off or she'd set the family ghoul on them
	well said malfoy impatiently as harry handed the clipping back tohim
	don't you think it's funnyha, ha, said harry bleakly
	arthur weasley loves muggles so much he should snap his wand inhalf and go and join them, said malfoy scornfully
	you'd never knowthe weasleys were purebloods, the way they behave
	ron's  or rather, crabbe's  face was contorted with fury
	what's up with you, crabbe snapped malfoy
	stomachache, ron grunted
	well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those mudbloods a kickfrom me, said malfoy, snickering
	you know, i'm surprised the dailyprophet hasn't reported all these attacks yet, he went on thoughtfully
	i suppose dumbledore's trying to hush it all up
	he'll be sacked if itdoesn't stop soon
	father's always said old dumbledore's the worstthing that's ever happened to this place
	he loves muggleborns
	adecent headmaster would never've let slime like that creevey in
	malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did acruel but accurate impression of colin potter, can i have yourpicture, potter can i have your autograph can i lick your shoes,please, potter'he dropped his hands and looked at harry and ron
	what's the matter with you twofar too late, harry and ron forced themselves to laugh, but malfoyseemed satisfied perhaps crabbe and goyle were always slow onthe uptake
	saint potter, the mudbloods' friend, said malfoy slowly
	he'sanother one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go aroundwith that jumped up granger mudblood
	and people think he'sslytherin's heirharry and ron waited with bated breath malfoy was surely secondsaway from telling them it was him  but theni wish i knew who it is, said malfoy petulantly
	ron's jaw dropped so that crabbe looked even more clueless thanusual
	fortunately, malfoy didn't notice, and harry, thinking fast,said, you must have some idea who's behind it all
	you know i haven't, goyle, how many times do i have to tell yousnapped malfoy
	and father won't tell me anything about the lasttime the chamber was opened either
	of course, it was fifty yearsago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he saysthat it was all kept quiet and it'll look suspicious if i know too muchabout it
	but i know one thing  last time the chamber of secretswas opened, a mudblood died
	so i bet it's a matter of time beforeone of them's killed this time
	i hope it's granger, he said withrelish
	ron was clenching crabbe's gigantic fists
	feeling that it would be abit of a giveaway if ron punched malfoy, harry shot him a warninglook and said, d'you know if the person who opened the chamberlast time was caughtoh, yeah
	whoever it was was expelled, said malfoy
	they'reprobably still in azkaban
	azkaban said harry, puzzled
	azkaban  the wizard prison, goyle, said malfoy, looking at him indisbelief honestly, if you were any slower, you'd be goingbackward
	he shifted restlessly in his chair and said, father says to keep myhead down and let the heir of slytherin get on with it
	he says theschool needs ridding of all the mudblood filth, but not to get mixedup in it
	of course, he's got a lot on his plate at the moment
	youknow the ministry of magic raided our manor last weekharry tried to force goyle's dull face into a look of concern
	luckily, they didn't find much
	father's gotsome very valuable dark arts stuff
	but luckily, we've got our ownsecret chamber under the drawingroom floorho said ron
	even his hair wasturning red
	his nose was also slowly lengthening  their hour wasup, ron was turning back into himself, and from the look of horrorhe was suddenly giving harry, he must be, too
	they both jumped to their feet
	medicine for my stomach, ron grunted, and without further adothey sprinted the length of the slytherin common room, hurledthemselves at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hopingagainst hope that malfoy hadn't noticed anything
	harrycould feel his feet slipping around in goyle's huge shoes and had tohoist up his robes as he shrank they crashed up the steps into the darkentrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from thecloset where they'd locked crabbe and goyle
	leaving their shoesoutside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks up the marblestaircase toward moaning myrtle's bathroom
	well, it wasn't a complete waste of time, ron panted, closing thebathroom door behind them
	i know we still haven't found out who'sdoing the attacks, but i'm going to write to dad tomorrow and tell himto check under the malfoys' drawing room
	harry checked his face in the cracked mirror
	he was back to normal
	he put his glasses on as ron hammered on the door of hermione'sstall
	hermione, come out, we've got loads to tell you go away hermione squeaked
	harry and ron looked at each other
	what's the matter said ron
	you must be back to normal by now,we are
	but moaning myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door
	harry hadnever seen her looking so happy
	ooooooh, wait till you see, she said
	it's awfulthey heard the lock slide back and hermione emerged, sobbing, herrobes pulled up over her head
	what's up said ron uncertainly
	have you still got millicent's noseor somethinghermione let her robes fall and ron backed into the sink
	her face was covered in black fur
	her eyes had turned yellow andthere were long, pointed ears poking through her hair
	it was a ccat hair she howled
	mmillicent bulstrodemmust have a cat and the ppotion isn't supposed to be used foranimal transformationsuhoh, said ron
	you'll be teased something dreadful, said myrtle happily
	it's okay, hermione, said harry quickly
	we'll take you up to thehospital wing
	madam pomfrey never asks too many questions
	it took a long time to persuade hermione to leave the bathroom
	moaning myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw
	waittill everyone finds out you've got a tailc h a p t e r   t h i r t e e nthe very secret diaryhermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks
	there was aflurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the schoolarrived back from their christmas holidays, because of courseeveryone thought that she had been attacked
	so many students filedpast the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that madampomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them aroundhermione's bed, to spare her the shame of being seen with a furryface
	harry and ron went to visit her every evening
	when the new termstarted, they brought her each day's homework
	if i'd sprouted whiskers, i'd take a break from work, said ron, tippinga stack of books onto hermione's bedside table one evening
	don't be silly, ron, i've got to keep up, said hermione briskly
	herspirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair hadgone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown
	i don't suppose you've got any new leads she added in a whisper,so that madam pomfrey couldn't hear her
	nothing, said harry gloomily
	i was so sure it was malfoy, said ron, for about the hundredth time
	what's that asked harry, pointing to something gold sticking outfrom under hermione's pillow
	just a get well card, said hermione hastily, trying to poke it out ofsight, but ron was too quick for her
	he pulled it out, flicked it open,and read aloudto miss granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concernedteacher, professor gilderoy lockhart, order of merlin, third class,honorary member of the dark force defense league, and fivetime winnerof witch weekly's most charmingsmile award
	ron looked up at hermione, disgusted
	you sleep with this under your pillowbut hermione was spared answering by madam pomfrey sweepingover with her evening dose of medicine
	is lockhart the smarmiest bloke you've ever met, or what ronsaid to harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairstoward gryffindor tower
	snape had given them so muchhomework, harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year beforehe finished it
	ron was just saying he wished he had asked hermionehow many rat tails you were supposed to add to a hairraisingpotion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached theirears
	that's filch, harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs andpaused, out of sight, listening hard
	you don't think someone else's been attacked said ron tensely
	they stood still, their heads inclined toward flich's voice, whichsounded quite hysterical
	even more work for me mopping all night, like i haven't got enough todo no, this is the final straw, i'm going to dumbledore his footsteps receded along the outofsight corridor and they heard adistant door slam
	they poked their heads around the corner
	filch had clearly beenmanning his usual lookout post they were once again on the spotwhere mrs
	norris had been attacked
	they saw at a glance whatfilch had been shouting about
	a great flood of water stretched overhalf the corridor, and it looked as though it was still seeping fromunder the door of moaning myrtle's bathroom
	now that filch hadstopped shouting, they could hear myrtle's wails echoing off thebathroom walls
	now what's up with her said ron
	let's go and see, said harry, and holding their robes over theirankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the doorbearing its out of order sign, ignored it as always, and entered
	moaning myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and harder than everbefore
	she seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet
	it was dark inthe bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the greatrush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet
	what's up, myrtle said harry
	who's that glugged myrtle miserably
	come to throw somethingelse at meharry waded across to her stall and said, why would i throwsomething at youdon't ask me, myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave of yet morewater, which splashed onto the already sopping floor
	here i am,minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw abook at me
	but it can't hurt you if someone throws something at you, saidharry, reasonably
	i mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn'tithe had said the wrong thing
	myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked,let's all throw books at myrtle, because she can't feel it ten pointsif you can get it through her stomach fifty points if it goes throughher head well, ha, ha, ha what a lovely game, i don't thinkwho threw it at you, anyway asked harry
	i was just sitting in the ubend, thinking aboutdeath, and it fell right through the top of my head, said myrtle,glaring at them
	it's over there, it got washed out
	harry and ron looked under the sink where myrtle was pointing
	asmall, thin book lay there
	it had a shabby black cover and was aswet as everything else in the bathroom
	harry stepped forward topick it up, but ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back
	are you crazy said ron
	it could be dangerous
	dangeroussaid harry, laughing
	come off it, how could it bedangerousyou'd be surprised, said ron, who was looking apprehensively atthe book
	some of the books the ministry's confiscated dad's toldme  there was one that burned your eyes out
	andeveryone who read sonnets of a sorcerer spoke in limericks for the restof their lives
	and some old witch in bath had a book that you couldnever stop reading you just had to wander around with your nose in it,trying to do everything onehanded
	and all right, i've got the point, said harry
	the little book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy
	well, we won't find out unless we look at it, he said, and he duckedaround ron and picked it up off the floor
	harry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the covertold him it was fifty years old
	he opened it eagerly
	on the first pagehe could just make out the name t m
	riddle in smudged ink
	hang on, said ron, who had approached cautiously and was lookingover harry's shoulder
	riddle got anaward for special services to the school fifty years ago
	how on earth d'you know that said harry in amazement
	because filch made me polish his shield about fifty times indetention, said ron resentfully
	that was the one i burped slugs allover
	if you'd wiped slime off a name for an hour, you'd remember it,too
	harry peeled the wet pages apart
	they were completely blank
	there wasn't the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not evenauntie mabel's birthday, or dentist, halfpast three
	he never wrote in it, said harry, disappointed
	i wonder why someone wanted to flush it away said ron curiously
	harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed nameof a variety store on vauxhall road, london
	he must've been muggleborn, said harry thoughtfufly
	to havebought a diary from vauxhall road
	well, it's not much use to you, said ron
	he dropped his voice
	fiftypoints if you can get it through myrtle's nose
	harry, however, pocketed it
	hermione left the hospital wing, dewhiskered, tailless, and furfree, atthe beginning of february
	on her first evening back in gryffindortower, harry showed her t
	riddle's diary and told her the storyof how they had found it
	oooh, it might have hidden powers, said hermione enthusiastically,taking the diary and looking at it closely
	if it has, it's hiding them very well, said ron
	i don'tknow why you don't chuck it, harry
	i wish i knew why someone did try to chuck it, said harry
	iwouldn't mind knowing how riddle got an award for special servicesto hogwarts either
	could've been anything, said ron
	maybe he got thirty o
	s orsaved a teacher from the giant squid
	maybe he murdered myrtle thatwould've done everyone a favor
	but harry could tell from the arrested look on hermione's face thatshe was thinking what he was thinking
	what said ron, looking from one to the other
	well, the chamber of secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn't ithe said
	that's what malfoy said
	and this diary is fifty years old, said hermione, tapping it excitedly
	sooh, ron, wake up, snapped hermione
	we know the person whoopened the chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago
	riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty yearsago
	well, what if riddle got his special award for catching the heir ofslytherin his diary would probably tell us everything  where thechamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it the person who's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want that lyingaround, would theythat's a brilliant theory, hermione, said ron, with just one tiny littleflaw
	there's nothing written in his diary
	but hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag
	it might be invisible ink she whispered
	she tapped the diary three times and said, apareciumnothing happened
	undaunted, hermione shoved her hand back intoher bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser
	it's a revealer, i got it in diagon alley, she said
	she rubbed hard on january first
	i'm telling you, there's nothing to find in there, said ron
	riddle justgot a diary for christmas and couldn't be bothered filling it in
	harry couldn't explain, even to himself, why he didn't just throwriddle's diary away
	the fact was that even though he knew the diarywas blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages,as though it were a story he wanted to finish
	and while harry wassure he had never heard the name t
	riddle before, it still seemedto mean something to him, almost as thoughriddle was a friend he'd had when he was very small, and hadhalfforgotten
	he'd never had friends beforehogwarts, dudley had made sure of that
	nevertheless, harry was determined to find out more about riddle, sonext day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine riddle'sspecial award, accompanied by an interested hermione and athoroughly unconvinced ron, who told them he'd seen enough of thetrophy room to last him a lifetime
	riddle's burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet
	itdidn't carry details of why it had been given to him good thing, too,or it'd be even bigger and id still be polishing it, said ron
	however,they did find riddle's name on an old medal for magical merit, and ona list of old head boys
	he sounds like percy, said ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust
	probably top of every class you say that like it's a bad thing, said hermione in a slightly hurtvoice
	the sun had now begun to shine weakly on hogwarts again
	insidethe castle, the mood had grown more hopeful
	there had been nomore attacks since those on justin and nearly headless nick, andmadam pomfrey was pleased to report that the mandrakes werebecoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leavingchildhood
	the moment their acne clears up, they'll be ready for repotting again,harry heard her telling filch kindly one afternoon
	and after that, itwon't be long until we're cutting them up and stewing them
	norris back in no time
	perhaps the heir of slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought harry
	it must be getting riskier and riskier to open the chamber of secrets,with the school so alert and suspicious
	perhaps the monster,whatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate foranother fifty years
	ernie macmillan of hufflepuff didn't take this cheerful view
	he wasstill convinced that harry was the guilty one, that he had givenhimself away at the dueling club
	peeves wasn't helping matters hekept popping up in the crowded corridors singing oh, potter, yourotter
	now with a dance routine to match
	gilderoy lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacksstop
	harry overheard him telling professor mcgonagall so while thegryffindors were lining up for transfiguration
	i don't think there'll be any more trouble, minerva, he said, tappinghis nose knowingly and winking
	i think the chamber has been lockedfor good this time
	the culprit must have known it was only a matterof time before i caught him
	rather sensible to stop now, before icame down hard on him
	you know, what the school needs now is a moralebooster
	washaway the memories of last term i won't say any more just now, but ithink i know just the thing
	he tapped his nose again and strode off
	lockhart's idea of a moralebooster became clear at breakfast time onfebruary fourteenth
	harry hadn't had much sleep because of a laterunning quidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down tothe great hall, slightly late
	he thought, for a moment, that he'dwalked through the wrong doors
	the walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers
	worsestill, heartshaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling
	harrywent over to the gryffindor table, where ron was sitting lookingsickened, and hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles
	what's going on harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confettioff his bacon
	ron pointed to the teachers' table, apparently too disgusted to speak
	lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, waswaving for silence
	the teachers on either side of him were lookingstonyfaced
	from where he sat, harry could see a muscle going inprofessor mcgonagall's cheek
	snape looked as though someone hadjust fed him a large beaker of skelegro
	happy valentine's day lockhart shouted
	and may i thank thefortysix people who have so far sent me cards yes, i have taken theliberty of arranging this little surprise for you all  and it doesn't endherelockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hallmarched a dozen surlylooking dwarfs
	not just any dwarfs, however
	lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps
	my friendly, cardcarrying cupids beamed lockhart
	they will beroving around the school today delivering your valentines and the fundoesn't stop here i'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into thespirit of the occasion why not ask professor snape to show you howto whip up a love potion and while you're at it, professor flitwickknows more about entrancing enchantments than any wizard i'veever met, the sly old dogprofessor flitwick buried his face in his hands
	snape was looking as though the first person to ask him for a love potion would beforcefed poison
	please, hermione, tell me you weren't one of the fortysix, 51 said ronas they left the great hall for their first lesson
	hermione suddenlybecame very interested in searching her bag for her schedule anddidn't answer
	all day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to delivervalentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon asthe gryffindors were walking upstairs for charms, one of the dwarfscaught up with harry
	oy, you 'arty potter shouted a particularly grimlooking dwarf,elbowing people out of the way to get to harry
	hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a lineof first years, which happened to include ginny weasley, harry triedto escape
	the dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd bykicking people's shins, and reached him before he'd gone two paces
	i've got a musical message to deliver to 'arry potter in person, hesaid, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way
	not here, harry hissed, trying to escape
	stay still grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of harry's bag and pullinghim back
	let me go harry snarled, tugging
	with a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two
	his books, wand,parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashedover everything
	harry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarfstarted singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor
	what's going on here came the cold, drawling voice of dracomalfoy
	harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his rippedbag, desperate to get away before malfoy could hear his musicalvalentine
	what's all this commotion said another familiar voice as percyweasley arrived
	losing his head, harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarfseized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor
	right, he said, sitting on harry's ankles
	here is your singingvalentinehis eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,his hair is as dark as a blackboard
	i wish he was mine, he's really divine,the hero who conquered the dark lordharry would have given all the gold in gringotts to evaporate on thespot
	trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, hisfeet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as percy weasley did hisbest to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth
	off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class,now, he said, shooing some of the younger students away
	and you,malfoyharry, glancing over, saw malfoy stoop and snatch up something
	leering, he showed it to crabbe and goyle, and harry realized thathe'd got riddle's diary
	give that back, said harry quietly
	wonder what potter's written in this said malfoy, who obviously hadn't noticed the year on the cover and thought he hadharry's own diary
	a hush fell over the onlookers
	ginny was staringfrom the diary to harry, looking terrified
	hand it over, malfoy, said percy sternly
	when i've had a look, said malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly atharry
	percy said, as a school prefect  but harry had lost his temper
	hepulled out his wand and shouted, expelliarmus and just assnape had disarmed lockhart, so malfoy found the diary shootingout of his hand into the air
	ron, grinning broadly, caught it
	harry said percy loudly
	no magic in the corridors
	i'll have toreport this, you knowbut harry didn't care, he was oneup on malfoy, and that was worthfive points from gryffindor any day
	malfoy was looking furious, andas ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully afterher, i don't think potter liked your valentine muchginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class
	snarling,ron pulled out his wand, too, but harry pulled him away
	ron didn'tneed to spend the whole of charms belching slugs
	it wasn't until they had reached professor flitwick's class that harrynoticed something rather odd about riddle's diary
	all his otherbooks were drenched in scarlet ink
	the diary, however, was asclean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it
	hetried to point this out to ron, but ron was having trouble with hiswand again large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end,and he wasn't much interested in anything else
	harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night
	thiswas partly because he didn't think he could stand fred and georgesinging, his eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad one more time,and partly because he wanted to examine riddle's diary again, andknew that ron thought he was wasting his time
	harry sat on his fourposter and flicked through the blank pages, notone of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it
	then he pulled a newbottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped ablot onto the first page of the diary
	the ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though itwas being sucked into the page, vanished
	excited, harry loaded uphis quill a second time and wrote, my name is harry potter
	the words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank withouttrace
	then, at last, something happened
	oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words harryhad never written
	my name is tom riddle
	how did you come by mydiarythese words, too, faded away, but not before harry had started toscribble back
	someone tried to flush it down a toilet
	he waited eagerly for riddle's reply
	lucky that i recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink
	but i always knew that there would be those who would not want thisdiary read
	what do you mean harry scrawled, blotting the page in hisexcitement
	i mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things
	things that werecovered up
	things that happened at hogwarts school of witchcraft andwizardry
	that's where i am now, harry wrote quickly
	i'm at hogwarts, andhorrible stuff's been happening
	do you know anything about thechamber of secretshis heart was hammering
	riddle's reply came quickly, his writingbecoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew
	of course i know about the chamber of secrets
	in my day, they told us itwas a legend, that it did not exist
	in my fifth year, thechamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finallykilling one
	i caught the person whod opened the chamber and he wasexpelled
	but the headmaster, professor dippet, ashamed that such a thinghad happened at hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth
	a story was givenout that thegirl had died in a freak accident
	they gave me a nice, shiny,engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut
	but iknew it could happen again
	the monster lived on, and the one who had thepower to release it was not imprisoned
	harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back
	it's happening again now
	there have been three attacks and no oneseems to know who's behind them
	who was it last timei can show you, if you like, came riddle's reply
	you don't haveto take my word for it
	i can take you inside my memory of the nightwhen i caught him
	harry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary
	what did riddlemean how could he be taken inside somebody else's memory heglanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which wasgrowing dark
	when he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh wordsforming
	harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters
	the pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind,stopping halfway through the month of june
	mouth hanging open,harry saw that the little square for june thirteenth seemed to haveturned into a miniscule television screen
	his hands trembling slightly,he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, andbefore he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward thewindow was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he waspitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of colorand shadow
	he felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurredshapes around him came suddenly into focus
	he knew immediately where he was
	this circular room with thesleeping portraits was dumbledore's office  but it wasn't dumbledorewho was sitting behind the desk
	a wizened, fraillooking wizard, baldexcept for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter bycandlelight
	harry had never seen this man before
	i'm sorry, he said shakily
	i didn't mean to butt in but the wizard didn't look up
	he continued to read, frowning slightly
	harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, er  i'll just go, shallistill the wizard ignored him
	he didn't seem even to have heard him
	thinking that the wizard might be deaf, harry raised his voice
	sorry i disturbed you
	i'll go now, he halfshouted
	the wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked pastharry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at hiswindow
	the sky outside the window was rubyred it seemed to be sunset
	the wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs,watching the door
	harry looked around the office
	no fawkes the phoenix  no whirringsilver contraptions
	this was hogwarts as riddle had known it,meaning that this unknown wizard was headmaster, not dumbledore,and he, harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible tothe people of fifty years ago
	there was a knock on the office door
	enter, said the old wizard in a feeble voice
	a boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat
	a silverprefect's badge was glinting on his chest
	he was much taller thanharry, but he, too, had jetblack hair
	ah, riddle, said the headmaster
	you wanted to see me, professor dippet said riddle
	sit down, said dippet
	i've just been reading the letter you sent me
	he sat down, gripping his hands together verytightly
	my dear boy, said dipper kindly, i cannot possibly let you stay atschool over the summer
	surely you want to go home for theholidaysno, said riddle at once
	id much rather stay at hogwarts than goback to that  to that you live in a muggle orphanage during the holidays, i believe saiddippet curiously
	yes, sir, said riddle, reddening slightly
	you are mugglebornhalfblood, sir, said riddle
	muggle father, witch mother
	and are both your parents my mother died just after i was born, sir
	they told me at theorphanage she lived just long enough to name me  tom after myfather, marvolo after my grandfather
	dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically
	the thing is, tom, he sighed, special arrangements might havebeen made for you, but in the current circumstances
	you mean all these attacks, sir said riddle, and harry's heartleapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything
	precisely, said the headmaster
	my dear boy, you must see howfoolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle whenterm ends
	particularly in light of the recent tragedy
	the death ofthat poor little girl
	you will be safer by far at your orphanage
	asa matter of fact, the ministry of magic is even now talking aboutclosing the school
	we are no nearer locating the er  source of allthis unpleasantness
	riddle's eyes had widened
	sir  if the person was caught  if it all stopped what do you mean said dippet with a squeak in his voice, sittingup in his chair
	riddle, do you mean you know something aboutthese attacksno, sir, said riddle quickly
	but harry was sure it was the same sort of no that he himself hadgiven dumbledore
	dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed
	riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room
	down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to thegargoyle in the darkening corridor
	riddle stopped, and so didharry, watching him
	harry could tell that riddle was doing someserious thinking
	he was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed
	then, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off,harry gliding noiselessly behind him
	they didn't see another personuntil they reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long,sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to riddle from the marblestaircase
	what are you doing, wandering around this late, tomharry gaped at the wizard
	he was none other than a fiftyyearyounger dumbledore
	i had to see the headmaster, sir, said riddle
	well, hurry off to bed, said dumbledore, giving riddle exactly thekind of penetrating stare harry knew so well
	best not to roam thecorridors these days
	he sighed heavily, bade riddle good night, and strode off
	riddlewatched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headedstraight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with harry in hotpursuit
	but to harry's disappointment, riddle led him not into a hiddenpassageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in whichharry had potions with snape
	the torches hadn't been lit, and whenriddle pushed the door almost closed, harry could only justsee him, standing stockstill by the door, watching the passage outside
	it felt to harry that they were there for at least an hour
	all he couldsee was the figure of riddle at the door, staring through the crack,waiting like a statue
	and just when harry had stopped feelingexpectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present,he heard something move beyond the door
	someone was creeping along the passage
	he heard whoever it waspass the dungeon where he and riddle were hidden
	riddle, quiet as ashadow, edged through the door and followed, harry tiptoeing behindhim, forgetting that he couldn't be heard
	for perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until riddlestopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises
	harry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in ahoarse whisper
	gotta get yeh outta here
	there was something familiar about that voice
	riddle suddenly jumped around the corner
	harry stepped out behindhim
	he could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouchingin front of an open door, a very large box next to it
	evening, rubeus, said riddle sharply
	the boy slammed the door shut and stood up
	what yer doin' down here, tomriddle stepped closer
	it's all over, he said
	i'm going to have to turn you in, rubeus
	they're talking about closing hogwarts if the attacks don't stop
	what d'yehi don't think you meant to kill anyone
	but monsters don't makegood pets
	i suppose you just let it out for exercise and it never killed no one said the large boy, backing against theclosed door
	from behind him, harry could hear a funny rustling andclicking
	come on, rubeus, said riddle, moving yet closer
	the dead girl'sparents will be here tomorrow
	the least hogwarts can do is makesure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered
	it wasn't him roared the boy, his voice echoing in the darkpassage
	he wouldn' he neverstand aside, said riddle, drawing out his wand
	his spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light
	the door behindthe large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wallopposite
	and out of it came something that made harry let out along, piercing scream unheard by anyonea vast, lowslung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs a gleam ofmany eyes and a pair of razorsharp pincers  riddle raised hiswand again, but he was too late
	the thing bowled him over as itscuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight
	riddlescrambled to his feet, looking after it he raised his wand, but thehuge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down,yelling, no000000the scene whirled, the darkness became complete harry felt himselffalling and, with a crash, he landed spreadeagled on his fourposterin the gryffindor dormitory, riddle's diary lying open on his stomach
	before he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory dooropened and ron came in
	there you are, he said
	he was sweating and shaking
	what's up said ron, looking at him with concern
	hagrid opened the chamber of secrets fiftyyears ago
	c h a p t e r   f o u r t e e ncornelius fudgeharry, ron, and hermione had always known that hagrid had anunfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures
	during their firstyear at hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little woodenhouse, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, threeheaded dog he'd christened fluffy
	and if, as a boy, hagrid hadheard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, harry wassure he'd have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it
	he'd probablythought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up solong, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legsharry could just imagine the thirteenyearold hagrid trying to fit aleash and collar on it
	but he was equally certain that hagrid wouldnever have meant to kill anybody
	harry half wished he hadn't found out how to work riddle's diary
	again and again ron and hermione made him recount whathe'd seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of thelong, circular conversations that followed
	riddle might have got the wrong person, said hermione
	maybe itwas some other monster that was attacking people
	how many monsters d'you think this place can hold ron askeddully
	we always knew hagrid had been expelled, said harry miserably
	and the attacks must've stopped after hagrid was kicked out
	otherwise, riddle wouldn't have got his award
	ron tried a different tack
	riddle does sound like percy  who asked him to squeal on hagrid,anywaybut the monster had killed someone, ron, said hermione
	and riddle was going to go back to some muggle orphanage if theyclosed hogwarts, said harry
	i don't blame him for wanting to stayhere
	you met hagrid down knockturn alley, didn't you, harryhe was buying a flesheating slug repellent, said harry quickly
	the three of them fell silent
	after a long pause, hermione voiced theknottiest question of all in a hesitant voice
	do you think we should go and ask hagrid about it allthat'd be a cheerful visit, said ron
	tell us, haveyou been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately'in the end, they decided that they would not say anything to hagridunless there was another attack, and as more and more days went bywith no whisper from the disembodied voice, they becamehopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he hadbeen expelled
	it was now nearly four months since justin and nearlyheadless nick had been petrified, and nearly everybody seemed tothink that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good
	peeveshad finally got bored of his oh, potter, you rotter song, erniemacmillan asked harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leapingtoadstools in herbology one day, and in march several of themandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three
	thismade professor sprout very happy
	the moment they start trying to move into each other's pots, we'llknow they're fully mature, she told harry
	then we'll be able torevive those poor people in the hospital wing
	the second years were given something new to think about duringtheir easter holidays
	the time had come to choose their subjects forthe third year, a matter that hermione, at least, took very seriously
	it could affect our whole future, she told harry and ron as theypored over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks
	i just want to give up potions, said harry
	we can't, said ron gloomily
	we keep all our old subjects, or i'd'veditched defense against the dark arts
	but that's very important said hermione, shocked
	not the way lockhart teaches it, said ron
	i haven't learnedanything from him except not to set pixies loose
	neville longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches andwizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what tochoose
	confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists withhis tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought arithmancysounded more difficult than the study of ancient runes
	deanthomas, who, like harry, had grown up with muggles, ended upclosing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking thesubjects it landed on
	hermione took nobody's advice but signed up foreverything
	harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what uncle vernonand aunt petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career inwizardry with them
	not that he didn't get any guidance percyweasley was eager to share his experience
	depends where you want to go, harry, he said
	it's never too earlyto think about the future, so id recommend divination
	people saymuggle studies is a soft option, but i personally think wizards shouldhave a thorough understanding of the nonmagical community,particularly if they're thinking of working in close contact with them look at my father, he has to deal with muggle business all the time
	mybrother charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went forcare of magical creatures
	play to your strengths, harry
	but the only thing harry felt he was really good at was quidditch
	inthe end, he chose the same new subjects as ron, feeling that if he waslousy at them, at least he'd have someone friendly to help him
	gryffindor's next quidditch match would be against hufflepuff
	woodwas insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that harrybarely had time for anything but quidditch and homework
	however,the training sessions were getting better, or at leastdrier, and the evening before saturday's match he went up to hisdormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling gryffindor's chances forthe quidditch cup had never been better
	but his cheerful mood didn't last long
	at the top of the stairs to thedormitory, he met neville longbottom, who was looking frantic
	harry  i don't know who did it  i just found watching harry fearfully, neville pushed open the door
	the contents of harry's trunk had been thrown everywhere
	hiscloak lay ripped on the floor
	the bedclothes had been pulled off hisfourposter and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedsidecabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress
	harry walked over to the bed, openmouthed, treading on a fewloose pages of travels with trolls
	as he and neville pulled theblankets back onto his bed, ron, dean, and seamus came in
	what happened, harryno idea, said harry
	but ron was examining harry's robes
	all thepockets were hanging out
	someone's been looking for something, said ron
	is there anythingmissingharry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk
	it was only as he threw the last of the lockhart books back into itthat he realized what wasn't there
	riddle's diary's gone, he said in an undertone to ron
	whatharry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and ron followedhim out
	they hurried down to the gryffindor commonroom, which was halfempty, and joined hermione, who was sittingalone, reading a book called ancient runes made easy
	hermione looked aghast at the news
	but  only a gryffindor could have stolen  nobody else knows ourpassword exactly, said harry
	they woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshingbreeze
	perfect quidditch conditions said wood enthusiastically at thegryffindor table, loading the team's plates with scrambled eggs
	harry, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast
	harry had been staring down the packed gryffindor table, wonderingif the new owner of riddle's diary was right in front of his eyes
	hermione had been urging him to report the robbery, but harry didn'tlike the idea
	he'd have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and howmany people knew why hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago hedidn't want to be the one who brought it all up again
	as he left the great hall with ron and hermione to go and collect hisquidditch things, another very serious worry was added to harry'sgrowing list
	he had just set foot on the marble staircase when heheard it yet againkill this time
	he shouted aloud and ron and hermione both jumped away from himin alarm
	the voice said harry, looking over his shoulder
	i just heard itagain  didn't youron shook his head, wideeyed
	hermione, however, clapped ahand to her forehead
	harry  i think i've just understood something i've got to go to thelibraryand she sprinted away, up the stairs
	what does she understand said harry distractedly, still lookingaround, trying to tell where the voice had come from
	loads more than i do, said ron, shaking his head
	but why's she got to go to the librarybecause that's what hermione does, said ron, shrugging
	when indoubt, go to the library
	harry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but peoplewere now emerging from the great hall behind him, talking loudly,exiting through the front doors on their way to the quidditch pitch
	you'd better get moving, said ron
	it's nearly eleven  the match harry raced up to gryffindor tower, collected his nimbus twothousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds,but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, andas he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker
	room, his only comfortwas that everyone was now outside to watch the game
	the teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause
	oliverwood took off for a warmup flight around the goal posts madamhooch released the balls
	the hufflepuffs, who played in canaryyellow, were standing in a huddle, having a lastminute discussion oftactics
	harry was just mounting his broom when professor mcgonagallcame half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying anenormous purple megaphone
	harry's heart dropped like a stone
	this match has been cancelled, professor mcgonagall calledthrough the megaphone, addressing the packed stadium
	there wereboos and shouts
	oliver wood, looking devastated, landed and rantoward professor mcgonagall without getting off his broomstick
	but, professor he shouted
	we've got to play  the cupgryffindor professor mcgonagall ignored him and continued to shout through hermegaphoneall students are to make their way back to the house commonrooms, where their heads of houses will give them furtherinformation
	as quickly as you can, pleasethen she lowered the megaphone and beckoned harry over to her
	potter, i think you'd better come with me
	wondering how she could possibly suspect him this time, harry sawron detach himself from the complaining crowd he came running upto them as they set off toward the castle
	to harry's surprise,professor mcgonagall didn't object
	yes, perhaps you'd better come, too, weasley
	some of the students swarming around them were grumbling aboutthe match being canceled others looked worried
	harry and ronfollowed professor mcgonagall back into the school and up themarble staircase
	but they weren't taken to anybody's office this time
	this will be a bit of a shock, said professor mcgonagall in asurprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary
	there hasbeen another attack
	another double attack
	harry's insides did a horrible somersault
	professor mcgonagallpushed the door open and he and ron entered
	madam pomfrey was bending over a fifthyear girl with long, curlyhair
	harry recognized her as the ravenclaw they'd accidentallyasked for directions to the slytherin common room
	and on the bednext to her washermione ron groaned
	hermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy
	they were found near the library, said professor mcgonagall
	idon't suppose either of you can explain this it was on the floor nextto them
	she was holding up a small, circular mirror
	harry and ron shook their heads, both staring at hermione
	i will escort you back to gryffindor tower, said professormcgonagall heavily
	i need to address the students in any case
	all students will return to their house common rooms by six o'clockin the evening
	no student is to leave the dormitories after that time
	you will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher
	no student is to usethe bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher
	all further quidditchtraining and matches are to be postponed
	there will be no moreevening activities
	the gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to professormcgonagall in silence
	she rolled up the parchmentfrom which she had been reading and said in a somewhat chokedvoice, i need hardly add that i have rarely been so distressed
	it islikely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind theseattacks is caught
	i would urge anyone who thinks they might knowanything about them to come forward
	she climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and thegryffindors began talking immediately
	that's two gryffindors down, not counting a gryffindor ghost, oneravenclaw, and one hufflepuff,  said the weasley twins' friend leejordan, counting on his fingers
	haven't any of the teachers noticedthat the slytherins are all safe isn't it obvious all this stuff's comingfrom slytherin the heir of slytherin, the monster of slytherin  whydon't they just chuck all the slytherins out he roared, to nods andscattered applause
	percy weasley was sitting in a chair behind lee, but for once he didn'tseem keen to make his views heard
	he was looking pale and stunned
	percy's in shock, george told harry quietly
	that ravenclaw girl penelope clearwater  she's a prefect
	i don't think he thought themonster would dare attack a prefect
	but harry was only halflistening
	he didn't seem to be able to get ridof the picture of hermione, lying on the hospital bed as though carvedout of stone
	and if the culprit wasn't caught soon, he was looking at alifetime back with the dursleys
	tom riddle had turned hagrid inbecause he was faced with the prospect of a muggle orphanage if theschool closed
	harry now knew exactly how he had felt
	what're we going to do said ron quietly in harry's ear
	d'youthink they suspect hagridwe've got to go and talk to him, said harry, making up hismind
	i can't believe it's him this time, but if he set the monsterloose last time he'll know how to get inside the chamber of secrets,and that's a start
	but mcgonagall said we've got to stay in our tower unless we'rein class i think, said harry, more quietly still, it's time to get my dad'sold cloak out again
	harry had inherited just one thing from his father a long and silvery invisibility cloak
	it was their only chance of sneaking out ofthe school to visit hagrid without anyone knowing about it
	theywent to bed at the usual time, waited until neville, dean, and seamus had stopped discussing the chamber of secrets and finallyfallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak overthemselves
	the journey through the dark and deserted castle corridorswasn't enjoyable
	harry, who had wandered the castle at night several times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset
	teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs,staring around for any unusual activity
	their invisibility cloakdidn't stop them making any noise, and there was a particularlytense moment when ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spotwhere snape stood standing guard
	thankfully, snape sneezed atalmost exactly the moment ron swore
	it was with relief that theyreached the oak front doors and eased them open
	it was a clear, starry night
	they hurried toward the lit windowsof hagrid's house and pulled off the cloak only when they wereright outside his front door
	seconds after they had knocked, hagrid flung it open
	they foundthemselves facetoface with him aiming a crossbow at them
	fangthe boarhound barked loudly behind him
	oh, he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them
	what'reyou two doin' herewhat's that for said harry, pointing at the crossbow as theystepped inside
	nothin'  nothin'   hagrid muttered
	i've bin expectin' doesn'matter  sit down  i'll make tea he hardly seemed to know what he was doing
	he nearlyextinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and thensmashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand
	are you okay, hagrid said harry
	did you hear abouthermioneoh, i heard, all righ', said hagrid, a slight break in his voice
	he kept glancing nervously at the windows
	he poured them bothlarge mugs of boiling water he had forgotten to add tea bags andwas just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loudknock on the door
	hagrid dropped the fruitcake
	harry and ron exchangedpanicstricken looks, then threw the invisibility cloak back overthemselves and retreated into a corner
	hagrid checked that theywere hidden, seized his crossbow, and flung open his door oncemore
	he entered, looking deadly serious, and wasfollowed by a second, very oddlooking man
	the stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, andwas wearing a strange mixture of clothes a pinstriped suit, ascarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots
	under his armhe carried a limegreen bowler
	that's dad's boss ron breathed
	cornelius fudge, the minister ofmagicharry elbowed ron hard to make him shut up
	hagrid had gone pale and sweaty
	he dropped into one of his chairsand looked from dumbledore to cornelius fudge
	bad business, hagrid, said fudge in rather clipped tones
	four attacks on muggleborns
	things've gonefar enough
	ministry's got to act
	i never, said hagrid, looking imploringly at dumbledore
	you know inever, professor dumbledore, sir i want it understood, cornelius, that hagrid has my full confidence,said dumbledore, frowning at fudge
	look, albus, said fudge, uncomfortably
	hagrid's record's againsthim
	ministry's got to do something  the school governors have beenin touch yet again, cornelius, i tell you that taking hagrid away will not helpin the slightest, said dumbledore
	his blue eyes were full of a fireharry had never seen before
	look at it from my point of view, said fudge, fidgeting with hisbowler
	i'm under a lot of pressure
	got to be seen to be doingsomething
	if it turns out it wasn't hagrid, he'll be back and no moresaid
	but i've got to take him
	wouldn't be doing my duty take me said hagrid, who was trembling
	take me wherefor a short stretch only, said fudge, not meeting hagrid's eyes
	nota punishment, hagrid, more a precaution
	if someone else is caught,you'll be let out with a full apology not azkaban croaked hagrid
	before fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door
	dumbledore answered it
	it was harry's turn for an elbow in the ribshe'd let out an audible gasp
	lucius malfoy strode into hagrid's hut, swathed in a long blacktraveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile
	fang started togrowl
	already here, fudge, he said approvingly
	what're you doin' here said hagrid furiously
	get outta my housemy dear man, please believe me, i have no pleasure at all in beinginside your  er  d'you call this a house said lucius malfoy, sneeringas he looked around the small cabin
	i simply called at the school andwas told that the headmaster was here
	and what exactly did you want with me, lucius said dumbledore
	he spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes
	dreadful thing, dumbledore, said malfoy lazily, taking out a long rollof parchment, but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside
	this is an order of suspension  you'll find all twelve signatures on it
	i'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch
	how many attacks havethere been now two more this afternoon, wasn't it at this rate,there'll be no muggleborns left at hogwarts, and we all know whatan awful loss that would be to the school
	oh, now, see here, lucius, said fudge, looking alarmed,dumbledore suspended  no, no  last thing we want just nowthe appointment  or suspension  of the headmaster is a matter forthe governors, fudge, said mr
	and asdumbledore has failed to stop these attacks see here, malfoy, if dumbledore can't stop them, said fudge, whoseupper lip was sweating now, i mean to say, who canthat remains to be seen, said mr
	malfoy with a nasty smile
	but asall twelve of us have voted hagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling
	'an' how many did yeh have ter threaten an' blackmail before theyagreed, malfoy, eh he roared
	dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into troubleone of these days, hagrid, said mr
	i would advise you notto shout at the azkaban guards like that
	they won't like it at all
	yeh can' take dumbledore yelled hagrid, making fang theboarhound cower and whimper in his basket
	take him away, an' themuggleborns won' stand a chance there'll be killin' nextcalm yourself, hagrid, said dumbledore sharply
	he looked atlucius malfoy
	if the governors want my removal, lucius, i shall of course step asidebut  stuttered fudge
	dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off lucius malfoy'scold gray ones
	however, said dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so thatnone of them could miss a word, you will find that i willonly truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me
	youwill also find that help will always be given at hogwarts to thosewho ask for it
	for a second, harry was almost sure dumbledore's eyes flickeredtoward the corner where he and ron stood hidden
	admirable sentiments, said malfoy, bowing
	we shall all missyourerhighly individual way of running things albus, andonly hope that your successor will manage to prevent anyahkillins
	he strode to the cabin door, opened it and bowed dumbledoreout
	fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waited for hagrid to go aheadof him, but hagrid stood his ground, took a deep breath, and saidcarefully, if anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they'd haveter do would be ter follow the spiders
	that'd lead 'em right  that'sall i'm sayin
	fudge stared at him in amazement
	all right, i'm comin', said hagrid, pulling on his moleskinovercoat
	but as he was about to follow fudge through the door, hestopped again and said loudly, an' someone'll need ter feed fangwhile i'm away
	the door banged shut and ron pulled off the invisibility cloak
	we're in trouble now, he said hoarsely
	they might as well close the school tonight
	there'll be an attack a day with him gone
	fang started howling, scratching at the closed door
	c h a p t e r    f i f t e e naragogsummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle sky and lakealike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst intobloom in the greenhouses
	but with no hagrid visible from the castlewindows, striding the grounds with fang at his heels, the scene didn'tlook right to harry no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle,where things were so horribly wrong
	harry and ron had tried to visit hermione, but visitors were nowbarred from the hospital wing
	we're taking no more chances, madam pomfrey told them severelythrough a crack in the infirmary door
	no, i'm sorry, there's everychance the attacker might come back to finish these people off
	with dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that thesun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullionedwindows
	there was barely a face to be seen in the schoolthat didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang throughthe corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled
	harry constantly repeated dumbledore's final words to himself i willonly truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me
	help willalways be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it
	but what goodwere these words who exactly were they supposed to ask for help,when everyone was just as confused and scared as they werehagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand thetrouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle tofollow
	harry looked everywhere he went, helped rather reluctantlyby ron
	they were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren'tallowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castlein a pack with the other gryffindors
	most of their fellow studentsseemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class byteachers, but harry found it very irksome
	one person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying theatmosphere of terror and suspicion
	draco malfoy was struttingaround the school as though he had just been appointed head boy
	harry didn't realize what he was so pleased about until the potionslesson about two weeks after dumbledore and hagrid had left, when,sitting right behind malfoy, harry overheard him gloating to crabbeand goyle
	i always thought father might be the one who got rid ofdumbledore, he said, not troubling to keep his voice down
	i told youhe thinks dumbledore's the worst headmaster the school's everhad
	maybe we'll get a decent headmaster now
	someone who won'twant the chamber of secrets closed
	mcgonagall won't last long,she's only filling in
	snape swept past harry, making no comment about hermione'sempty seat and cauldron
	sir, said malfoy loudly
	sir, why don't you apply for theheadmaster's jobnow, now, malfoy, said snape, though he couldn't suppress a thinlipped smile
	professor dumbledore has only been suspended by thegovernors
	i daresay he'll be back with us soon enough
	yeah, right, said malfoy, smirking
	i expect you'd have father'svote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job  i'll tell father you're thebest teacher here, sir snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately notspotting seamus finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into hiscauldron
	i'm quite surprised the mudbloods haven't all packed their bags bynow, malfoy went on
	bet you five galleons the next one dies
	pityit wasn't granger the bell rang at that moment, which was lucky at malfoy's lastwords, ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bagsand books, his attempts to reach malfoy went unnoticed
	let me at him, ron growled as harry and dean hung onto his arms
	i don't care, i don't need my wand, i'm going to kill him with my barehands hurry up, i've got to take you all to herbology, barked snape overthe class's heads, and off they marched, with harry, ron, and deanbringing up the rear, ron still trying to get loose
	it was onlysafe to let go of him when snape had seen them out of the castle andthey were making their way across the vegetable patch toward thegreenhouses
	the herbology class was very subdued there were now two missingfrom their number, justin and hermione
	professor sprout set them all to work pruning the abyssinianshrivelfigs
	harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto thecompost heap and found himself facetoface with ernie macmillan
	ernie took a deep breath and said, very formally, i just want to say,harry, that i'm sorry i ever suspected you
	i know you'd never attackhermione granger, and i apologize for all the stuff i said
	we're all inthe same boat now, and, well he held out a pudgy hand, and harry shook it
	ernie and his friend hannah came to work at the same shrivelfig asharry and ron
	that draco malfoy character, said ernie, breaking off dead twigs,he seems very pleased about all this, doesn't he d'you know, i thinkhe might be slytherin's heir
	that's clever of you, said ron, who didn't seem to have forgivenernie as readily as harry
	do you think it's malfoy, harry ernie asked
	no, said harry, so firmly that ernie and hannah stared
	a second later, harry spotted something
	several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other sideof the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking theshortest route to a prearranged meeting
	harry hit ron over the handwith his pruning shears
	ouch what're you harry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyesscrewed up against the sun
	oh, yeah, said ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased
	but we can'tfollow them now ernie and hannah were listening curiously
	harry's eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders
	if they pursuedtheir fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they wouldend up
	looks like they're heading for the forbidden forest
	and ron looked even unhappier about that
	at the end of the lesson professor sprout escorted the class to theirdefense against the dark arts lesson
	harry and ron lagged behindthe others so they could talk out of earshot
	we'll have to use the invisibility cloak again, harry told ron
	wecan take fang with us
	he's used to going into the forest with hagrid,he might be some help
	right, said ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers
	er  aren't there  aren't there supposed to be werewolves in theforest he added as they took their usual places at the back oflockhart's classroom
	preferring not to answer that question, harry said, there are goodthings in there, too
	the centaurs are all right, and the unicorns
	ron had never been into the forbidden forest before
	harry hadentered it only once and had hoped never to do so again
	lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him
	everyother teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, butlockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant
	come now, he cried, beaming around him
	why all these longfacespeople swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered
	don't you people realize, said lockhart, speaking slowly, as thoughthey were all a bit dim, the danger has passed the culprit has beentaken away says who said dean thomas loudly
	my dear young man, the minister of magic wouldn't have takenhagrid if he hadn't been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,said lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that one and onemade two
	oh, yes he would, said ron, even more loudly than dean
	i flatter myself i know a touch more about hagrid's arrest than youdo, mr
	weasley, said lockhart in a selfsatisfied tone
	ron started to say that he didn't think so, somehow, but stopped inmidsentence when harry kicked him hard under the desk
	we weren't there, remember harry muttered
	but lockhart's disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had alwaysthought hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole businesswas now at an end, irritated harry so much that he yearned to throwgadding with ghouls right in lockhart's stupid face
	instead hecontented himself with scrawling a note to ron let's do it tonight
	ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at theempty seat usually filled by hermione
	the sight seemed to stiffen hisresolve, and he nodded
	the gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days,because from six o'clock onward the gryffindors had no where else to go
	they also had plenty to talk about, with the resultthat the common room often didn't empty until past midnight
	harry went to get the invisibility cloak out of his trunk right afterdinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room toclear
	fred and george challenged harry and ron to a few games ofexploding snap, and ginny sat watching them, very subdued inhermione's usual chair
	harry and ron kept losing on purpose, tryingto finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnightwhen fred, george, and ginny finally went to bed
	harry and ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doorsclosing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, andclimbing through the portrait hole
	it was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all theteachers
	at last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock onthe oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop anycreaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds
	'course, said ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass,we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow
	thosespiders might not've been going there at all
	i know it looked like theywere moving in that sort of general direction, but
	his voice trailed away hopefully
	they reached hagrid's house, sad and sorrylooking with its blankwindows
	when harry pushed the door open, fang went mad with joyat the sight of them
	worried he might wake everyone at the castlewith his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle fudge froma tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together
	harry left the invisibility cloak on hagrid's table
	there would be noneed for it in the pitchdark forest
	c'mon, fang, we're going for a walk, said harry, patting his leg, andfang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to theedge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree
	harry took out his wand, murmured, lumos and a tiny lightappeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path forsigns of spiders
	good thinking, said ron
	id light mine, too, but you know  it'dprobably blow up or something
	harry tapped ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass
	two solitaryspiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of thetrees
	okay, ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, i'm ready
	so, with fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves,they entered the forest
	by the glow of harry's wand, they followedthe steady trickle of spiders moving along the path
	they walkedbehind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard fornoises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves
	then, when thetrees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead wereno longer visible, and harry's wand shone alone in the sea of dark,they saw their spider guides leaving the path
	harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, buteverything outside his little sphere of light was pitchblack
	he hadnever been this deep into the forest before
	he could vividlyremember hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last timehe'd been in here
	but hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting ina cell in azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders
	something wet touched harry's hand and he jumped backward,crushing rods foot, but it was only fang's nose
	what d'you reckon harry said to ron, whose eyes he could justmake out, reflecting the light from his wand
	we've come this far, said ron
	so they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees
	they couldn't move very quickly now there were tree roots andstumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness
	harry couldfeel fang's hot breath on his hand
	more than once, they had to stop,so that harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight
	they walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robessnagging on lowslung branches and brambles
	after a while, theynoticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though thetrees were as thick as ever
	then fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both harryand ron jump out of their skins
	what said ron loudly, looking around into the pitchdark, andgripping harry's elbow very hard
	there's something moving over there, harry breathed
	sounds like something big
	some distance to their right, the something big wassnapping branches as it carved a path through the trees
	oh, no, oh, no, oh shut up, said harry frantically
	hear me said ron in an unnaturally high voice
	it's already heardfangthe darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as theystood, terrified, waiting
	there was a strange rumbling noise and thensilence
	what d'you think it's doing said harry
	probably getting ready to pounce, said ron
	they waited, shivering, hardly daring to move
	d'you think it's gone harry whispered
	dunno then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in thedarkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes
	fang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns andyelped even louder
	harry ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief harry, it's ourcarwhatcome onharry blundered after ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping,and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing
	weasley's car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle ofthick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze
	asron walked, openmouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him,exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner
	it's been here all the time said ron delightedly, walking around thecar
	the forest's turned it wild
	the sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud
	apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own
	fang didn't seem at all keen on it he kept close to harry, who couldfeel him quivering
	his breathing slowing down again, harry stuffedhis wand back into his robes
	and we thought it was going to attack us said ron, leaning againstthe car and patting it
	i wondered where it had goneharry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders,but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights
	we've lost the trail, he said
	c'mon, let's go and find them
	his eyes were fixed on a pointsome ten feet above the forest floor, right behind harry
	his face waslivid with terror
	harry didn't even have time to turn around
	there was a loud clickingnoise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him aroundthe middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hangingfacedown
	struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw ron'slegs leave the ground, too, heard fang whimpering and howling  nextmoment, he was being swept away into the dark trees
	head hanging, harry saw that what had hold of him was marching onsix immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly belowa pair of shining black pincers
	behind him, he could hear another ofthe creatures, no doubt carrying ron
	they were moving into the veryheart of the forest
	harry could hear fang fighting to free himself froma third monster, whining loudly, but harry couldn't have yelled even ifhe had wanted to he seemed to have left his voice back with the carin the clearing
	he never knew how long he was in the creature's clutches he onlyknew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that theleafstrewn ground was now swarming with spiders
	craning his necksideways, he realized that they had reached the ridge ofa vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the starsshone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on
	not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below
	spiders the size of carthorses, eighteyed, eightlegged, black, hairy,gigantic
	the massive specimen that was carrying harry made its waydown the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center ofthe hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking theirpincers excitedly at the sight of its load
	harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him
	ronand fang thudded down next to him
	fang wasn't howling anymore,but cowering silently on the spot
	ron looked exactly like harry felt
	his mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyeswere popping
	harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him wassaying something
	it had been hard to tell, because he clicked hispincers with every word he spoke
	aragogand from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of asmall elephant emerged, very slowly
	there was gray in the black ofhis body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head wasmilky white
	what is it he said, clicking his pincers rapidly
	men, clicked the spider who had caught harry
	is it hagrid said aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyeswandering vaguely
	strangers, clicked the spider who had brought ron
	kill them, clicked aragog fretfully
	we're friends of hagrid's, harry shouted
	his heart seemed to haveleft his chest to pound in his throat
	click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow
	hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before, he said slowly
	hagrid's in trouble, said harry, breathing very fast
	that's whywe've come
	in trouble said the aged spider, and harry thought he heard concernbeneath the clicking pincers
	but why has he sent youharry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it he didn'tthink his legs would support him
	so he spoke from the ground, ascalmly as he could
	they think,, up at the school, that hagrid's been setting a a something on students
	they've taken him to azkaban
	aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow thesound was echoed by the crowd of spiders it was like applause,except applause didn't usually make harry feel sick with fear
	but that was years ago, said aragog fretfully
	that's why they made him leave the school
	theybelieved that i was the monster that dwells in what they call thechamber of secrets
	they thought that hagrid had opened thechamber and set me free
	you didn't come from the chamber of secrets saidharry, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead
	i said aragog, clicking angrily
	i was not born in the castle
	i comefrom a distant land
	a traveler gave me to hagrid when i was an egg
	hagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard inthe castle, feeding me on scraps from the table
	hagridis my good friend, and a good man
	when i was discovered, andblamed for the death of a girl, he protected me
	i have lived here inthe forest ever since, where hagrid still visits me
	he even found mea wife, mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all throughhagrid's goodness
	harry summoned what remained of his courage
	so you never  never attacked anyonenever, croaked the old spider
	it would have been my instinct, butout of respect for hagrid, i never harmed a human
	the body of thegirl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom
	i never saw anypart of the castle but the cupboard in which i grew up
	our kind likethe dark and the quiet
	do you know what did kill that girl said harry
	because whatever it is, it's back and attacking people again his words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and therustling of many long legs shifting angrily large black shapes shiftedall around him
	the thing that lives in the castle, said aragog, is an ancient creaturewe spiders fear above all others
	well do i remember how i pleadedwith hagrid to let me go, when i sensed the beast moving about theschool
	what is it said harry urgently
	more loud clicking, more rustling the spiders seemed to be closing in
	we do not speak of it said aragog fiercely
	we do not name it inever even told hagrid the name of that dread creature, though heasked me, many times
	harry didn't want to press the subject, not with the spiderspressing closer on all sides
	aragog seemed to be tired of tamng
	hewas backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiderscontinued to inch slowly toward harry and ron
	we'll just go, then, harry called desperately to aragog, hearingleaves rustling behind him
	go said aragog slowly
	but  but my sons and daughters do not harm hagrid, on my command
	but icannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into ourmidst
	goodbye, friend of hagrid
	feet away, towering above him, was a solid wallof spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads
	even as he reached for his wand, harry knew it was no good, therewere too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die fighting,a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through thehollow
	weasley's car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring,its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside several were thrown ontotheir backs, their endless legs waving in the air
	the car screeched toa halt in front of harry and ron and the doors flew open
	get fang harry yelled, diving into the front seat ron seized theboarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back ofthe car  the doors slammed shut  ron didn't touch the acceleratorbut the car didn't need him the engine roared and they were off,hitting more spiders
	they sped up the slope, out of the hollow, andthey were soon crashing through the forest, brancheswhipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through thewidest gaps, following a path it obviously knew
	harry looked sideways at ron
	his mouth was still open in the silentscream, but his eyes weren't popping anymore
	are you okayron stared straight ahead, unable to speak
	they smashed their way through the undergrowth, fang howling loudlyin the back seat, and harry saw the side mirror snap off as theysqueezed past a large oak
	after ten noisy, rocky minutes, the treesthinned, and harry could again see patches of sky
	the car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into thewindshield
	they had reached the edge of the forest
	fang flunghimself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when harryopened the door, he shot off through the trees to hagrid's house, tailbetween his legs
	harry got out too, and after a minute or so, ronseemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiffneckedand staring
	harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back intothe forest and disappeared from view
	harry went back into hagrid's cabin to get the invisibility cloak
	fangwas trembling under a blanket in his basket
	when harry got outsideagain, he found ron being violently sick in the pumpkin patch
	follow the spiders, said ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve
	i'll never forgive hagrid
	we're lucky to be alive
	i bet he thought aragog wouldn't hurt friends of his, said harry
	that's exactly hagrid's problem said ron, thumping the wall of thecabin
	he always thinks monsters aren't as bad as they'remade out, and look where it's got him a cell in azkaban he wasshivering uncontrollably now
	what was the point of sending us inthere what have we found out, id like to knowthat hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets, said harry,throwing the cloak over ron and prodding him in the arm to make himwalk
	ron gave a loud snort
	evidently, hatching aragog in a cupboardwasn't his idea of being innocent
	as the castle loomed nearer harry twitched the cloak to make suretheir feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar
	they walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up themarble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors wherewatchful sentries were walking
	at last they reached the safety of thegryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself intoglowing ash
	they took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair totheir dormitory
	ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed
	harry,however, didn't feel very sleepy
	he sat on the edge of his fourposter,thinking hard about everything aragog had said
	the creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought,sounded like a sort of monster voldemort  even other monsters didn'twant to name it
	but he and ron were no closer to finding out what itwas, or how it petrified its victims
	even hagrid had never knownwhat was in the chamber of secrets
	harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against hispillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window
	he couldn't see what else they could do
	they had hit dead endseverywhere
	riddle had caught the wrong person, the heir ofslytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the sameperson, or a different one, who had opened the chamber this time
	there was nobody else to ask
	harry lay down, still thinking aboutwhat aragog had said
	he was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very lasthope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright
	ron, he hissed through the dark, ron ron woke with a yelp like fang's, stared wildly around, and sawharry
	ron that girl who died
	aragog said she was found in a bathroom,said harry, ignoring neville's snufing snores from the corner
	whatif she never left the bathroom what if she's still thereron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight
	and then heunderstood, too
	you don't think  not moaning myrtlec h a p t e r   s i x t e e nthe chamber of secretsall those times we were in that bathroom, and she was justthree toilets away, said ron bitterly at breakfast next day,and we could've asked her, and now
	it had been hard enough trying to look for spiders
	escaping theirteachers long enough to sneak into a girls' bathroom, the girls' bathroom,moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to bealmost impossible
	but something happened in their first lesson, transfiguration, that drovethe chamber of secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks
	ten minutes into the class, professor mcgonagall told them that theirexams would start on the first of june, one week from today
	exams howled seamus finnigan
	we're still getting examsthere was a loud bang behind harry as neville longbottom's wandslipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk
	professorrmcgonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned,frowning, to seamus
	the whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you toreceive your education, she said sternly
	the exams will thereforetake place as usual, and i trust you are all studying hard
	studying hard it had never occurred to harry that there would beexams with the castle in this state
	there was a great deal of mutinousmuttering around the room, which made professor mcgonagall scowleven more darkly
	professor dumbledore's instructions were to keep the school runningas normally as possible, she said
	and that, i need hardly point out,means finding out how much you have learned this year
	harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to beturning into slippers
	what had he learned so far this year he couldn'tseem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam
	ron looked as though he'd just been told he had to go and live in theforbidden forest
	can you imagine me taking exams with this he asked harry, holdingup his wand, which had just started whistling loudly
	three days before their first exam, professor mcgonagall madeanother announcement at breakfast
	i have good news, she said, and the great hall, instead of fallingsilent, erupted
	dumbledore's coming back several people yelled joyfully
	you've caught the heir of slytherin squealed a girl at theravenclaw table
	quidditch matches are back on roared wood excitedly
	when the hubbub had subsided, professor mcgonagall said,professor sprout has informed me that the mandrakes are ready forcutting at last
	tonight, we will be able to revive those people whohave been petrified
	i need hardly remind you all that one of them maywell be able to tell us who, or what, attacked them
	i am hopeful thatthis dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit
	there was an explosion of cheering
	harry looked over at theslytherin table and wasn't at all surprised to see that draco malfoyhadn't joined in
	ron, however, was looking happier than he'd looked indays
	it won't matter that we never asked myrtle, then he said to harry
	hermione'll probably have all the answers when they wake her upmind you, she'll go crazy when she finds out we've got exams in threedays' time
	it might be kinder to leave her whereshe is till they're over
	just then, ginny weasley came over and sat down next to ron
	shelooked tense and nervous, and harry noticed that her hands weretwisting in her lap
	what's up said ron, helping himself to more porridge
	ginny didn't say anything, but glanced up and down the gryffindortable with a scared look on her face that reminded harry of someone,though he couldn't think who
	spit it out, said ron, watching her
	harry suddenly realized who ginny looked like
	she was rockingbackward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like dobby didwhen he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information
	i've got to tell you something, ginny mumbled, carefully not looking atharry
	what is it said harry
	ginny looked as though she couldn't find the right words
	ginny opened her mouth, but no sound came out
	harry leanedforward and spoke quietly, so that only ginny and ron could hear him
	is it something about the chamber of secrets have you seensomething someone acting oddlyginny drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, percy weasleyappeared, looking tired and wan
	if you've finished eating, i'll take that seat, ginny
	i'm starving, i'veonly just come off patrol duty
	ginny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified, gavepercy a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away
	percy satdown and grabbed a mug from the center of the table
	percy said ron angrily
	she was just about to tell us some' thingimportanthalfway through a gulp of tea, percy choked
	what sort of thing he said, coughing
	i just asked her if she'd seen anything odd, and she started to sayoh  that  that's nothing to do with the chamber of secrets, saidpercy at once
	how do you know said ron, his eyebrows raised
	well, er, if you must know, ginny, er, walked in on me the other daywhen i was  well, never mind  the point is, she spotted me doing something and i, um, i asked her not to mention it toanybody
	i must say, i did think she'd keep her word
	it's nothing,really, id just rather harry had never seen percy look so uncomfortable
	what were you doing, percy said ron, grinning
	go on, tell us, wewon't laugh
	percy didn't smile back
	pass me those rolls, harry, i'm starving
	harry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow withouttheir help, but he wasn't about to pass up a chance to speak to myrtleif it turned up  and to his delight it did, midmorning, when they werebeing led to history of magic by gilderoy lockhart
	lockhart, who had so often assured them that all danger had passed,only to be proved wrong right away, was now wholeheartedlyconvinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safelydown the corridors
	his hair wasn't as sleek as usual it seemed hehad been up most of the night, patrolling the fourth floor
	mark my words, he said, ushering them around a corner
	the firstwords out of those poor petrified people's mouths will be it washagrid
	' frankly, i'm astounded professor mcgonagall thinks allthese security measures are necessary
	i agree, sir, said harry, making ron drop his books in surprise
	thank you, harry, said lockhart graciously while they waited for along line of hufflepuffs to pass
	i mean, we teachers have quiteenough to be getting on with, without walking students to classes andstanding guard all night
	that's right, said ron, catching on
	why don't you leave us here, sir,we've only got one more corridor to go you know, weasley, i think i will, said lockhart
	i really should goand prepare my next class and he hurried off
	prepare his class, ron sneered after him
	gone to curl his hair,more like
	they let the rest of the gryffindors draw ahead of them, then darteddown a side passage and hurried off toward moaning myrtle'sbathroom
	but just as they were congratulating each other on theirbrilliant schemepotter weasley what are you doingit was professor mcgonagall, and her mouth was the thinnest of thinlines
	we were we were ron stammered
	we were going to  to go andsee hermione, said harry
	ron and professor mcgonagall both lookedat him
	we haven't seen her for ages, professor, harry went on hurriedly,treading on ron's foot, and we thought we'd sneak into the hospitalwing, you know, and tell her the mandrakes are nearly ready and, er,not to worry professor mcgonagall was still staring at him, and for a moment,harry thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was ina strangely croaky voice
	of course, she said, and harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in herbeady eye
	of course, i realize this has all been hardest on the friendsof those who have been
	yes,potter, of course you may visit miss granger
	i will inform professorbinns where you've gone
	tell madam pomfrey i have given mypermission
	harry and ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they'davoided detention
	as they turned the corner, they distinctly heardprofessor mcgonagall blow her nose
	that, said ron fervently, was the best story you've ever come upwith
	they had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell madampomfrey that they had professor mcgonagall's permission to visithermione
	madam pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly
	there's just no point talking to a petrified
	person, she said, and theyhad to admit she had a point when they'd taken their seats next tohermione
	it was plain that hermione didn't have the faintest inklingthat she had visitors, and that they might just as well tell her bedsidecabinet not to worry for all the good it would do
	wonder if she did see the attacker, though said ron, looking sadlyat hermione's rigid face
	because if he sneaked up on them all, noone'll ever know
	but harry wasn't looking at hermione's face
	he was more interestedin her right hand
	it lay clenched on top of her blankets, and bendingcloser, he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside her fist
	making sure that madam pomfrey was nowhere near, he pointed thisout to ron
	tg and get it out, ron whispered, shifting his chair so that heblocked harry from madam pomfrey's view
	hermione's hand was clamped so tightly aroundthe paper that harry was sure he was going to tear it
	while ron keptwatch he tugged and twisted, and at last, after several tense minutes,the paper came free
	it was a page torn from a very old library book
	harry smoothed it outeagerly and ron leaned close to read it, too
	of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land,there is none more curious or more deadly than the basilisk,known also as the king of serpents
	this snake, which mayreach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is bornfrom a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad
	its methods of killing aremost wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the basiliskhas a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shallsuffer instant death
	spiders flee before the basilisk, for it is their mortalenemy, and the basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which isfatal to it
	and beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand harryrecognized as hermione's
	it was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain
	the monster in thechamber's a basilisk  a giant serpent that why i've been hearingthat voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it
	it's becausei understand parseltongue
	harry looked up at the beds around him
	the basilisk kills people by looking at them
	but no one's died because no one looked it straight in the eye
	colin saw it through hiscamera
	the basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but colin just gotpetrified
	justin must've seen the basilisk through nearlyheadless nick nick got the full blast of it, but he couldn't die again
	and hermione and that ravenclaw prefect were found with amirror next to them
	hermione had just realized the monster was abasilisk
	i bet you anything she warned the first person she met tolook around corners with a mirror first and that girl pulled out hermirror  and rods jaw had dropped
	norris he whispered eagerly
	harry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of halloween
	the flood from moaning myrtle'sbathroom
	norris only saw the reflection
	he scanned the page in his hand eagerly
	the more he looked at it,the more it made sense
	the crowing of the rooster
	is fatal to it he read aloud
	hagrid'sroosters were killed the heir of slytherin didn't want one anywherenear the castle once the chamber was opened spidersflee before it
	itall fitsbut how's the basilisk been getting around the place said ron
	someone would've seen
	harry, however, pointed at the word hermione had scribbled at thefoot of the page
	ron, it's been using the plumbing
	i'vebeen hearing that voice inside the walls
	ron suddenly grabbed harry's arm
	the entrance to the chamber of secrets he said hoarsely
	what if it's a bathroom what if it's in  moaning myrtle's bathroom, said harry
	they sat there, excitement coursing through them, hardly ableto believe it
	this means, said harry, i can't be the only parselmouth inthe school
	the heir of slytherin's one, too
	that's how he's beencontrolling the basilisk
	what're we going to do said ron, whose eyes were flashing
	should we go straight to mcgonagalllet's go to the staff room, said harry, jumping up
	she'll bethere in ten minutes
	not wanting to be discovered hangingaround in another corridor, they went straight into the desertedstaff room
	it was a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs
	harry and ron paced around it, too excited to sit down
	but the bell to signal break never came
	instead, echoing through the corridors came professor mcgonagall's voice, magically magnified
	all students to return to their house dormitories at once
	all teachers return to the staff room
	harry wheeled around to stare at ron
	not another attack not nowwhat'll we do said ron, aghast
	go back to the dormitoryno, said harry, glancing around
	there was an ugly sort ofwardrobe to his left, full of the teachers' cloaks
	let's hearwhat it's all about
	then we can tell them what we've found out
	they hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds ofpeople moving overhead, and the staff room door banging open
	from between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched theteachers filtering into the room
	some of them were looking puzzled,others downright scared
	then professor mcgonagall arrived
	it has happened, she told the silent staff room
	a student has beentaken by the monster
	right into the chamber itself
	professor flitwick let out a squeal
	professor sprout clapped herhands over her mouth
	snape gripped the back of a chair very hardand said, how can you be surethe heir of slytherin, said professor mcgonagall, who was verywhite, left another message
	right underneath the first one
	herskeleton will lie in the chamber forever
	'professor flitwick burst into tears
	who is it said madam hooch, who had sunk, weakkneed, into achair
	which studentginny weasley, said professor mcgonagall
	harry felt ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor besidehim
	we shall have to send all the students home tomorrow, saidprofessor mcgonagall
	this is the end of hogwarts
	dumbledorealways said
	the staffroom door banged open again
	for one wild moment,harry was sure it would be dumbledore
	but it was lockhart, andhe was beaming
	so sorry  dozed off  what have i missedhe didn't seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at himwith something remarkably like hatred
	snape stepped forward
	just the man, he said
	a girl has been snatched bythe monster, lockhart
	taken into the chamber of secrets itself
	yourmoment has come at last
	that's right, gilderoy, chipped in professor sprout
	weren't yousaying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance tothe chamber of secrets isi  well, i sputtered lockhart
	yes, didn't you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside itpiped up professor flitwick
	ddid i i don't recall i certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn't had acrack at the monster before hagrid was arrested, said snape
	didn'tyou say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you shouldhave been given a free rein from the firstlockhart stared around at his stonyfaced colleagues
	i  i really never  you may have misunderstood we'll leave it to you, then, gilderoy, said professor mcgonagall
	tonight will be an excellent time to do it
	we'll make sure everyone'sout of your way
	you'll be able to tackle the monster all by youself
	lockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody came to therescue
	he didn't look remotely handsome anymore
	his lip wastrembling, and in the absence of his usually toothy grin, he lookedweakchinned and feeble
	i'll  i'll be in my office, getting getting ready
	right, said professor mcgonagall, whose nostrils were flared,that's got him out from under our feet
	the heads of houses shouldgo and inform their students what has happened
	tell them thehogwarts express will take them home first thing tomorrow
	will therest of you please make sure no students have been left outside theirdormitories
	the teachers rose and left, one by one
	it was probably the worst day of harry's entire life
	he, ron, fred,and george sat together in a corner of the gryffindor common room,unable to say anything to each other
	he had goneto send an owl to mr
	weasley, then shut himself up in hisdormitory
	no afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had gryffindortower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet
	near sunset, fred andgeorge went up to bed, unable to sit there any longer
	she knew something, harry, said ron, speaking for the first timesince they had entered the wardrobe in the staff room
	that's whyshe was taken
	it wasn't some stupid thing about percy at all
	, she'dfound out something about the chamber of secrets
	that must be whyshe was  ron rubbed his eyes frantically
	i mean, she was a pureblood
	there can't be any other reason
	harry could see the sun sinking, bloodred, below the skyline
	this wasthe worst he had ever felt
	if only there was something they could do
	d'you think there's any chance at all she's not  youknow harry didn't know what to say
	he couldn't see how ginny could stillbe alive
	d'you know what said ron
	i think we should go and seelockhart
	tell him what we know
	he's going to try and get into thechamber
	we can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it's abasilisk in there
	because harry couldn't think of anything else to do, and because hewanted to be doing something, he agreed
	the gryffindors aroundthem were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the weasleys, thatnobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, and leftthrough the portrait hole
	darkness was falling as they walked down to lockhart's office
	there seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it
	they could hearscraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps
	harry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside
	then thedoor opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of lockhart's eyespeering through it
	weasley  he said, opening the door a bitwider
	i'm rather busy at the moment  if you would be quick professor, we've got some information for you, said harry
	wethink it'll help you
	er  well  it's not terribly  the side of lockhart's face that theycould see looked very uncomfortable
	i mean  well all right he opened the door and they entered
	his office had been almost completely stripped
	two large trunksstood open on the floor
	robes, jadegreen, lilac, midnightblue, hadbeen hastily folded into one of them books were jumbled untidily intothe other
	the photographs that had covered the walls were nowcrammed into boxes on the desk
	are you going somewhere said harry
	er, well, yes, said lockhart, ripping a lifesize poster of himself fromthe back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up
	urgent call unavoidable  got to go what about my sister said ron jerkily
	well, as to that  most unfortunate  said lockhart, avoiding theireyes as he wrenched open a drawer and started emptying the contentsinto a bag
	no one regrets more than i you're the defense against the dark arts teacher said harry
	you can't go now not with all the dark stuff going on herewell  i must say  when i took the job  lockhart muttered, nowpiling socks on top of his robes
	nothing in the job description  didn'texpect you mean you're running away said harry disbelievingly
	after allthat stuff you did in your books books can be misleading, said lockhart delicately
	you wrote them harry shouted
	my dear boy, said lockhart, straightening up and frowning at harry
	do use your common sense
	my books wouldn't have sold half aswell if people didn't think id done all those things
	no one wants toread about some ugly old armenian warlock, even if he did save avillage from werewolves
	he'd look dreadful on the front cover
	nodress sense at all
	and the witch who banished the bandon bansheehad a harelip
	i mean, come on so you've just been taking credit for what a load of other people havedone said harry incredulously
	harry, harry, said lockhart, shaking his head impatiently, it's notnearly as simple as that
	there was work involved
	i hadto track these people down
	ask them exactly how they managed todo what they did
	then i had to put a memory charm on them so theywouldn't remember doing it
	if there's one thing i pride myself on, it'smy memory charms
	no, it's been a lot of work, harry
	it's not allbook signings and publicity photos, you know
	you want fame, youhave to be prepared for a long hard slog
	he banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them
	i think that's everything
	he pulled out his wand and turned to them
	awfully sorry, boys, but i'll have to put a memory charm on younow
	can't have you blabbing my secrets all over the place
	id neversell another book harry reached his wand just in time
	lockhart had barely raised his,when harry bellowed, expelliarmuslockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk his wand flewhigh into the air ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window
	shouldn't have let professor snape teach us that one, said harryfuriously, kicking lockhart's trunk aside
	lockhart was looking up athim, feeble once more
	harry was still pointing his wand at him
	what d'you want me to do said lockhart weakly
	i don't knowwhere the chamber of secrets is
	there's nothing i can do
	you're in luck, said harry, forcing lockhart to his feet at wandpoint
	we think we know where it is
	and what's inside it
	they marched lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairs,along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall, to thedoor of moaning myrtle's bathroom
	they sent lockhart in first
	harry was pleased to see that he wasshaking
	moaning myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet
	oh, it's you, she said when she saw harry
	what do you want thistimeto ask you how you died, said harry
	myrtle's whole aspect changed at once
	she looked as though she hadnever been asked such a flattering question
	ooooh, it was dreadful, she said with relish
	it happened right inhere
	i died in this very stall
	i remember it so well
	id hidden becauseolive hornby was teasing me about my glasses
	the door was locked,and i was crying, and then i heard somebody come in
	they saidsomething funny
	a different language, i think it must have been
	anyway, what really got me was that it was a boy speaking
	so iunlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own toilet, and then myrtle swelled importantly, her face shining
	no idea, said myrtle in hushed tones
	i just remember seeing a pairof great, big, yellow eyes
	my whole body sort of seized up, and then iwas floating away
	she looked dreamily at harry
	and then icame back again
	i was determined to haunt olive hornby, you see
	oh, she was sorry she'd ever laughed at my glasses
	where exactly did you see the eyes said harry
	somewhere there, said myrtle, pointing vaguely toward the sink infront of her toilet
	harry and ron hurried over to it
	lockhart was standing well back, alook of utter terror on his face
	it looked like an ordinary sink
	they examined every inch of it, insideand out, including the pipes below
	and then harry saw it scratchedon the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake
	that tap's never worked, said myrtle brightly as he tried to turn it
	something in parseltongue
	but  harry thought hard
	the only times he'd ever managed tospeak parseltongue were when he'd been faced with a real snake
	hestared hard at the tiny engraving, trying to imagine it was real
	he looked at ron, who shook his head
	harry looked back at the snake, willing himself to believe it was alive
	if he moved his head, the candlelight made it look as though it weremoving
	except that the words weren't what he heard a strange hissing hadescaped him, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light andbegan to spin
	next second, the sink began to move the sink, in fact,sank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a pipe wideenough for a man to slide into
	harry heard ron gasp and looked up again
	he had made up his mindwhat he was going to do
	i'm going down there, he said
	he couldn't not go, not now they had found the entrance to thechamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chancethat ginny might be alive
	well, you hardly seem to need me, said lockhart, with a shadowof his old smile
	i'll just he put his hand on the door knob, but ron and harry both pointedtheir wands at him
	you can go first, ron snarled
	whitefaced and wandless, lockhart approached the opening
	boys, he said, his voice feeble
	boys, what good will it doharry jabbed him in the back with his wand
	lockhart slid his legsinto the pipe
	i really don't think  he started to say, but ron gave him a push,and he slid out of sight
	harry followed quickly
	he lowered himselfslowly into the pipe, then let go
	it was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide
	he could seemore pipes branching off in all directions, but none as large as theirs,which twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and he knewthat he was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeons
	behind him he could hear ron, thudding slightly at the curves
	and then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happenwhen he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of theend with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnellarge enough to stand in
	lockhart was getting to hisfeet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost
	harrystood aside as ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too
	we must be miles under the school, said harry, his voice echoing inthe black tunnel
	under the lake, probably, said ron, squinting around at the dark,slimy walls
	all three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead
	lumos harry muttered to his wand and it lit again
	c'mon, hesaid to ron and lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps slappingloudly on the wet floor
	the tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead
	their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight
	remember, harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward,any sign of movement, close your eyes right away
	but the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected soundthey heard was a loud crunch as ron stepped on what turned out to bea rat's skull
	harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw thatit was littered with small animal bones
	trying very hard not toimagine what ginny might look like if they found her, harry led theway forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel
	harry  there's something up there  said ron hoarsely, grabbingharry's shoulder
	harry could just see the outline of somethinghuge and curved, lying right across the tunnel
	maybe it's asleep, he breathed, glancing back at the other two
	lockhart's hands were pressed over his eyes
	harry turned back tolook at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt
	very slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see,harry edged forward, his wand held high
	the light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green,lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor
	the creature that hadshed it must have been twenty feet long at least
	blimey, said ron weakly
	there was a sudden movement behind them
	gilderoy lockhart'sknees had given way
	get up, said ron sharply, pointing his wand at lockhart
	lockhart got to his feet  then he dived at ron, knocking him to theground
	harry jumped forward, but too late  lockhart was straightening up,panting, ron's wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on hisface
	the adventure ends here, boys he said
	i shall take a bit of thisskin back up to the school, tell them i was too late to save the girl,and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of hermangled body  say goodbye to your memorieshe raised ron's spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled,obliviatethe wand exploded with the force of a small bomb
	harry flung hisarms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, outof the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering tothe floor
	next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wallof broken rock
	are you okay roni'm here came ron's muffled voice from behind the rockfall
	i'mokay  this git's not, though  he got blasted by the wand 'there was a dull thud and a loud ow it sounded as though ron hadjust kicked lockhart in the shins
	what now ron's voice said, sounding desperate
	we can't getthrough  it'll take ages
	harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling
	huge cracks had appeared in it
	he had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks bymagic, and now didn't seem a good moment to try  what if the wholetunnel caved inthere was another thud and another ow from behind the rocks
	they were wasting time
	ginny had already been in the chamber ofsecrets for hours
	harry knew there was only one thing to do
	wait there, he called to ron
	if i'mnot back in an hour
	there was a very pregnant pause,i'll try and shift some of this rock, said ron, who seemed to be tryingto keep his voice steady
	so you can  can get back through
	and,harry see you in a bit, said harry, trying to inject some confidence into hisshaking voice
	and he set off alone past the giant snake skin
	soon the distant noise of ron straining to shift the rocks was gone
	the tunnel turned and turned again
	every nerve in harry's body wastingling unpleasantly
	he wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded whathe'd find when it did
	and then, at last, as he crept around yet anotherbend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents werecarved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds
	harry approached, his throat very dry
	there was no need to pretendthese stone snakes were real their eyes looked strangely alive
	he could guess what he had to do
	he cleared his throat, and theemerald eyes seemed to flicker
	open, said harry, in a low, faint hiss
	the serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothlyout of sight, and harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside
	c h a p t e r   s e v e n t e e n the heir of slytherinhe was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber
	toweringstone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support aceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd,greenish gloom that filled the place
	his heart beating very fast, harry stood listening to the chill silence
	could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar andwhere was ginnyhe pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentinecolumns
	every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls
	he kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallestsign of movement
	the hollow eye sockets of the stone snakesseemed to be following him
	more than once, with a jolt of thestomach, he thought he saw one stir
	then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as thechamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall
	harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above itwas ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost tothe bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where twoenormous gray feet stood on the smooth chamber floor
	and betweenthe feet, facedown, lay a small, blackrobed figure with flamingredhair
	ginny harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees
	ginny  don't be dead  please don't be dead  he flung his wandaside, grabbed ginny's shoulders, and turned her over
	her face waswhite as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn'tpetrified
	but then she must beginny, please wake up, harry muttered desperately, shaking her
	ginny's head lolled hopelessly from side to side
	she won't wake, said a soft voice
	harry jumped and spun around on his knees
	a tall, blackhaired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar,watching
	he was strangely blurred around the edges, as thoughharry were looking at him through a misted window
	but there wasno mistaking himtom  tom riddleriddle nodded, not taking his eyes off harry's face
	what d'you mean, she won't wake harry said desperately
	she'snot  she's not she's still alive, said riddle
	tom riddle had been at hogwarts fifty yearsago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a dayolder than sixteen
	are you a ghost harry said uncertainly
	a memory, said riddle quietly
	preserved in a diary for fifty years
	he pointed toward the floor near the statue's giant toes
	lying openthere was the little black diary harry had found in moaning myrtle'sbathroom
	for a second, harry wondered how it had got there  butthere were more pressing matters to deal with
	you've got to help me, tom, harry said, raising ginny's head again
	we've got to get her out of here
	i don't knowwhere it is, but it could be along any moment
	please, help me 1riddle didn't move
	harry, sweating, managed to hoist ginny half offthe floor, and bent to pick up his wand again
	but his wand had gone
	did you see he looked up
	riddle was still watching him  twirling harry's wandbetween his long fingers
	thanks, said harry, stretching out his hand for it
	a smile curled the corners of riddle's mouth
	he continued to stare atharry, twirling the wand idly
	listen, said harry urgently, his knees sagging with ginny's deadweight
	we've got to go if the basilisk comes it won't come until it is called, said riddle calmly
	harry lowered ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up anylonger
	what d'you mean he said
	look, give me my wand, i might need itriddle's smile broadened
	you won't be needing it, he said
	what d'you mean, i won't be i've waited a long time for this, harry potter, said riddle
	for thechance to see you
	look, said harry, losing patience, i don't think you get it
	we're inthe chamber of secrets
	we can talk later we're going to talk now, said riddle, still smiling broadly, and hepocketed harry's wand
	there was something very funny going on here
	how did ginny get like this he asked slowly
	well, that's an interesting question, said riddle pleasantly
	and quitea long story
	i suppose the real reason ginny weasley's like this isbecause she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisiblestranger
	what are you talking about said harry
	the diary, said riddle
	little ginny's been writing in it formonths and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes  howher brothers tease her, how she had to come to school withsecondhand robes and books, how riddle's eyes glinted how shedidn't think famous, good, great harry potter would ever like her
	all the time he spoke, riddle's eyes never left harry's face
	therewas an almost hungry look in them
	it's very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an elevenyearold girl, he went on
	i wassympathetic, i was kind
	ginny simply loved me
	no one's everunderstood me like you, tom
	i'm so glad i've got this diary toconfide in
	it's like having a friend i can carry around in my pocket
	riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn't suit him
	it made the hairsstand up on the back of harry's neck
	if i say it myself, harry, i've always been able to charm the people ineeded
	so ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened tobe exactly what i wanted
	i grew stronger and stronger on a diet ofher deepest fears, her darkest secrets
	i grew powerful, far morepowerful than little miss weasley
	powerful enough to start feedingmiss weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soulback into her
	what d'you mean said harry, whose mouth had gone very dry
	haven't you guessed yet, harry potter said riddle softly
	ginnyweasley opened the chamber of secrets
	she strangled the schoolroosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls
	she set theserpent of slytherin on four mudbloods, and the squib's cat
	yes, said riddle, calmly
	of course, she didn't know what she wasdoing at first
	i wish you could have seen hernew diary entries
	far more interesting, they became
	dear tom,he recited, watching harry's horrified face, i think i'm losing mymemory
	there are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 don't know howthey got there
	dear tom, l can't remember what 1 did on the night ofhalloween, but a cat was attacked and i've got paint all down my front
	dear tom, percy keeps telling me i'm pale and i'm not myself
	i think hesuspects me
	there was another attack todayand i don't know where i was
	tom, what am i going to do i think i'mgoing mad
	i think i'm the one attacking everyone, tomharry's fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his palms
	it took a very long time for stupid little ginny to stop trusting herdiary, said riddle
	but she finally became suspicious and tried todispose of it
	and that's where you came in, harry
	you found it, and icouldn't have been more delighted
	of all the people who could havepicked it up, it was you, the very person i was most anxious to meet
	and why did you want to meet me said harry
	anger was coursingthrough him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady
	well, you see, ginny told me all about you, harry, said riddle
	yourwhole fascinating history
	his eyes roved over the lightning scar onharry's forehead, and their expression grew hungrier
	i knew i mustfind out more about you, talk to you, meet you if i could
	so i decidedto show you my famous capture of that great oaf, hagrid, to gain yourtrust hagrid's my friend, said harry, his voice now shaking
	and youframed him, didn't you i thought you made a mistake, but riddle laughed his high laugh again
	it was my word against hagrid's, harry
	well, you can imagine howit looked to old armando dippet
	on the one hand, tom riddle, poorbut brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student
	on the other hand, big, blundering hagrid, in trouble every other week,trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed, sneaking off to theforbidden forest to wrestle trolls
	but iadmit, even i was surprised how well the plan worked
	i thoughtsomeone must realize that hagrid couldn't possibly be the heir ofslytherin
	it had taken me five whole years to find out everything icould about the chamber of secrets and discover the secret entrance
	as though hagrid had the brains, or the poweronly the transfiguration teacher, dumbledore, seemed to thinkhagrid was innocent
	he persuaded dipper to keep hagrid and trainhim as gamekeeper
	yes, i think dumbledore might have guessed
	dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachersdid
	i bet dumbledore saw right through you, said harry, his teeth gritted
	well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after hagridwas expelled, said riddle carelessly
	i knew it wouldn't be safe toopen the chamber again while i was still at school
	but i wasn't goingto waste those long years id spent searching for it
	i decided to leavebehind a diary, preserving my sixteenyearold self in its pages, so thatone day, with luck, i would be able to lead another in my footsteps, andfinish salazar slytherin's noble work
	well, you haven't finished it, said harry triumphantly
	no one's diedthis time, not even the cat
	in a few hours the mandrake draught willbe ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again haven't i already told you, said riddle quietly, that killing mudbloodsdoesn't matter to me anymore for many months now, my new targethas been you
	imagine how angry i was when the next time my diary wasopened, it was ginny who was writing to me, not you
	she saw youwith the diary, you see, and panicked
	what if you found out how towork it, and i repeated all her secrets to you what if, even worse, itold you who'd been strangling roosters so the foolish little brat waiteduntil your dormitory was deserted and stole it back
	but i knew what imust do
	it was clear to me that you were on the trail of slytherin'sheir
	from everything ginny had told me about you, i knew you wouldgo to any lengths to solve the mystery particularly if one of your best friends was attacked
	and ginny hadtold me the whole school was buzzing because you could speakparseltongue
	so i made ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come downhere to wait
	she struggled and cried and became very boring
	butthere isn't much life left in her
	she put too much into the diary, intome
	enough to let me leave its pages at last
	i have been waiting foryou to appear since we arrived here
	i have manyquestions for you, harry potter
	like what harry spat, fists still clenched
	well, said riddle, smiling pleasantly, how is it that you a skinny boywith no extraordinary magical talent  managed to defeat the greatestwizard of all time how did you escape with nothing but a scar, whilelord voldemort's powers were destroyedthere was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now
	why do you care how i escaped said harry slowly
	voldemort wasafter your time
	voldemort, said riddle softly, is my past, present, and future, harrypotter
	he pulled harry's wand from his pocket and began to trace itthrough the air, writing three shimmering wordstom marvolo riddlethen he waved the wand once, and the letters of his namerearranged themselvesi am lord voldemortyou see he whispered
	it was a name i was already using athogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course
	you think iwas going to use my filthy muggle father's name forever i, in whoseveins runs the blood of salazar slytherin himself, through mymother's side i, keep the name of a foul, common muggle, whoabandoned me even before i was born, just because he found out hiswife was a witch no, harry  i fashioned myself a new name, aname i knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when i had become the greatest sorcerer in the worldharry's brain seemed to have jammed
	he stared numbly at riddle,at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder harry's ownparents, and so many others
	at last he forced himself to ,peak
	you're not, he said, his quiet voice full of hatred
	not what snapped riddle
	not the greatest sorcerer in the world, said harry, breathing fast
	sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in theworld is albus dumbledore
	even when you werestrong, you didn't dare try and take over at hogwarts
	dumbledoresaw through you when you were at school and he still frightens younow, wherever you're hiding these days the smile had gone from riddle's face, to be replaced by a very uglylook
	dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory ofme he hissed
	he's not as gone as you might think harry retorted
	he wasspeaking at random, wanting to scare riddle, wishing rather thanbelieving it to be trueriddle opened his mouth, but froze
	music was coming from somewhere
	riddle whirled around to staredown the empty chamber
	the music was growing louder
	it waseerie, spinetingling, unearthly it lifted the hair on harry's scalp andmade his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size
	then, as the music reached such a pitch that harry felt it vibratinginside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar
	a crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird musicto the vaulted ceiling
	it had a glittering golden tail as long as apeacock's and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a raggedbundle
	a second later, the bird was flying straight at harry
	it dropped theragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on hisshoulder
	as it folded its great wings, harry looked up and saw it had along, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye
	the bird stopped singing
	it sat still and warm next to harry's cheek,gazing steadily at riddle
	that's a phoenix said riddle, staring shrewdly back at it
	fawkes harry breathed, and he felt the bird's golden clawssqueeze his shoulder gentlyand that  said riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that fawkes haddropped, that's the old school sorting hat so it was
	patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at harry'sfeet
	riddle began to laugh again
	he laughed so hard that the darkchamber rang with it, as though ten riddles were laughing at oncethis is what dumbledore sends his defender a songbird and an oldhat do you feel brave, harry potter do you feel safe nowharry didn't answer
	he might not see what use fawkes or thesorting hat were, but he was no longer alone, and he waited forriddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting
	to business, harry, said riddle, still smiling broadly
	twice  in yourpast, in my future  we have met
	and twice i failed to kill you
	howdid you survive tell me everything
	the longer you talk, he addedsoftly, the longer you stay alive
	harry was thinking fast, weighing his chances
	he, harry, had fawkes and the sorting hat, neither of which wouldbe much good in a duel
	it looked bad, all right
	but the longer riddlestood there, the more life was dwindling out of ginny
	and in themeantime, harry noticed suddenly, riddle's outline was becomingclearer, more solid
	if it had to be a fight between him and riddle,better sooner than later
	no one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,said harry abruptly
	i don't know myself but i know why youcouldn't kill me
	because my mother died to save me
	my commonmuggleborn mother, he added, shaking with suppressed rage
	shestopped you killing me
	and i've seen the real you, i saw you lastyear
	that's where all yourpower got you
	you're ugly, you're foul riddle's face contorted
	then he forced it into an awful smile
	your mother died to save you
	yes, that's a powerful countercharm
	there is nothing special about you, after all
	there are strange likenesses between us, after all
	even you must have noticed
	both halfbloods, orphans, raised bymuggles
	probably the only two parselmouths to come to hogwartssince the great slytherin himself we even look something alike
	butafter all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me
	that'sall i wanted to know
	harry stood, tense, waiting for riddle to raise his wand
	but riddle'stwisted smile was widening again
	now, harry, i'm going to teach you a little lesson
	let's match thepowers of lord voldemort, heir of salazar slytherin, against famousharry potter, and the best weapons dumbledore can give him
	he cast an amused eye over fawkes and the sorting hat, then walkedaway
	harry, fear spreading up his numb legs, watched ridthe stopbetween the high pillars and look up into the stone face of slytherin,high above him in the halfdarkness
	riddle opened his mouth wide andhissed  but harry understood what he was saying
	speak to me, slytherin, greatest of the hogwarts four
	harry wheeled around to look up at the statue, fawkes swaying on hisshoulder
	slytherin's gigantic stone face was moving
	horrorstruck, harry sawhis mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole
	and something was stirring inside the statue's mouth
	somethingwas slithering up from its depths
	harry backed away until he hit the dark chamber wall, and as he shuthis eyes tight he felt fawkes' wing sweep his cheek as he took flight
	harry wanted to shout, don't leave me but what chance did aphoenix have against the king of serpentssomething huge hit the stone floor of the chamber
	harry felt itshudder  he knew what was happening, he could sense it, couldalmost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from slytherin's mouth
	then he heard riddle's hissing voicekill him
	the basilisk was moving toward harry he could hear its heavy bodyslithering heavily across the dusty floor
	eyes still tightly shut, harrybegan to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way voldemort was laughingharry tripped
	he fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpentwas barely feet from him, he could hear it comingthere was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and thensomething heavy hit harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall
	waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing,something thrashing wildly off the pillarshe couldn't help it  he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at whatwas going on
	the enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk,had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weavingdrunkenly between the pillars
	as harry trembled, ready to close hiseyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake
	fawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snappingfuriously at him with fangs long and thin as sabersfawkes dived
	his long golden beak sank out of sight and asudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor
	the snake's tailthrashed, narrowly missing harry, and before harry could shut hiseyes, it turned  harry looked straight into its face and saw that itseyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by thephoenix blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spittingin agony
	no harry heard riddle screaming
	leave the bird leavethe bird the boy is behind you
	you can still smellhim
	kill himthe blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly
	fawkes wascircling its head, piping his eerie song, jabbing here and there at itsscaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes
	help me, help me, harry muttered wildly, someone  anyonethe snake's tail whipped across the floor again
	something soft hit his face
	the basilisk had swept the sorting hat into harry's arms
	it was all he had left, his only chance  he rammed it onto hishead and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk's tail swungover him again
	help me  help me  harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the hat
	please help methere was no answering voice
	instead, the hat contracted, as thoughan invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly
	something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of harry's head,almost knocking him out
	stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbedthe top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hardbeneath it
	a gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handleglittering with rubies the size of eggs
	kill the boy leave the bird the boy is behind you
	harry was on his feet, ready
	the basilisk's head was falling, its bodycoiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him
	he could see thevast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enoughto swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his sword, thin,glittering, venomous it lunged blindly  harry dodged and it hit the chamber wall
	it lungedagain, and its forked tongue lashed harry's side
	he raised the swordin both his hands the basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true  harry threwhis whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roofof the serpent's mouth but as warm blood drenched harry's arms, he felt a searing pain justabove his elbow
	one long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper anddeeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled oversideways and fell, twitching, to the floor
	harry slid down the wall
	he gripped the fang that was spreadingpoison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm
	but he knew itwas too late
	whitehot pain was spreading slowly and steadily fromthe wound
	even as he dropped the fang and watched his own bloodsoaking his robes, his vision went foggy
	the chamber was dissolvingin a whirl of dull color
	a patch of scarlet swam past, and harry heard a soft clatter of clawsbeside him
	fawkes, said harry thickly
	you were fantastic, fawkes
	he felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent'sfang had pierced him
	he could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved infront of him
	you're dead, harry potter, said riddle's voice above him
	even dumbledore's bird knows it
	do you see what he's doing, potterhe's crying
	fawke's head slid in and out of focus
	thick, pearly tearswere trickling down the glossy feathers
	i'm going to sit here and watch you die, harry potter
	everything around him seemed to be spinning
	so ends the famous harry potter, said riddle's distant voice
	alonein the chamber of secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last bythe dark lord he so unwisely challenged
	you'll be back with your dearmudblood mother soon, harry
	she bought you twelve years ofborrowed time
	but lord voldemort got you in the end, as you knewhe must
	if this is dying, thought harry, it's not so bad
	even the pain was leaving him
	but was this dying instead of going black, the chamber seemed to becoming back into focus
	harry gave his head a little shake and there wasfawkes, still resting his head on harry's arm
	a pearly patch of tears wasshining all around the wound  except that there was no woundget away, bird, said riddle's voice suddenly
	get away from him i said, get away harry raised his head
	riddle was pointing harry's wand atfawkes there was a bang like a gun, and fawkes took flight again in awhirl of gold and scarlet
	said riddle quietly, staring at harry's arm
	he looked into harry's face
	but it makes no difference
	in fact, iprefer it this way
	just you and me, harry potter
	he raised the wandthen, in a rush of wings, fawkes had soared back overhead andsomething fell into harry's lap  the diary
	for a split second, both harry and riddle, wand still raised, stared at it
	then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant todo it all along, harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to himand plunged it straight into the heart of the book
	there was a long, dreadful, piercing scream
	ink spurted out of thediary in torrents, streaming over harry's hands, flooding the floor
	riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and thenhe had gone
	harry's wand fell to the floor with a clatter and therewas silence
	silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozingfrom the diary
	the basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole rightthrough it
	shaking all over, harry pulled himself up
	his head was spinning asthough he'd just traveled miles by floo powder
	slowly, he gatheredtogether his wand and the sorting hat, and, with a huge tug, retrievedthe glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk's mouth
	then came a faint moan from the end of the chamber
	as harry hurried toward her, she sat up
	her bemusedeyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over harry, inhis bloodsoaked robes, then to the diary in his hand
	she drew a great,shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face
	harry  oh, harry  i tried to tell you at bbreakfast, but i ccouldn'tsay it in front of percy  it was me, harry  but i  i sswear i ddiddt mean to  rriddle made me, he ttook me over  and  howdid you kill that  that thing wwhere's riddle the last thing i rremember is him coming out of the diary  it's all right, said harry, holding up the diary, and showing ginny thefang hole, riddle's finished
	look him and the basilisk
	c'mon,ginny, let's get out of here i'm going to be expelled ginny wept as harry helped herawkwardly to her feet
	i've looked forward to coming to hogwartsever since bbill came and nnow i'll have to leave and  wwhat'llmum and dad sayfawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the chamber entrance
	harry urged ginny forward they stepped over the motionless coils ofthe dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel
	harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss
	after a few minutes' progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound ofslowly shifting rock reached harry's ears
	ron harry yelled, speeding up
	ginny's okay i've got herhe heard ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend tosee his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed tomake in the rock fall
	ginny ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pullher through first
	you're alive i don't believe it what happenedhow  what  where did that bird come fromfawkes had swooped through the gap after ginny
	he's dumbledore's, said harry, squeezing through himselfhow come you've got a sword said ron, gaping at the glitteringweapon in harry's hand
	i'll explain when we get out of here, said harry with a sidewaysglance at ginny, who was crying harder than ever
	but later, harry said shortly
	he didn't think it was a good idea to tellron yet who'd been opening the chamber, not in front of ginny,anyway
	where's lockhartback there, said ron, still looking puzzled but jerking his head up thetunnel toward the pipe
	led by fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glowin the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe
	gilderoy lockhart was sitting there, humming placidly to himself
	his memory's gone, said ron
	the memory charm backfired
	hithim instead of us
	hasn't got a clue who he is, or where he is, or whowe are
	i told him to come and wait here
	he's a danger to himselflockhart peered goodnaturedly up at them all
	odd sort of place, this, isn't it do you live hereno, said ron, raising his eyebrows at harry
	harry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe
	have you thought how we're going to get back up this he said toron
	ron shook his head, but fawkes the phoenix had swooped past harryand was now fluttering in front of him, his beady eyes bright in thedark
	he was waving his long golden tail feathers
	harry lookeduncertainly at him
	he looks like he wants you to grab hold
	said ron, lookingperplexed
	but you're much too heavy for a bird to pull up there fawkes, said harry, isn't an ordinary bird
	he turned quickly to theothers
	we've got to hold on to each other
	ginny, grab ron's hand
	professor lockhart he means you, said ron sharply to lockhart
	you hold ginny's other hand harry tucked the sword and the sorting hat into his belt, ron tookhold of the back of harry's robes, and harry reached out and tookhold of fawkes's strangely hot tail feathers
	an extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole bodyand the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying upwardthrough the pipe
	harry could hear lockhart dangling below him,saying, amazing amazing this is just like magic the chill air waswhipping through harry's hair, and before he'd stopped enjoying theride, it was over  all four of them were hitting the wet floor ofmoaning myrtle's bathroom, and as lockhart straightened his hat, thesink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place
	myrtle goggled at them
	you're alive, she said blankly to harry
	there's no need to sound so disappointed, he said grimly, wipingflecks of blood and slime off his glasses
	id just been thinking
	if you had died, you'd have beenwelcome to share my toilet, said myrtle, blushing silver
	urgh said ron as they left the bathroom for the dark, desertedcorridor outside
	harry i think myrtle's grown fond of you you'vegot competition, ginnybut tears were still flooding silently down ginny's face
	where now said ron, with an anxious look at ginny
	fawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor
	theystrode after him, and moments later, found themselves outsideprofessor mcgonagall's office
	harry knocked and pushed the door open
	c h a p t e r   e i g h t e e ndobby's rewardfor a moment there was silence as harry, ron, ginny, and lockhartstood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and in harry's caseblood
	then there was a scream
	weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the fire
	she leapt to her feet, closely followed by mr
	weasley, and both ofthem flung themselves on their daughter
	harry, however, was looking past them
	professor dumbledore wasstanding by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to professor mcgonagall,who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest
	fawkeswent whooshing past harry's ear and settled on dumbledore'sshoulder, just as harry found himself and ron being swept into mrs
	weasleys tight embrace
	you saved her you saved her how did you do iti think we'd all like to know that, said professor mcgonagall weakly
	weasley let go of harry, who hesitated for a moment, thenwalked over to the desk and laid upon it the sorting hat, therubyencrusted sword, and what remained of riddle's diary
	then he started telling them everything
	for nearly a quarter of anhour he spoke into the rapt silence he told them about hearing thedisembodied voice, how hermione had finally realized that he washearing a basilisk in the pipes how he and ron had followed thespiders into the forest, that aragog had told them where the lastvictim of the basilisk had died how he had guessed that moaningmyrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the chamber ofsecrets might be in her bathroom
	very well, professor mcgonagall prompted him as he paused, soyou found out where the entrance was  breaking a hundred schoolrules into pieces along the way, i might add  but how on earth didyou all get out of there alive, potterso harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, toldthem about fawkes's timely arrival and about the sorting hat givinghim the sword
	but then he faltered
	he had so far avoidedmentioning riddle's diary  or ginny
	she was standing with herhead against mrs
	weasley's shoulder, and tears were still coursingsilently down her cheeks
	what if they expelled her harry thought inpanic
	riddle's diary didn't work anymore
	how could they proveit had been he who'd made her do it allinstinctively, harry looked at dumbledore, who smiled faintly, thefirelight glancing off his halfmoon spectacles
	what interests me most, said dumbledore gently, is how lordvoldemort managed to enchant ginny, when my sources tell me he iscurrently in hiding in the forests of albania
	relief  warm, sweeping, glorious relief  swept over harry
	wwhat's that said mr
	weasley in a stunned voice
	youknowwhoenenchant ginny but ginny's not
	has sheit was this diary, said harry quickly, picking it up and showing it todumbledore
	riddle wrote it when he was sixteen
	dumbledore took the diary from harry and peered keenly down hislong, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages
	brilliant, he said softly
	of course, he was probably the mostbrilliant student hogwarts has ever seen
	he turned around to theweasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered
	very few people know that lord voldemort was once called tomriddle
	i taught him myself, fifty years ago, at hogwarts
	hedisappeared after leaving the school
	traveled far and wide
	sankso deeply into the dark arts, consorted with the very worst of ourkind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, thatwhen he resurfaced as lord voldemort, he was barely recognizable
	hardly anyone connected lord voldemort with the clever,handsome boy who was once head boy here
	what's our ginny got to do with with  himhis ddiaryl ginny sobbed
	i've bbeen writing in it, and he's beenwwriting back all year tinny said mr
	weasley, flabbergasted
	haven't i taught youanything
	what have i always told you never trust anything that canthink for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain  why didn'tyou show the diary to me, or your mother a suspicious object likethat, it was clearly full of dark magic'i ddidn't know, sobbed ginny
	i found it inside one of the booksmum got me
	i ththought someone had just left it in there andforgotten about it miss weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice
	this has been a terribleordeal for her
	there will be no punishment
	older and wiser wizardsthan she have been hoodwinked by lord voldemort
	he strode overto the door and opened it
	bed rest and perhaps a large, steamingmug of hot chocolate
	i always find that cheers me up, he added,twinkling kindly down at her
	you will find that madam pomfrey isstill awake
	she's just giving out mandrake juice  i daresay thebasilisk's victims will be waking up any moment
	so hermione's okay said ron brightly
	there has been no lasting harm done, ginny, said dumbledore
	weasley led ginny out, and mr
	weasley followed, still lookingdeeply shaken
	you know, minerva, professor dumbledore said thoughtfully toprofessor mcgonagall, i think all this merits a good feast
	might i askyou to go and alert the kitchensright, said professor mcgonagall crisply, also moving to the door
	i'll leave you to deal with potter and weasley, shall icertainly, said dumbledore
	she left, and harry and ron gazed uncertainly at dumbledore
	whatexactly had professor mcgonagall meant, deal with them surely surely  they weren't about to be punishedi seem to remember telling you both that i would have to expel you ifyou broke any more school rules, said dumbledore
	ron opened his mouth in horror
	which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat ourwords, dumbledore went on, smiling
	you will both receive specialawards for services to the school and  let me see  yes, i think twohundred points apiece for gryffindor
	ron went as briglitly pink as lockhart's valentine flowers and closedhis mouth again
	but one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in thisdangerous adventure, dumbledore added
	why so modest,gilderoyharry gave a start
	he had completely forgotten about lockhart
	heturned and saw that lockhart was standing in a corner of the room,still wearing his vague smile
	when dumbledore addressed him,lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to
	professor dumbledore, ron said quickly, there was an accidentdown in the chamber of secrets
	professor lockhart am i a professor said lockhart in mild surprise
	iexpect i was hopeless, was ihe tried to do a memory charm and the wand backfired, ronexplained quietly to dumbledore
	dear me, said dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silvermustache quivering
	impaled upon your own sword, gilderoysword said lockhart dimly
	would you mind taking professor lockhart up to the infirmary, toodumbledore said to ron
	id like a few more words with harry
	ron cast a curious look back at dumbledore andharry as he closed the door
	dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire
	sit down, harry, he said, and harry sat, feeling unaccountablynervous
	first of all, harry, i want to thank you, said dumbledore, eyestwinkling again
	you must have shown me real loyalty down in thechamber
	nothing but that could have called fawkes to you
	he stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his knee
	harry grinned awkwardly as dumbledore watched him
	and so you met tom riddle, said dumbledore thoughtfully
	iimagine he was most interested in you
	suddenly, something that was nagging at harry came tumbling out ofhis mouth
	professor dumbledore
	riddle said i'm like him
	strange likenesses,he said
	did he, now said dumbledore, looking thoughtfully at harry fromunder his thick silver eyebrows
	and what do you think, harryi don't think i'm like him said harry, more loudly than he'd intended
	i mean, i'm  i'm in gryffindor, i'm
	but he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind
	professor, he started again after a moment
	the sorting hat told meid  id have done well in slytherin
	everyone thought i was slytherin'sheir for a while
	because i can speak parseltongue
	you can speak parseltongue, harry, said dumbledore calmly,because lord voldemort  who is the last remaining ancestor32of salazar slytherin  can speak parseltongue
	unless i'm muchmistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to you the night hegave you that scar
	not something he intended to do, i'm sure
	voldemort put a bit of himself in me harry said, thunderstruck
	it certainly seems so
	so i should be in slytherin, harry said, looking desperately intodumbledore's face
	the sorting hat could see slytherin's power inme, and it put you in gryffindor, said dumbledore calmly
	you happen to have many qualities salazar slytherin prized in his handpicked students
	his own very rare gift, parseltongue resourcefulness  determination  a certain disregard for rules, headded, his mustache quivering again
	yet the sorting hat placed youin gryffindor
	you know why that was
	it only put me in gryffindor, said harry in a defeated voice, becausei asked not to go in slytherin
	exactly, said dumbledore, beaming once more
	which makes youvery different from tom riddle
	it is our choices, harry, that show whatwe truly are, far more than our abilities
	harry sat motionless in hischair, stunned
	if you want proof, harry, that you belong ingryffindor, i suggest you look more closely at this
	dumbledore reached across to professor mcgonagall's desk, pickedup the bloodstained silver sword, and handed it to harry
	dully, harryturned it over, the rubies blazing in the firelight
	and then he saw thename engraved just below the hilt
	godric gryffindoronly a true gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, harry,said dumbledore simply
	for a minute, neither of them spoke
	then dumbledore pulled openone of the drawers in professor mcgonagall's desk and took out a quilland a bottle of ink
	what you need, harry, is some food and sleep
	i suggest you go downto the feast, while i write to azkaban  we need our gamekeeperback
	and i must draft an advertisement for the daily prophet, too, headded thoughtfully
	we'll be needing a new defense against thedark arts teacher
	dear me, we do seem to run through them, don'tweharry got up and crossed to the door
	he had just reached for thehandle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it bouncedback off the wall
	lucius malfoy stood there, fury in his face
	and cowering behind hislegs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was dobby
	good evening, lucius, said dumbledore pleasantly
	malfoy almost knocked harry over as he swept into the room
	dobby went scurrying in after him, crouching at the hem of his cloak,a look of abject terror on his face
	the elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting tofinish cleaning mr
	malfoy had set outin a great hurry, for not only were his shoes halfpolished, but hisusually sleek hair was disheveled
	ignoring the elf bobbingapologetically around his ankles, he fixed his cold eyes upondumbledore
	so he said you've come back
	the governors suspended you, butyou still saw fit to return to hogwarts
	well, you see, lucius, said dumbledore, smiling serenely, theother eleven governors contacted me today
	it was something likebeing caught in a hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth
	they'd heard thatarthur weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back hereat once
	they seemed to think i was the best man for the job afterall
	very strange tales they told me, too
	several of them seemedto think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn'tagree to suspend me in the first place
	malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still slits offury
	so  have you stopped the attacks yet he sneered
	have youcaught the culpritwe have, said dumbledore, with a smile
	who is itthe same person as last time, lucius, said dumbledore
	but thistime, lord voldemort was acting through somebody else
	by meansof this diary
	he held up the small black book with the large hole through thecenter, watching mr
	harry, however, was watchingdobby
	the elf was doing something very odd
	his great eyes fixedmeaningfully on harry, he kept pointing at the diary, then at mr
	malfoy, and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist
	malfoy slowly to dumbledore
	a clever plan, said dumbledore in a level voice, still staring mr
	malfoy straight in the eye
	because if harry here mr
	malfoy shotharry a swift, sharp look  and his friend ron hadn't discoveredthis book, why  ginny weasley might have taken allthe blame
	no one would ever have been able to prove she hadn'tacted of her own free will
	his face was suddenly masklike
	and imagine, dumbledore went on, what might have happenedthen
	the weasleys are one of our most prominent purebloodfamilies
	imagine the effect on arthur weasley and his muggleprotection act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and killing muggleborns
	very fortunate the diary was discovered,and riddle's memories wiped from it
	who knows what theconsequences might have been otherwise
	malfoy forced himself to speak
	very fortunate, he said stiffly
	and still, behind his back, dobby was pointing, first to the diary,then to lucius malfoy, then punching himself in the head
	and harry suddenly understood
	he nodded at dobby, and dobbybacked into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment
	don't you want to know how ginny got hold of that diary, mr
	lucius malfoy rounded on him
	how should i know how the stupid little girl got hold of it he said
	because you gave it to her, said harry
	in flourish and blotts
	you picked up her old transfiguration book and slipped the diaryinside it, didn't youhe saw mr
	malfoy's white hands clench and unclench
	oh, no one will be able to do that, said dumbledore, smiling atharry
	not now that riddle has vanished from the book
	onthe other hand, i would advise you, lucius, not to go giving out anymore of lord voldemort's old school things
	if any more of them findtheir way into innocent hands, i think arthur weasley, for one, willmake sure they are traced back to you
	lucius malfoy stood for a moment, and harry distinctly saw his righthand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand
	instead,he turned to his houseelfwe're going, dobbyhe wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him,he kicked him right through it
	they could hear dobby squealing withpain all the way along the corridor
	harry stood for a moment,thinking hard
	then it came to him professor dumbledore, he said hurriedly
	can i give that diaryback to mr
	malfoy, pleasecertainly, harry, said dumbledore calmly
	harry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office
	he could heardobby's squeals of pain receding around the corner
	quickly,wondering if this plan could possibly work, harry took off one of hisshoes, pulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into it
	then he ran down the dark corridor
	he caught up with them at the top of the stairs
	malfoy, he gasped, skidding to a halt, i've got something foryou and he forced the smelly sock into lucius malfoy's hand
	malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then lookedfuriously from the ruined book to harry
	you'll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days,harry potter, he said softly
	they were meddlesome fools, too
	but dobby didn't move
	he was holding up harry's disgusting, slimysock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure
	master has given a sock, said the elf in wonderment
	master gaveit to dobby
	what did you saygot a sock, said dobby in disbelief
	master threw it, and dobbycaught it, and dobby  dobby is free
	lucius malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf then he lunged atharry
	you've lost me my servant, boybut dobby shouted, you shall not harm harry potterthere was a loud bang, and mr
	malfoy was thrown backward
	hecrashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heapon the landing below
	he got up, his face livid, and pulled out hiswand, but dobby raised a long, threatening finger
	you shall go now, he said fiercely, pointing down at mr
	you shall not touch harry potter
	lucius malfoy had no choice
	with a last, incensed stare at the pairof them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight
	harry potter freed dobby said the elf shrilly, gazing up at harry,moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orblike eyes
	harry potter set dobby freeleast i could do, dobby, said harry, grinning
	just promise neverto try and save my life again
	the elf's ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile
	i've just got one question, dobby, said harry as dobby pulled onharry's sock with shaking hands
	you told me all this had nothing todo with hewhomustnotbenamed, remember well it was a clue, sir, said dobby, his eyes widening, as though this wasobvious
	was giving you a clue
	the dark lord, before he changedhis name, could be freely named, you seeright, said harry weakly
	there's a feast, andmy friend hermione should be awake by now
	dobby threw his arms around harry's middle and hugged him
	harry potter is greater by far than dobby knew he sobbed
	farewell, harry potterand with a final loud crack, dobby disappeared
	harry had been to several hogwarts feasts, but never one quite likethis
	everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted allnight
	harry didn't know whether the best bit was hermione runningtoward him, screaming you solved it you solved it or justinhurrying over from the hufflepuff table to wring
	his hand andapologize endlessly for suspecting him, or hagrid turning up at halfpast three, cuffing harry and ron so hard on the shoulders that theywere knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and ron's four hundredpoints for gryffindor securing the house cup for the second yearrunning, or professor mcgonagall standing up totell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat oh,no said hermione, or dumbledore announcing that, unfortunately,professor lockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to thefact that he needed to go away and get his memory back
	quite a fewof the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news
	shame, said ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut
	he wasstarting to grow on me
	the rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine
	hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences defense against the dark arts classes were canceled but we'vehad plenty of practice at that anyway, ron told a disgruntledhermione and lucius malfoy had been sacked as a school governor
	draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he ownedthe place
	on the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky
	on the otherhand, ginny weasley was perfectly happy again
	too soon, it was time for the journey home on the hogwarts express
	harry, ron, hermione, fred, george, and ginny got a compartment tothemselves
	they made the most of the last few hours in which theywere allowed to do magic before the holidays
	they played explodingsnap, set off the very last of fred and george's filibuster fireworks,and practiced disarming each other by magic
	harry was getting verygood at it
	they were almost at king's cross when harry rememberedsomething
	ginny  what did you see percy doing, that he didn't want you to tellanyoneoh, that, said ginny, giggling
	well  percy's got a girlfriend
	freddropped a stack of books on george's head
	whatit's that ravenclaw prefect, penelope clearwater, said ginny
	that's who he was writing to all last summer
	he's been meeting herall over the school in secret
	i walked in on them kissing in an emptyclassroom one day
	he was so upset when she was  you know attacked
	you won't tease him, will you she added anxiously
	wouldn't dream of it, said fred, who was looking like his birthdayhad come early
	definitely not, said george, sniggering
	the hogwarts express slowed and finally stopped
	harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to ronand hermione
	this is called a telephone number, he told ron, scribbling it twice,tearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them
	i told your dadhow to use a telephone last summer  he'll know
	call me at thedursleys', okay i can't stand another two months with only dudleyto talk to
	your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won't they saidhermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd throngingtoward the enchanted barrier
	when they hear what you did thisyearproud said harry
	are you crazy all those times i could'vedied, and i didn't manage it they'll be furious
	and together they walked back through the gateway to the muggleworld
	'harry potter and the prisoner of azkabanby j
	rowlingchapter oneowl postharry potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways
	for one thing, hehated the summer holidays more than any other time of year
	for another,he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret,in the dead of night
	and he also happened to be a wizard
	it was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, theblankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one handand a large leatherbound book a history of magic by bathilda bagshotpropped open against the pillow
	harry moved the tip of hiseaglefeather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for somethingthat would help him write his essay, witch burning in the fourteenthcentury was completely pointless discuss
	the quill paused at the top of a likelylooking paragraph
	harry pushedhis round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closerto the book, and readnonmagic people more commonly known as muggles were particularlyafraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it
	on the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burninghad no effect whatsoever
	the witch or wizard would perform a basicflame freezing charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoyinga gentle, tickling sensation
	indeed, wendelin the weird enjoyed beingburned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less thanfortyseven times in various disguises
	harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillowfor his ink bottle and a roll of parchment
	slowly and very carefully heunscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to write,pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the dursleysheard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he'dprobably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for therest of the summer
	the dursley family of number four, privet drive, was the reason thatharry never enjoyed his summer holidays
	uncle vernon, aunt petunia, andtheir son, dudley, were harry's only living relatives
	they weremuggles, and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic
	harry'sdead parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were nevermentioned under the dursleys' roof for years, aunt petunia and unclevernon had hoped that if they kept harry as downtrodden as possible,they would be able to squash the magic out of him
	to their fury, theyhad been unsuccessful
	these days they lived in terror of anyone findingout that harry had spent most of the last two years at hogwarts schoolof witchcraft and wizardry
	the most they could do, however, was to lockaway harry's spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and broomstick at the start ofthe summer break, and forbid him to talk to the neighbors
	this separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for harry,because his teachers at hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work
	one of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, wasfor harry's least favorite teacher, professor snape, who would bedelighted to have an excuse to give harry detention for a month
	harryhad therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays
	whileuncle vernon, aunt petunia, and dudley had gone out into the frontgarden to admire uncle vernon's new company car in very loud voices, sothat the rest of the street would notice it too, harry had creptdownstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbedsome of his books, and hidden them in his bedroom
	as long as he didn'tleave spots of ink on the sheets, the dursleys need never know that hewas studying magic by night
	harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle atthe moment, as they were already in an especially bad mood with him, allbecause he'd received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one weekinto the school vacation
	ron weasley, who was one of harry's best friends at hogwarts, came froma whole family of wizards
	this meant that he knew a lot of things harrydidn't, but had never used a telephone before
	most unluckily, it hadbeen uncle vernon who had answered the call
	vernon dursley speaking
	harry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he heardron's voice answer
	hello hello can you hear me i  want  to  talk  to  harry potterron was yelling so loudly that uncle vernon jumped and held the receivera foot away from his ear, staring at it with an expression of mingledfury and alarm
	who is this he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece
	who areyouron  weasley ron bellowed back, as though he and uncle vernon werespeaking from opposite ends of a football field
	i'm  a  friend of  harry's  from  school uncle vernon's small eyes swiveled around to harry, who was rooted tothe spot
	there is no harry potter here he roared, now holding the receiver atarm's length, as though frightened it might explode
	i don't know whatschool youre talking about never contact me again don't you come nearmy familyand he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping apoisonous spider
	the fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever
	how dare you give this number to people like  people like you unclevernon had roared, spraying harry with spit
	ron obviously realized that he'd gotten harry into trouble, because hehadn't called again
	harry's other best friend from hogwarts, hermionegranger, hadn't been in touch either
	harry suspected that ron hadwarned hermione not to call, which was a pity, because hermione, thecleverest witch in harry's year, had muggle parents, knew perfectly wellhow to use a telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not tosay that she went to hogwarts
	so harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five longweeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the lastone
	there was just one very small improvement  after swearing that hewouldn't use her to send letters to any of his friends, harry had beenallowed to let his owl, hedwig, out at night
	uncle vernon had given inbecause of the racket hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all thetime
	harry finished writing about wendelin the weird and paused to listenagain
	the silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant,grunting snores of his enormous cousin, dudley
	it must be very late,harry thought
	his eyes were itching with tiredness
	perhaps he'd finishthis essay tomorrow night
	he replaced the top of the ink bottle pulled an old pillowcase fromunder his bed put the flashlight, a history of magic, his essay, quill,and ink inside it got out of bed and hid the lot under a loosefloorboard under his bed
	then he stood up, stretched, and checked thetime on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table
	it was one o'clock in the morning
	harry's stomach gave a funny jolt
	hehad been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a whole hour
	yet another unusual thing about harry was how little he looked forwardto his birthdays
	he had never received a birthday card in his life
	thedursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays, and he had noreason to suppose they would remember this one
	harry walked across the dark room, past hedwig's large, empty cage, tothe open window
	he leaned on the sill, the cool night air pleasant onhis face after a long time under the blankets
	hedwig had been absentfor two nights now
	harry wasn't worried about her she'd been gone thislong before
	but he hoped she'd be back soon  she was the only livingcreature in this house who didn't flinch at the sight of him
	harry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had grown a fewinches over the last year
	his jetblack hair, however, was just as italways had been  stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it
	the eyesbehind his glasses were bright green, and on his forehead, clearlyvisible through his hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt oflightning
	of all the unusual things about harry, this scar was the mostextraordinary of all
	it was not, as the dursleys had pretended for tenyears, a souvenir of the car crash that had killed harry's parents,because lily and james potter had not died in a car crash
	they had beenmurdered, murdered by the most feared dark wizard for a hundred years,lord voldemort
	harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing morethan a scar on his forehead, where voldemort's curse, instead of killinghim, had rebounded upon its originator
	barely alive, voldemort hadfled
	but harry had come facetoface with him at hogwarts
	remembering theirlast meeting as he stood at the dark window, harry had to admit he waslucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday
	he scanned the starry sky for a sign of hedwig, perhaps soaringback to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak, expecting praise
	gazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before harryrealized what he was seeing
	silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every moment,was a large, strangely lopsided creature, and it was flapping in harry'sdirection
	he stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower
	for asplit second he hesitated, his hand on the window latch, wonderingwhether to slam it shut
	but then the bizarre creature soared over oneof the street lamps of privet drive, and harry, realizing what it was,leapt aside
	through the window soared three owls, two of them holding up the third,which appeared to be unconscious
	they landed with a soft flump onharry's bed, and the middle owl, which was large and gray, keeled rightover and lay motionless
	there was a large package tied to its legs
	harry recognized the unconscious owl at once  his name was errol, andhe belonged to the weasley family
	harry dashed to the bed, untied thecords around errol's legs, took off the parcel, and then carried errolto hedwig's cage
	errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot ofthanks, and began to gulp some water
	harry turned back to the remaining owls
	one of them, the large snowyfemale, was his own hedwig
	she, too, was carrying a parcel and lookedextremely pleased with herself
	she gave harry an affectionate nip withher beak as he removed her burden, then flew across the room to joinerrol
	harry didn't recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but he knewat once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package,it was carrying a letter bearing the hogwarts crest
	when harry relievedthis owl of its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretchedits wings, and took off through the window into the night
	harry sat down on his bed and grabbed errol's package, ripped off thebrown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and his firstever birthday card
	fingers trembling slightly, he opened the envelope
	two pieces of paper fell out  a letter and a newspaper clipping
	the clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper, the dailyprophet, because the people in the blackandwhite picture were moving
	harry picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and readministry of magic employee scoops grand prizearthur weasley, head of the misuse of muggle artifacts office at theministry of magic, has won the annual daily prophet grand prize galleondraw
	weasley told the daily prophet, we will be spending thegold on a summer holiday in egypt, where our eldest son, bill, works asa curse breaker for gringotts wizarding bank
	the weasley family will be spending a month in egypt, returning for thestart of the new school year at hogwarts, which five of the weasleychildren currently attend
	harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across his faceas he saw all nine of the weasleys waving furiously at him, standing infront of a large pyramid
	weasley tail, balding mr
	weasley six sons and one daughter, all though the blackandwhitepicture didn't show it with flamingred hair
	right in the middle ofthe picture was ron, tall and gangling, with his pet rat, scabbers, onhis shoulder and his arm around his little sister, ginny
	harry couldn't think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of goldmore than the weasleys, who were very nice and extremely poor
	he pickedup ron's letter and unfolded it
	dear harry,happy birthdaylook, i' really sorry about that telephone call
	i hope the mugglesdidn't give you a hard time
	i asked dad, and he reckons i shouldn'thave shouted
	it's amazing here in egypt
	bill's taken us around all the tombs and youwouldn't believe the curses those old egyptian wizards put on them
	mumwouldn't let ginny come in the last one
	there were all these mutantskeletons in there, of muggles who'd broken in and grown extra heads andstuff
	i couldn't believe it when dad won the daily prophet draw
	seven hundredgalleons most of it's gone on this trip, but they're going to buy me anew wand for next year
	harry remembered only too well the occasion when ron's old wand hadsnapped
	it had happened when the car the two of them had been flying tohogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds
	we'll be back about a week before term starts and we'll be going up tolondon to get my wand and our new books
	any chance of meeting youtheredon't let the muggles get you downtry and come to london,ronp
	he got the letter last week
	harry glanced back at the photograph
	percy, who was in his seventh andfinal year at hogwarts, was looking particularly smug
	he had pinned hishead boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair, hishornrimmed glasses flashing in the egyptian sun
	harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it
	inside was what lookedlike a miniature glass spinning top
	there was another note from ronbeneath it
	harry  this is a pocket sneakoscope
	if there's someone untrustworthyaround, it's supposed to light up and spin
	bill says it's rubbish soldfor wizard tourists and isn't reliable, because it kept lighting up atdinner last night
	but he didn't realize fred and george had put beetlesin his soup
	bye ronharry put the pocket sneakoscope on his bedside table, where it stoodquite still, balanced on its point, reflecting the luminous hands of hisclock
	he looked at it happily for a few seconds, then picked up theparcel hedwig had brought
	inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, and a letter,this time from hermione
	dear harry,ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your uncle vernon
	ido hope you're all right
	i'm on holiday in france at the moment and i didn't know how i was goingto send this to you  what if they'd opened it at customs  but thenhedwig turned up i think she wanted to make sure you got something foryour birthday for a change
	i bought your present by owlorder therewas an advertisement in the daily prophet i've been getting itdelivered it's so good to keep up with what's going on in the wizardingworld, did you see that picture of ron and his family a week ago i bethe's learning loads
	i'm really jealous  the ancient egyptian wizardswere fascinating
	there's some interesting local history of witchcraft here, too
	i'verewritten my whole history of magic essay to include some of the thingsi've found out, i hope it's not too long  it's two rolls of parchmentmore than professor binns asked for
	ron says he's going to be in london in the last week of the holidays
	can you make it will your aunt and uncle let you come i really hopeyou can
	if not, i'll see you on the hogwarts express on septemberfirstlove from hermionep
	ron says percy's head boy
	i'll bet percy's really pleased rondoesn't seem too happy about itharry laughed as he put herrmone's letter aside and picked up herpresent
	knowing hermione, he was sure it would be alarge book full of very difficult spells  but it wasn't
	his heartgave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek blackleather case, with silver words stamped across it, reading broomstickservicing kit
	wow, hermione harry whispered, unzipping the case to look inside
	there was a large jar of fleetwood's highfinish handle polish, a pairof gleaming silver talltwig clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip onyour broom for long journeys, and a handbook of doityourselfbroomcare
	apart from his friends, the thing that harry missed most about hogwartswas quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world  highlydangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks
	harry happened tobe a very good quidditch player he had been the youngest person in acentury to be picked for one of the hogwarts house teams
	one of harry'smost prized possessions was his nimbus two thousand racing broom
	harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel
	herecognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once this was fromhagrid, the hogwarts gamekeeper
	he tore off the top layer of paper andglimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap itproperly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside itsnapped loudly  as though it had jaws
	he knew that hagrid would never send him anything dangerouson purpose, but then, hagrid didn't have a normal person's view of whatwas dangerous
	hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buyvicious, threeheaded dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragoneggs into his cabin
	harry poked the parcel nervously
	it snapped loudly again
	harry reachedfor the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, andraised it over his head, ready to strike
	then he seized the rest of thewrapping paper in his other hand and pulled
	harry just had time to register its handsomegreen cover, emblazoned with the golden title the monster book ofmonsters, before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways alongthe bed like some weird crab
	the book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidlyacross the room
	harry followed it stealthily
	the book was hiding inthe dark space under his desk
	praying that the dursleys were still fastasleep, harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it
	ouchthe book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him, stillscuttling on its covers
	harry scrambled around, threw himself forward,and managed to flatten it
	uncle vernon gave a loud, sleepy grunt in theroom next door
	hedwig and errol watched interestedly as harry clamped the strugglingbook tightly in his arms, hurried to his chest of drawers, and pulledout a belt, which he buckled tightly around it
	the monster bookshuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, so harry threw itdown on the bed and reached for hagrid's card
	dear harry,happy birthdaythink you might find this useful for next year
	won't say no more here
	tell you when i see you
	hope the muggles are treating you right
	all the best,hagridit struck harry as ominous that hagrid thought a biting book would comein useful, but he put hagrid's card up next to ron's and hermione's,grinning more broadly than ever
	now there was only the letter fromhogwarts left
	noticing that it was rather thicker than usual, harry slit open theenvelope, pulled out the first page of parchment within, and readdear mr
	potter,please note that the new school year will begin on september the first
	the hogwarts express will leave ftom king's cross station, platform nineand threequarters, at eleven o'clock
	third years are permitted to visit the village of hogsmeade on certainweekends
	please give the enclosed permission form to your parent orguardian to sign
	a list of books for next year is enclosed
	yours sincerely,professor m
	mcgonagalldeputy headmistressharry pulled out the hogsmeade permission form and looked at it, nolonger grinning
	it would be wonderful to visit hogsmeade on weekendshe knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he had never set footthere
	but how on earth was he going to persuade uncle vernon or auntpetunia to sign the formhe looked over at the alarm clock
	it was now two o'clock in themorning
	deciding that he'd worry about the hogsmeade form when he woke up, harrygot back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the charthe'd made for himself, counting down the days left until his return tohogwarts
	then he took off his glasses and lay down, eyes open, facinghis three birthday cards
	extremely unusual though he was, at that moment harry potter felt justlike everyone else  glad, for the first time in his life, that it washis birthday
	chapter twoaunt marge's big mistakeharry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three dursleysalready sitting around the kitchen table
	they were watching a brandnewtelevision, a welcomehomeforthesummer present for dudley, who hadbeen complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and thetelevision in the living room
	dudley had spent most of the summer inthe kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his fivechins wobbling as he ate continually
	harry sat down between dudley and uncle vernon, a large, beefy man withvery little neck and a lot of mustache
	far from wishing harry a happybirthday, none of the dursleys made any sign that they had noticed harryenter the room, but harry was far too used to this to care
	he helpedhimself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on thetelevision, who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict
	the public is warned that black is armed and extremely dangerous
	aspecial hot line has been set up, and any sighting of black should bereported immediately
	no need to tell us he's no good, snorted uncle vernon, staring overthe top of his newspaper at the prisoner
	look at the state of him, thefilthy layabout look at his hairhe shot a nasty look sideways at harry, whose untidy hair had alwaysbeen a source of great annoyance to uncle vernon
	compared to the man onthe television, however, whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted,elbowlength tangle, harry felt very well groomed indeed
	the reporter had reappeared
	the ministry of agriculture and fisheries will announce today hang on barked uncle vernon, staring furiously at the reporter
	youdidn't tell us where that maniac's escaped from what use is thatlunatic could be coming up the street right nowaunt petunia, who was bony and horsefaced, whipped around and peeredintently out of the kitchen window
	harry knew aunt petunia would simplylove to be the one to call the hot line number
	she was the nosiestwoman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring,lawabiding neighbors
	when will they learn, said uncle vernon, pounding the table with hislarge purple fist, that hanging's the only way to deal with thesepeoplevery true, said aunt petunia, who was still squinting into next door'srunner beans
	uncle vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his watch, and added, i'dbetter be off in a minute, petunia
	marge's train gets in at ten
	harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the broomstick servicingkit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump
	aunt marge he blurted out
	sh  she's not coming here, is sheaunt marge was uncle vernon's sister
	even though she was not a bloodrelative of harry's whose mother had been aunt petunia's sister, hehad been forced to call her aunt all his life
	aunt marge lived in thecountry, in a house with a large garden, where she bred bulldogs
	shedidn't often stay at privet drive, because she couldn't bear to leaveher precious dogs, but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly inharry's mind
	at dudley's fifth birthday party, aunt margo had whacked harry aroundthe shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating dudley atmusical statues
	a few years later, she had turned up at christmas witha computerized robot for dudley and a box of dog biscuits for harry
	onher last visit, the year before harry started at hogwarts, harry hadaccidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog
	ripper had chasedharry out into the garden and up a tree, and aunt marge had refused tocall him off until past midnight
	the memory of this incident stillbrought tears of laughter to dudley's eyes
	marge'll be here for a week, uncle vernon snarled, 11 and while we'reon the subject  he pointed a fat finger threateningly at harry  weneed to get a few things straight before i go and collect her
	dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television
	watching harrybeing bullied by uncle vernon was dudley's favorite form ofentertainment
	firstly, growled uncle vernon, you'll keep a civil tongue in yourhead when you're talking to marge
	all right, said harry bitterly, if she does when she's talking to me
	secondly, said uncle vernon, acting as though he had not heard harry'sreply, as marge doesn't know anything about your abnormality, i don'twant any  any funny stuff while she's here
	you behave yourself, got mei will if she does, said harry through gritted teeth
	and thirdly, said uncle vernon, his mean little eyes now slits in hisgreat purple face, we've told marge you attend st
	brutus's securecenter for incurably criminal boys
	and you'll be sticking to that story, boy, or there'll be trouble, spatuncle vernon
	harry sat there, whitefaced and furious, staring at uncle vernon,hardly able to believe it
	aunt marge coming for a weeklong visit  itwas the worst birthday present the dursleys had ever given him,including that pair of uncle vernon's old socks
	well, petunia, said uncle vernon, getting heavily to his feet, i'llbe off to the station, then
	want to come along for the ride, duddersno, said dudley, whose attention had returned to the television nowthat uncle vernon had finished threatening harry
	duddy's got to make himself smart for his auntie, said aunt petunia,smoothing dudley's thick blond hair
	mummy's bought him a lovely newbow tie
	uncle vernon clapped dudley on his porky shoulder
	see you in a bit,then, he said, and he left the kitchen
	harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a suddenidea
	abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and followeduncle vernon to the front door
	uncle vernon was pulling on his car coat
	i'm not taking you, he snarled as he turned to see harry watching him
	like i wanted to come, said harry coldly
	i want to ask yousomething
	uncle vernon eyed him suspiciously
	third years at hog  at my school are allowed to visit the villagesometimes, said harry
	so snapped uncle vernon, taking his car keys from a hook next to thedoor
	i need you to sign the permission form, said harry in a rush
	and why should i do that sneered uncle vernon
	well, said harry, choosing his words carefully, it'll be hard work,pretending to aunt marge i go to that st
	brutus's secure center for incurably criminal boys bellowed unclevernon, and harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in unclevernon's voice
	exactly, said harry, looking calmly up into uncle vernon's large,purple face
	it's a lot to remember
	i'll have to make it soundconvincing, won't i what if i accidentally let something slipyou'll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won't you roared unclevernon, advancing on harry with his fist raised
	but harry stood hisground
	knocking the stuffing out of me won't make aunt marge forget what icould tell her, he said grimly
	uncle vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an ugly puce
	but if you sign my permission form, harry went on quickly, i sweari'll remember where i'm supposed to go to school, and i'll act like amug  like i'm normal and everything
	harry could tell that uncle vernon was thinking it over, even if histeeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple
	right, he snapped finally
	i shall monitor your behavior carefullyduring marge's visit
	if, at the end of it, you've toed the line andkept to the story, i'll sign your ruddy form
	he wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it so hardthat one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out
	harry didn't return to the kitchen
	he went back upstairs to hisbedroom
	if he was going to act like a real muggle, he'd better startnow
	slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthdaycards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework
	then hewent to hedwig's cage
	errol seemed to have recovered he and hedwigwere both asleep, heads under their wings
	harry sighed, then poked themboth awake
	hedwig, he said gloomily, you're going to have to clear off for aweek
	ron'll look after you
	i'll write him a note,explaining
	and don't look at me like that  hedwig's large amber eyeswere reproachful  it's not my fault
	it's the only way i'll beallowed to visit hogsmeade with ron and hermione
	ten minutes later, errol and hedwig who had a note to ron bound to herleg soared out of the window and out of sight
	harry, now feelingthoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe
	but harry didn't have long to brood
	in next to no time, aunt petuniawas shrieking up the stairs for harry to come down and get ready towelcome their guest
	do something about your hair aunt petunia snapped as he reached thehall
	harry couldn't see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat
	auntmarge loved criticizing him, so the untidier he looked, the happier shewould be
	all too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as uncle vernon's carpulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the car doors andfootsteps on the garden path
	get the door aunt petunia hissed at harry
	a feeling of great gloom in his stomach, harry pulled the door open
	on the threshold stood aunt marge
	she was very like uncle vernonlarge, beefy, and purple faced, she even had a mustache, though not asbushy as his
	in one hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tuckedunder the other was an old and eviltempered bulldog
	where's my dudders roared aunt marge
	where's my neffypoodudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair plastered flat to hisfat head, a bow tie just visible under his many chins
	aunt marge thrustthe suitcase into harry's stomach, knocking the wind out of him, seizeddudley in a tight onearmed hug, and planted a large kiss on his cheek
	harry knew perfectly well that dudley only put up with aunt marge's hugsbecause he was well paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart,dudley had a crisp twentypound note clutched in his fat fist
	petunia shouted aunt marge, striding past harry as though he was ahat stand
	aunt marge and aunt petunia kissed, or rather, aunt margebumped her large jaw against aunt petunia's bony cheekbone
	uncle vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door
	and what will ripper takeripper can have some tea out of my saucer, said aunt marge as they allproceeded into the kitchen, leaving harry alone in the hall with thesuitcase
	but harry wasn't complaining any excuse not to be with auntmarge was fine by him, so he began to heave the case upstairs into thespare bedroom, taking as long as he could
	by the time he got back to the kitchen, aunt marge had been suppliedwith tea and fruitcake, and ripper was lapping noisily in the corner
	harry saw aunt petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool fleckedher clean floor
	aunt petunia hated animals
	who's looking after the other dogs, marge uncle vernon asked
	oh, i've got colonel fubster managing them, boomed aunt marge
	he'sretired now, good for him to have something to do
	but i couldn't leavepoor old ripper
	he pines if he's away from me
	ripper began to growl again as harry sat down
	this directed auntmarge's attention to harry for the first time
	still here, are youyes, said harry
	don't you say yes' in that ungrateful tone, aunt marge growled
	it'sdamn good of vernon and petunia to keep you
	wouldn't have done itmyself
	you'd have gone straight to an orphanage if you'd been dumped onmy doorstep
	harry was bursting to say that he'd rather live in an orphanage thanwith the dursleys, but the thought of the hogsmeade form stopped him
	heforced his face into a painful smile
	don't you smirk at me boomed aunt marge
	i can see you haven'timproved since i last saw you
	i hoped school would knock some mannersinto you
	she took a large gulp of tea, wiped her mustache, and said,where is it that you send him, again, vernonst
	brutus's, said uncle vernon promptly
	it's a firstrateinstitution for hopeless cases
	i see, said aunt marge
	do they use the cane at st
	brutus's, boyshe barked across the table
	er uncle vernon nodded curtly behind aunt marge's back
	then, feeling he might as well do the thing properly,he added, all the time
	excellent, said aunt marge
	i won't have this nambypamby,wishywashy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it
	a goodthrashing is what's needed in ninetynine cases out of a hundred
	haveyou been beaten oftenoh, yeah, said harry, loads of times
	aunt marge narrowed her eyes
	i still don't like your tone, boy, she said
	if you can speak of yourbeatings in that casual way, they clearly aren't hitting you hardenough
	petunia, i'd write if i were you
	make it clear that you approvethe use of extreme force in this boy's case
	perhaps uncle vernon was worried that harry might forget their bargainin any case, he changed the subject abruptly
	heard the news this morning, marge what about that escaped prisoner,ehas aunt marge started to make herself at home, harry caught himselfthinking almost longingly of life at number four without her
	unclevernon and aunt petunia usually encouraged harry to stay out of theirway, which harry was only too happy to do
	aunt marge, on the otherhand, wanted harry under her eye at all times, so that she could boomout suggestions for his improvement
	she delighted in comparing harrywith dudley, and took huge pleasure in buying dudley expensive presentswhile glaring at harry, as though daring him to ask why he hadn't got apresent too
	she also kept throwing out dark hints about what made harrysuch an unsatisfactory person
	you mustn't blame yourself for the way the boy's turned out, vernon,she said over lunch on the third day
	if there's something rotten onthe inside, there's nothing anyone can do about it
	harry tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands shook and his facewas starting to burn with anger
	remember the form, he told himselfthink about hogsmeade
	don't riseaunt marge reached for her glass of wine
	it's one of the basic rules of breeding, she said
	you see it all thetime with dogs
	if there's something wrong with the bitch, there'll besomething wrong with the pup at that moment, the wineglass aunt marge was holding exploded in herhand
	shards of glass flew in every direction and aunt marge sputteredand blinked, her great ruddy face dripping
	marge squealed aunt petunia
	marge, are you all rightnot to worry, grunted aunt marge, mopping her face with her napkin
	must have squeezed it too hard
	did the same thing at colonel fubster'sthe other day
	no need to fuss, petunia, i have a very firm grip
	but aunt petunia and uncle vernon were both looking at harrysuspiciously, so he decided he'd better skip dessert and escape from thetable as soon as he could
	outside in the hall, he leaned against the wall, breathing deeply it hadbeen a long time since he'd lost control and made something explode
	hecouldn't afford to let it happen again
	the hogsmeade form wasn't theonly thing at stake  if he carried on like that, he'd be in troublewith the ministry of magic
	harry was still an underage wizard, and he was forbidden by wizard lawto do magic outside school
	his record wasn't exactly clean either
	onlylast summer he'd gotten an official warning that had stated quiteclearly that if the ministry got wind of any more magic in privet drive,harry would face expulsion from hogwarts
	he heard the dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of theway
	harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think abouthis handbook of doityourself broomcare whenever aunt marge started onhim
	this worked quite well, though it seemed to give him a glazed look,because aunt marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentallysubnormal
	at last, at long last, the final evening of marge's stay arrived
	auntpetunia cooked a fancy dinner and uncle vernon uncorked several bottlesof wine
	they got all the way through the soup and the salmon without asingle mention of harry's faults during the lemon meringue pie, unclevernon bored them a with a long talk about grunnings, his drillmakingcompany then aunt petunia made coffee and uncle vernon brought out abottle of brandy
	can i tempt you, margeaunt marge had already had quite a lot of wine
	her huge face was veryred
	just a small one, then, she chuckled
	a bit more than that
	dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie
	aunt petunia was sippingcoffee with her little finger sticking out
	harry really wanted todisappear into his bedroom, but he met uncle vernon's angry little eyesand knew he would have to sit it out
	aah, said aunt marge, smacking her lips and putting the empty brandyglass back down
	excellent nosh, petunia
	it's normally just a fryupfor me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after
	she burpedrichly and patted her great tweed stomach
	but i do like tosee a healthysized boy, she went on, winking at dudley
	you'll be apropersized man, dudders, like your father
	yes, i'll have a spot morebrandy, vernon
	now, this one here she jerked her head at harry, who felt his stomach clench
	the handbook,he thought quickly
	this one's got a mean, runty look about him
	you get that with dogs
	ihad colonel fubster drown one last year
	ratty little thing it wasweak
	harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book a charm to curereluctant reversers
	it all comes down to blood, as i was saying theother day
	now, i'm saying nothing against your family,petunia she patted aunt petunia's bony hand with her shovellike onebut your sister was a bad egg
	they turn up in the best families
	thenshe ran off with a wastrel and here's the result right in front of us
	harry was staring at his plate, a funny ringing in his ears
	grasp yourbroom firmly by the tail, he thought
	but he couldn't remember what camenext
	aunt marge's voice seemed to be boring into him like one of unclevernon's drills
	this potter, 5 said aunt marge loudly, seizing the brandy bottle andsplashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth, you never toldme what he diduncle vernon and aunt petunia were looking extremely tense
	dudley hadeven looked up from his pie to gape at his parents
	he  didn't work, said uncle vernon, with half a glance at harry
	as i expected said aunt marge, taking a huge swig of brandy andwiping her chin on her sleeve
	a noaccount, goodfornothing, lazyscrounger who he was not, said harry suddenly
	the table went very quiet
	harry wasshaking all over
	he had never felt so angry in his life
	more brandy yelled uncle vernon, who had gone very white
	he emptiedthe bottle into aunt marge's glass
	you, boy, he snarled at harry
	goto bed, go on no, vernon, hiccuped aunt marge, holding up a hand, her tiny bloodshoteyes fixed on harry's
	proud of your parents, areyou they go and get themselves killed in a car crash drunk, i expect'they didn't die in a car crash said harry, who found himself on hisfeet
	they died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be aburden on their decent, hardworking relatives screamed aunt marge,swelling with fury
	you are an insolent, ungrateful little but aunt marge suddenly stopped speaking
	for a moment, it looked asthough words had failed her
	she seemed to be swelling withinexpressible anger  but the swelling didn't stop
	her great red facestarted to expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched tootightly for speech  next second, several buttons had just burst fromher tweed jacket and pinged off the walls  she was inflating like amonstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband,each of her fingers blowing up like a salami marge yelled uncle vernon and aunt petunia together as aunt marge'swhole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling
	she wasentirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and herhands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air, makingapoplectic popping noises
	ripper came skidding into the room, barkingmadly
	nooooooouncle vernon seized one of marge's feet and tried to pull her downagain, but was almost lifted from the floor himself
	a second later,ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into uncle vernon's leg
	harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him, headingfor the cupboard under the stairs
	the cupboard door burst magicallyopen as he reached it
	in seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the frontdoor
	he sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed, wrenching upthe loose floorboard, and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books andbirthday presents
	he wriggled out, seized hedwig's empty cage, anddashed back downstairs to his trunk, just as uncle vernon burst out ofthe dining room, his trouser leg in bloody tatters
	come back in here he bellowed
	come back and put her rightbut a reckless rage had come over harry
	he kicked his trunk open,pulled out his wand, and pointed it at uncle vernon
	she deserved it, harry said, breathing very fast
	she deserved whatshe got
	you keep away from me
	he fumbled behind him for the latch on the door
	i'm going, harry said
	and in the next moment, he was out in the dark, quiet street, heavinghis heavy trunk behind him, hedwig's cage under his arm
	chapter threethe knight busharry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall inmagnolia crescent, panting from the effort of dragging his trunk
	he satquite still, anger still surging through him, listening to the franticthumping of his heart
	but after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtookhim panic
	whichever way he looked at it, he had never been in a worsefix
	he was stranded, quite alone, in the dark muggle world, withabsolutely nowhere to go
	and the worst of it was, he had just doneserious magic, which meant that he was almost certainly expelled fromhogwarts
	he had broken the decree for the restriction of underagewizardry so badly, he was surprised ministry of magic representativesweren't swooping down on him where he sat
	harry shivered and looked up and down magnolia crescent
	what, was going to happen to him would he be arrested, or would hesimply be outlawed from the wizarding world he thought of ron andhermione, and his heart sank even lower
	harry was sure that, criminalor not, ron and hermione would want to help him now, but they were bothabroad, and with hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting them
	he didn't have any muggle money, either
	there was a little wizard goldin the money bag at the bottom of his trunk, but the rest of the fortunehis parents had left him was stored in a vault at gringotts wizardingbank in london
	he'd never be able to drag his trunk all the way tolondon
	he looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in his hand
	ifhe was already expelled his heart was
	now thumping painfully fast, abit more magic couldn't hurt
	he had the invisibility cloak he hadinherited from his father  what if he bewitched the trunk to make itfeatherlight, tied it to his broomstick, covered himself in the cloak,and flew to london then he could get the rest of his money out of hisvault and
	begin his life as an outcast
	it was a horrible prospect,but he couldn't sit on this wall forever, or he'd find himself trying toexplain to muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with atrunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick
	harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking forthe invisibility cloak  but before he had found it, he straightened upsuddenly, looking around him once more
	a funny prickling on the back of his neck had made harry feel he wasbeing watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lightsshone from any of the large square houses
	he bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more,his hand clenched on his wand
	he had sensed rather than heard itsomeone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garageand the fence behind him
	harry squinted at the black alleyway
	if onlyit would move, then he'd know whether it was just a stray cat or something else
	lumos, harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand,almost dazzling him
	he held it high over his head, and thepebbledashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled the garage doorgleamed, and between them harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulkingoutline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes
	harry stepped backward
	his legs hit his trunk and he tripped
	his wandflew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and helanded, hard, in the gutter there was a deafening bang, and harry threw up his hands to shield hiseyes against a sudden blinding light with a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time
	a secondlater, a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a haltexactly where harry had just been lying
	they belonged, as harry sawwhen he raised his head, to a tripledecker, violently purple bus, whichhad appeared out of thin air
	gold lettering over the windshield spelledthe knight bus
	for a split second, harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by hisfall
	then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus andbegan to speak loudly to the night
	welcome to the knight bus, emergency transport for the stranded witchor wizard
	just stick out your wand hand, step on board and we can takeyou anywhere you want to go
	my name is stan shunpike, and i will beyour conductor this eve the conductor stopped abruptly
	he had just caught sight of harry, whowas still sitting on the ground
	harry snatched up his wand again andscrambled to his feet
	close up, he saw that stan shunpike was only afew years older than he was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large,protruding ears and quite a few pimples
	what were you doin' down there said stan, dropping his professionalmanner
	fell over, said harry
	'choo fall over for sniggered stan
	i didn't do it on purpose, said harry, annoyed
	one of the knees inhis jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall wasbleeding
	he suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turnedaround quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence
	the knight bus's headlamps were flooding it with light, and it wasempty
	'choo lookin' at said stan
	there was a big black thing, said harry, pointing uncertainly into thegap
	he looked around at stan, whose mouth was slightly open
	with a feelingof unease, harry saw stan's eyes move to the scar on harry's forehead
	woss that on your 'ead said stan abruptly
	nothing, said harry quickly, flattening his hair over his scar
	if theministry of magic was looking for him, he didn't want to make it tooeasy for them
	woss your name stan persisted
	neville longbottom, said harry, saying the first name that came intohis head
	so  so this bus, he went on quickly, hoping to distractstan, did you say it goes anywhereyep, said stan proudly, anywhere you like, long's it's on land
	can'tdo nuffink underwater
	'ere, he said, looking suspicious again, ,youdid flag us down, dincha stuck out your wand 'and, dinchayes, said harry quickly
	listen, how much would it be to get tolondoneleven sickles, said stan, but for fifteen you get 'or chocolate, andfor fifteen you get an 'ot water bottle an' a toofbrush in the color ofyour choice
	harry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted his money bag, andshoved some gold into stan's hand
	he and stan then lifted his trunk,with hedwig's cage balanced on top, up the steps of the bus
	there were no seats instead, half a dozen brass bedsteads stood besidethe curtained windows
	candles were burning in brackets beside each bed,illuminating the woodpaneled walls
	a tiny wizard in a nightcap at therear of the bus muttered, not now, thanks, i'm pickling some slugs androlled over in his sleep
	you 'ave this one, stan whispered, shoving harry's trunk under the bedright behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair in front of thesteering wheel
	this is our driver, ernie prang
	this ,is nevillelongbottom, ern
	ernie prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded toharry, who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed
	take 'er away, ern, said stan, sitting down in the armchair next toernie's
	there was another tremendous bang, and the next moment harry foundhimself flat on his bed, thrown backward by the speed of the knight bus
	pulling himself up, harry stared out of the dark window and saw thatthey were now bowling along a completely different street
	stan waswatching harry's stunned face with great enjoyment
	this is where we was before you flagged us down, he said
	where arewe, ern somewhere in walesar, said ernie
	how come the muggles don't hear the bus said harry
	them said stan contemptuously
	don' listen properly, do they don'look properly either
	never notice nuffink, they don'
	best go wake up madam marsh, stan, said ern
	we'll be in abergavennyin a minute
	stan passed harry's bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase
	harry was still looking out of the window, feeling increasingly nervous
	ernie didn't seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel
	theknight bus kept mounting the pavement, but it didn't hit anything linesof lampposts, mailboxes, and trash cans jumped out of its way as itapproached and back into position once it had passed
	stan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch wrapped ina traveling cloak
	'ere you go, madam marsh, said stan happily as ern stamped on thebrake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus
	madammarsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps
	stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut there wasanother loud bang, and they were thundering down a narrow country lane,trees leaping out of the way
	harry wouldn't have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling ona bus that didn't keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at atime
	his stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going tohappen to him, and whether the dursleys had managed to get aunt margeoff the ceiling yet
	stan had unfurled a copy of the daily prophet and was now reading withhis tongue between his teeth
	a large photograph of a sunkenfaced manwith long, matted hair blinked slowly at harry from the front page
	helooked strangely familiar
	that man harry said, forgetting his troubles for a moment
	he was onthe muggle newsstanley turned to the front page and chuckled
	sirius black, he said, nodding
	'course 'e was on the muggle news,neville, where you beenhe gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on harry's face,removed the front page, and handed it to harry
	you oughta read the papers more, neville
	harry held the paper up to the candlelight and readblack still at largesirius black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held inazkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the ministry of magicconfirmed today
	we are doing all we can to recapture black, said the minister ofmagic, cornelius fudge, this morning, and we beg the magical communityto remain calm
	fudge has been criticized by some members of the internationalfederation of warlocks for informing the muggle prime minister of thecrisis
	well, really, i had to, don't you know, said an irritable fudge
	he's a danger to anyone who crosses him, magic or muggle
	i have the prime minister's assurance that he will not breathe a word ofblack's true identity to anyone
	and let's face itwho'd believe him ifhe didwhile muggles have been told that black is carrying a gun a kind ofmetal wand that muggles use to kill each other, the magical communitylives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when blackmurdered thirteen people with a single curse
	harry looked into the shadowed eyes of sirius black, the only part ofthe sunken face that seemed alive
	harry had never met a vampire, but hehad seen pictures of them in his defense against the dark arts classes,and black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one
	scarylookin' fing, inee said stan, who had been watching harry read
	he murdered thirteen people said harry, handing the page back tostan, with one curseyep, said stan, in front of witnesses an' all
	bigtrouble it caused, dinnit, ernar, said ern darkly
	stan swiveled in his armchair, his hands on the back, the better to lookat harry
	black woz a big supporter of youknow'oo, he said
	what, voldemort said harry, without thinking
	even stan's pimples went white ern jerked the steering wheel so hardthat a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus
	you outta your tree yelped stan
	'choo say 'is name forsorry, said harry hastily
	sorry, i  i forgot forgot said stan weakly
	blimey, my 'eart's goin' that fast
	so  so black was a supporter of youknowwho harry promptedapologetically
	yeah, said stan, still rubbing his chest
	veryclose to youknow'oo, they say
	anyway, when little 'arry potter gotthe better of youknow'oo harry nervously flattened his bangs down again
	all youknow'oo's supporters was tracked down, wasn't they, ernmost of 'em knew it was all over, wiv youknow'oo gone, and they camequiet
	but not sirius black
	i 'eard he thought 'e'd besecondincommand once youknow'oo 'ad taken over
	anyway, they cornered black in the middle of a street full of mugglesan' black took out 'is wand and 'e blasted 'alf the street apart, an' awizard got it, an' so did a dozen muggles what got in the way
	'orrible,eh an' you know what black did then stan continued in a dramaticwhisper
	jus' stood there an' laughed
	an' whenreinforcements from the ministry of magic got there, i 'e went wiv emquiet as anyfink, still laughing 'is 'ead off
	'cos 'e's mad, inee, erninee madif he weren't when he went to azkaban, he will be now, said ern in hisslow voice
	i'd blow meself up before i set foot in that place
	serveshim right, mind you
	they 'ad a job coverin' it up, din' they, ern stan said
	'ole streetblown up an' all them muggles dead
	what was it they said ad 'appened,erngas explosion, grunted ernie
	an' now 'e's out, said stan, examining the newspaper picture ofblack's gaunt face again
	never been a breakout from azkaban before,'as there, ern beats me 'ow 'e did it
	frightenin', eh mind, i don'tfancy 'is chances against them azkaban guards, eh, ernernie suddenly shivered
	talk about summat else, stan, there's a good lad
	them azkaban guardsgive me the collywobbles
	stan put the paper away reluctantly, and harry leaned against the windowof the knight bus, feeling worse than ever
	he couldn't help imaginingwhat stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights' time
	'ear about that 'arry potter blew up 'is aunt we 'ad 'im 'ere on theknight bus, di'n't we, ern 'e was tryin' i to run for it
	he, harry, had broken wizard law just like sirius black
	was inflatingaunt marge bad enough to land him in azkaban harry didn't know anythingabout the wizard prison, though everyone he'd ever heard speak of it didso in the same fearful tone
	hagrid, the hogwarts gamekeeper, had spenttwo months there only last year
	harry wouldn't soon forget the look ofterror on hagrid's face when he had been told where he was going, andhagrid was one of the bravest people harry knew
	the knight bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes andwastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and harry lay, restless andmiserable, on his feather bed
	after a while, stan remembered that harryhad paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over harry's pillow whenthe bus moved abruptly from anglesea to aberdeen
	one by one, wizardsand witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upperfloors to leave the bus
	they all looked very pleased to go
	finally, harry was the only passenger left
	right then, neville, said stan, clapping his hands, where abouts inlondondiagon alley, said harry
	they were thundering along charing cross road
	harry sat up and watchedbuildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the knight bus's way
	the sky was getting a little lighter
	he would lie low for a couple ofhours, go to gringotts the
	moment it opened, then set off  where, hedidn't know
	ern slammed on the brakes and the knight bus skidded to a halt in frontof a small and shabby looking pub, the leaky cauldron, behind which laythe magical entrance to diagon alley
	thanks, harry said to ern
	he jumped down the steps and helped stan lower his trunk and hedwig'scage onto the pavement
	'bye thenbut stan wasn't paying attention
	still standing in the doorway to thebus he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the leaky cauldron
	there you are, harry, said a voice
	before harry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder
	at the sametime, stan shouted, blimey ern, come 'ere come 'ere iharry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt abucketful of ice cascade into his stomach  he had walked right intocornelius fudge, the minister of magic himself
	stan leapt onto the pavement beside them
	what didja call neville, minister he said excitedly
	fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold andexhausted
	neville he repeated, frowning
	this is harry potter
	i knew it stan shouted gleefully
	ern ern guess 'oo neville is,ern 'e's 'arry potter i can see 'is scaryes, said fudge testily, well, i'm very glad the knight bus pickedharry up, but he and i need to step inside the leaky cauldron now
	fudge increased the pressure on harry's shoulder, and harry foundhimself being steered inside the pub
	a stooping figure bearing alantern appeared through the door behind the bar
	it was tom, thewizened, toothless landlord
	you've got him, minister said tom
	will you be wanting anythingbeer brandyperhaps a pot of tea, said fudge, who still hadn't let go of harry
	there was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and stan and ernappeared, carrying harry's trunk and hedwig's cage and looking aroundexcitedly
	'ow come you di'n't tell us 'oo you are, eh, neville said stan,beaming at harry, while ernie's owlish face peered interestedly overstan's shoulder
	and a private parlor, please, tom, said fudge pointedly
	bye, harry said miserably to stan and ern as tom beckoned fudge towardthe passage that led from the bar
	'bye, neville called stan
	fudge marched harry along the narrow passage after tom's lantern, andthen into a small parlor
	tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst intolife in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room
	sit down, harry, said fudge, indicating a chair by the fire
	harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glowof the fire
	fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside,then hitched up the trousers of his bottlegreen suit and sat downopposite harry
	i am cornelius fudge, harry
	the minister of magic
	harry already knew this, of course he had seen fudge once before, butas he had been wearing his father's invisibility cloak at the time,fudge wasn't to know that
	tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his nightshirt andbearing a tray of tea and crumpets
	he placed the tray on a tablebetween fudge and harry and left the parlor, closing the door behindhim
	well, harry, said fudge, pouring out tea, you've had us all in aright flap, i don't mind telling you
	running away from your aunt anduncle's house like that i'd started to think
	but you're safe, andthat's what matters
	fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward harry
	eat, harry, you look dead on your feet
	you will be pleasedto hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowingup of missmarjorie dursley
	two members of the accidental magic reversaldepartment were dispatched to privet drive a few hours ago
	miss dursleyhas been punctured and her memory has been modified
	she has norecollection of the incident at all
	so that's that, and no harm done
	fudge smiled at harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an unclesurveying a favorite nephew
	harry, who couldn't believe his ears,opened his mouth to speak, couldn't think of anything to say, and closedit again
	ah, you're worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle saidfudge
	well, i won't deny that they are extremely angry, harry, butthey are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay athogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays
	harry unstuck his throat
	i always stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays, hesaid, and i don't ever want to go back to privet drive
	now, now, i'm sure you'll feel differently once you've calmed down,said fudge in a worried tone
	they are your family, after all, and i'msure you are fond of each other  er  very deep down
	it didn't occur to harry to put fudge right
	he was still waiting tohear what was going to happen to him now
	so all that remains, said fudge, now buttering himself a secondcrumpet, is to decide where you're going to spend the last two weeks ofyour vacation
	i suggest you take a room here at the leaky cauldron andhang on, blurted harry
	what about my punishmentfudge blinked
	punishmenti broke the law harry said
	the decree for the restriction ofunderage wizardryoh, my dear boy, we're not going to punish you for a little thing likethat cried fudge, waving his crumpet impatiently
	it was an accidentwe don't send people to azkaban just for blowing up their auntsbut this didn't tally at all with harry's past dealings with theministry of magic
	last year, i got an official warning just because a houseelf smashed apudding in my uncle's house he told fudge, frowning
	the ministry ofmagic said i'd be expelled from hogwarts if there was any more magicthereunless harry's eyes were deceiving him, fudge was suddenly lookingawkward
	circumstances change, harry
	we have to take into account
	in thepresent climate
	surely you don't want to be expelledof course i don't, said harry
	well then, what's a the fuss about laughed fudge
	now, have acrumpet, harry, while i go and see if tom's got a room for you
	fudge strode out of the parlor and harry stared after him
	there wassomething extremely odd going on
	why had fudge been waiting for him atthe leaky cauldron, if not to punish him for what he'd done and nowharry came to think of it, surely it wasn't usual for the minister ofmagic himself to get involved in matters of underage magicfudge came back, accompanied by tom the innkeeper
	room eleven's free, harry, said fudge
	i think you'll be verycomfortable
	just one thing, and i'm sure you'll understand
	i don'twant you wandering off into muggle london, all right keep to diagonalley
	and you're to be back here before dark each night
	sure you'llunderstand
	tom will be keeping an eye on you for me
	okay, said harry slowly, but whydon't want to lose you again, do we said fudge with a hearty laugh
	best we know where you are
	fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak
	well, i'll be off, plenty to do, you know
	have you had any luck with black yet harry asked
	fudge's finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak
	what's that oh, you've heard  well, no, not yet, but it's only amatter of time
	the azkaban guards have never yet failed
	and they areangrier than i've ever seen them
	fudge shuddered slightly
	he held out his hand and harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea
	er  minister can i ask you somethingcertainly, said fudge with a smile
	well, third years at hogwarts are allowed to visit hogsmeade, but myaunt and uncle didn't sign the permission form
	d'you think you couldfudge was looking uncomfortable
	no, no, i'm very sorry, harry, but as i'm not yourparent or guardian but you i re the minister of magic, said harry eagerly
	if you gaveme permissionno, i'm sorry, harry, but rules are rules, said fudge flatly
	'perhaps you'll be able to visit hogsmeade next year
	in fact, i thinkit's best if you don't
	well, i'll be off enjoy your stay,harry
	and with a last smile and shake of harry's hand, fudge left the room
	tom now moved forward, beaming at harry
	if you'll follow me, mr
	potter, he said, i've already taken yourthings up
	harry followed tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brassnumber eleven on it, which tom unlocked and opened for him
	inside was a very comfortablelooking bed, some highly polished oakfurniture, a cheerfully crackling fire and, perched on top of thewardrobe hedwig harry gasped
	the snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto harry's arm
	very smart owl you've got there, chuckled tom
	arrived about fiveminutes after you did
	if there's anything you need, mr
	potter, don'thesitate to ask
	he gave another bow and left
	harry sat on his bed for a long time, absentmindedly stroking hedwig
	the sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep, velvety blueto cold, steely gray and then, slowly, to pink shot with gold
	harrycould hardly believe that he'd left privet drive only a few hours ago,that he wasn't expelled, and that he was now facing two completelydursleyfree weeks
	it's been a very weird night, hedwig, he yawned
	and without even removing his glasses, he slumped back onto his pillowsand fell asleep
	chapter fourthe leaky cauldronit took harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom
	neverbefore had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever hefancied
	he could even go wherever he pleased, as long as it was indiagon alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the mostfascinating wizarding shops in the world, harry felt no desire to breakhis word to fudge and stray back into the muggle world
	harry ate breakfast each morning in the leaky cauldron, where he likedwatching the other guests funny little witches from the country, up fora day's shopping venerablelooking wizards arguing over the latestarticle in transfiguration today wildlooking warlocks raucous dwarfsand once, what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate ofraw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava
	after breakfast harry would go out into the backyard, take out his wand,tap the third brick from the left above the trash bit,, and stand backas the archway into diagon alley opened in the wall
	harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under thebrightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where his fellow diners wereshowing one another their purchases   it , s a lunascope, old boy no more messing around with moon charts, see or else discussing thecase of sirius black personalty, i won't let any of the children outalone until he's back in azkaban
	harry didn't have to do his homeworkunder the blankets by flashlight anymore now he could sit in the brightsunshine outside florean fortescue's ice cream parlor, finishing all hisessays with occasional help from florean fortescue himself, who, apartfrom knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave harry freesundaes every half an hour
	once harry had refilled his money bag with gold galleons, silversickles, and bronze knuts from his vault at gringotts, he had toexercise a lot of selfcontrol not to spend the whole lot at once
	hehad to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at hogwarts,and how it would feel to ask the dursleys for money for spellbooks, tostop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold gobstones awizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt anastysmelling liquid into the other player's face when they lose apoint
	he was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, moving model of thegalaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant he never had totake another astronomy lesson
	but the thing that tested harry'sresolution most appeared in his favorite shop, quality quidditchsupplies, a week after he'd arrived at the leaky cauldron
	curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at, harry edgedhis way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizardsuntil he glimpsed a newly erected podium, on which was mounted the mostmagnificent broom he had ever seen in his life
	just come out  prototype  a squarejawed wizard was telling hiscompanion
	it's the fastest broom in the world, isn't it, dad squeaked a boyyounger than harry, who was swinging off his father's arm
	irish international side's just put in an order for seven of thesebeauties the proprietor of the shop told the crowd
	and they'refavorites for the world cupa large witch in front of harry moved, and he was able to read the signnext to the broom the firebolt this stateoftheart pacing broom sports a streamlined, superfinehandle of ash, treated with a diamondhard polish and hand numberedwith its own registration number
	each individually selected birch twigin the broomtail has been honed to aerodynamic perfection, giving thefirebolt unsurpassable balance and pinpoint precision
	the firebolt hasan acceleration of 150 miles an hour in ten seconds and incorporates anunbreakable braking charm
	harry didn't like to think how much gold thefirebolt would cost
	he had never wanted anything as much in his wholelife  but he had never lost a quidditch match on his nim bus twothousand, and what was the point in emptying his gringotts vault for thefirebolt, when he had a very good broom already harry didn't ask forthe price, but he returned, almost every day after that, just to look atthe firebolt
	there were, however, things that harry needed to buy
	he went to theapothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients, and as hisschool robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, hevisited madam malkin's robes for all occasions and bought new ones
	mostimportant of all, he had to buy his new schoolbooks, which would includethose for his two new subjects, care of magical creatures anddivination
	harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window
	instead ofthe usual display of gold embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs,there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundredcopies of the monster book of monsters
	torn pages were flyingeverywhere as the books grappled with each other, locked together infurious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively
	harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for thefirst time
	the monster book of monsters was listed as the required bookfor care of magical creatures
	now harry understood why hagrid had saidit would come in useful
	he felt relieved he had been wondering whetherhagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet
	as harry entered flourish and blotts, the manager came hurrying towardhim
	hogwarts he said abruptly
	come to get your new booksyes, said harry, i need get out of the way, said the manager impatiently, brushing harryaside
	he drew on a pair of very thick gloves, picked up a large,knobbly walking stick, and proceeded toward the door of the monsterbooks' cage
	hang on, said harry quickly, i've already got one of those
	have you a look of enormous relief spread over the manager's face
	thank heavens for that
	i've been bitten five times already thismorning a loud ripping noise rent the air two of the monster books had seized athird and were pulling it apart
	stop it stop it cried the manager, poking the walking stick throughthe bars and knocking the books apart
	i'm never stocking them again,never it's been bedlam i thought we'd seen the worst when we boughttwo hundred copies of the invisible book of invisibility cost afortune, and we never found them
	is there anything else ican help you withyes, said harry, looking down his booklist, i need unfogging thefuture by cassandra vablatsky
	ah, starting divination, are you said the manager, stripping off hisgloves and leading harry into the back of the shop, where there was acorner devoted to fortunetelling
	a small table was stacked withvolumes such as predicting the unpredictable insulate yourself againstshocks and broken balls when fortunes turn foul
	here you are,,' said the manager, who had climbed a set of steps totake down a thick, black bound book
	unfogging the future
	very goodguide to all your basic fortunetelling methods  palmistry, crystalballs, bird entrails
	but harry wasn't listening
	his eyes had fallen on another book, whichwas among a display on a small table death omens
	what to do when youknow the worst is coming
	oh, i wouldn't read that if i were you, said the manager lightly,looking to see what harry was staring at
	you'll start seeing deathomens everywhere
	it's enough to frighten anyone to death
	but harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book it showed ablack dog large as a bear, with gleaming eyes
	it looked oddlyfamiliar
	the manager pressed unfogging the future into harry's hands
	anything else he said
	yes, said harry, tearing his eyes away from the dog's and dazedlyconsulting his booklist
	er  i need intermediate transfiguration andthe standard book of spells, grade three
	harry emerged from flourish and blotts ten minutes later with his newbooks under his arms and made his way back to the leaky cauldron, hardlynoticing where he was going and bumping into several people
	he tramped up the stairs to his room, went inside, and tipped his booksonto his bed
	somebody had been in to tidy the windows were open andsun was pouring inside
	harry could hear the buses rolling by in theunseen muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowdbelow in diagon alley
	he caught sight of himself in the mirror over thebasin
	it can't have been a death omen, he told his reflection defiantly
	iwas panicking when i saw that thing in magnolia crescent
	it wasprobably just a stray dog
	he raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flatyou're fighting a losing battle there, dear, said his mirror in avvheezy voice
	as the days slipped by, harry started looking wherever he went for asign of ron or hermione
	plenty of hogwarts students were arriving indiagon alley now, with the start of term so near
	harry met seamusfinnigan and dean thomas, his fellow gryffindors, in quality quidditchsupplies, where they too were ogling the firebolt he also ran into thereal neville longbottom, a roundfaced, forgetful boy, outside flourishand blotts
	harry didn't stop to chat neville appeared to have mislaidhis booklist and was being told off by his very formidablelookinggrandmother
	harry hoped she never found out that he'd pretended to beneville while on the run from the ministry of magic
	harry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that he would atleast meet ron and hermione tomorrow, on the hogwarts express
	he gotup, dressed, went for a last look at the firebolt, and was justwondering where he'd have lunch, when someone yelled his name and heturned
	harry harrythey were there, both of them, sitting outside florean fortescue's icecream parlor  ron looking incredibly freckly, her,,one very brown,both waving frantically at him
	finally said ron, grinning at harry as he sat down
	we went to theleaky cauldron, but they said you'd left, and we went to flourish andblotts, and madam malkin's, and i got all my school stuff last week, harry explained
	and how comeyou knew i'm staying at the leaky cauldron dad, said ron simply
	weasley, who worked at the ministry of magic, would of course haveheard the whole story of what had happened to aunt marge
	did you really blow up your aunt, harry said hermione in a veryserious voice
	i didn't mean to, said harry, while ron roared with laughter
	it's not funny, ron, said hermione sharply
	honestly, i'm amazedharry wasn't expelled
	so am i, admitted harry
	forget expelled, i thought i was going to bearrested
	your dad doesn't know why fudge let meoff, does heprobably 'cause it's you, isn't it shrugged ron, still chuckling
	famous harry potter and all that
	i'd hate to see what the ministry'ddo to me if i blew up an aunt
	mind you, they'd have to dig me up first,because mum would've killed me
	anyway, you can ask dad yourself thisevening
	we're staying at the leaky cauldron tonight too so you cancome to king's cross with us tomorrow hermione's there as wellhermione nodded, beaming
	mum and dad dropped me off this morning withall my hogwarts things
	excellent said harry happily
	so, have you got all your new booksand stufflook at this, said ron, pulling a long thin box out of a bag andopening it
	fourteen inches, willow, containing oneunicorn tailhair
	and we've got all our books  he pointed at a largebag under his chair
	what about those monster books, eh the assistantnearly cried when we said we wanted two
	what's all that, hermione harry asked, pointing at not one but threebulging bags in the chair next to her
	,,well, i'm taking more new subjects than you, aren't if' said hermione
	those are my books for arithmancy, care of magical creatures,divination, the study of ancient runes, muggle studies what are you doing muggle studies for said ron, rolling his eyes atharry
	you're muggle born your mum and dad are muggles you alreadyknow all about mugglesbut it'll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point ofview, said hermione earnestly
	are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, hermione askedharry, while ron sniggered
	hermione ignored them
	i've still got ten galleons, she said, checking her purse
	it's mybirthday in september, and mum and dad gave me some money to get myselfan early birthday present
	how about a nice book said ron innocently
	no, i don't think so, said hermione composedly
	i really want an owl
	i mean, harry's got hedwig and you've got errol i haven't, said ron
	errol's a family owl
	all i've got is scabbers
	he pulled his pet rat out of his pocket
	and i want to get him checkedover, he added, placing scabbers on the table in front of them
	idon't think egypt agreed with him
	scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droopto his whiskers
	there's a magical creature shop just over there, said harry, who knewdiagon alley very well by now
	you could see if they've got anythingfor scabbers, and hermione can get her owl,so they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the magicalmenagerie
	there wasn't much room inside
	every inch of wall was hidden by cages
	it was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages wereall squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing
	the witch behind thecounter was already advising a wizard on the care of doubleended newts,so harry, ron, and hermione waited, examining the cages
	a pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on deadblowflies
	a gigantic tortoise with a jewelencrusted shell wasglittering near the window
	poisonous orange snails were oozing slowlyup the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept changinginto a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise
	then therewere cats of every color, a noisy cage of ravens, a basket of funnycustardcolored furballs that were humming loudly, and on the counter, avast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skippinggame using their long, bald tails
	the doubleended newt wizard left, and ron approached the counter
	it's my rat, he told the witch
	he been a bit offcolor ever since ibrought him back from egypt
	bang him on the counter, said the witch, pulling a pair of heavy blackspectacles out of her pocket
	ron lifted scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to thecage of his fellow rats, who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffledto the wire for a better took
	like nearly everything ron owned, scabbers the rat was secondhand hehad once belonged to ron's brother percy and a bit battered
	next tothe glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially woebegone
	hm, said the witch, picking up scabbers
	how old is this ratdunno, said ron
	he used to belong to my brother
	what powers does he have said the witch, examining scabbers closely
	er  the truth was that scabbers had never shown the faintest traceof interesting powers
	the witchs eyes moved from scabbers's tatteredleft ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly
	he's been through the mill, this one, she said
	he was like that when percy gave him to me, said ron defensively
	an ordinary common or garden rat like this can't be expected to livelonger than three years or so, said the witch
	now, if you werelooking for something a bit more hardwearing, you might like one ofthese she indicated the black rats, who promptly started skipping again
	ronmuttered, showoffs
	well, if you don't want a replacement, you can try this rat tonic,said the witch, reaching under the counter and bringing out a small redbottle
	how much  ouchron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top ofthe highest cage, landed on his head, and then propelled itself,spitting madly, at scabbers
	no, crookshanks, no cried the witch, but scabbers, shot from betweenher hands like a bar of soap, landed splaylegged on the floor, and thenscampered for the door
	scabbers ron shouted, racing out of the shop after him harryfollowed
	it took them nearly ten minutes to catch scabbers, who had taken refugeunder a wastepaper bin outside quality quidditch supplies
	ron stuffedthe trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up, massaginghis head
	what was thatit was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger, said harry
	where's hermioneprobably getting her owlthey made their way back up the crowded street to the magical menagerie
	as they reached it, hermione came out, but she wasn't carrying an owl
	her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat
	you bought that monster said ron, his mouth hanging open
	he's gorgeous, isn't he said hermione, glowing
	that was a matter of opinion, thought harry
	the cat's ginger fur wasthick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its facelooked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into abrick wall
	now that scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat waspurring contentedly in hermione's arms
	herinione, that thing nearly scalped me said ron
	he didn't mean to, did you, crookshanks said hermione
	and what about scabbers said ron, pointing at the lump in his chestpocket
	he needs rest and relaxation how's he going to get it withthat thing aroundthat reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic, said hermione, slappingthe small red bottle into ron's hand
	and stop worrying, crookshankswill be sleeping in my dormitory and scabbers in yours, what's theproblem poor crookshanks, that witch said he'd been in there for agesno one wanted him
	wonder why, said ron sarcastically as they set off toward the leakycauldron
	weasley sitting in the bar, reading the daily prophet
	harry he said, smiling as he looked up
	how are youfine, thanks, said harry as he, ron, and hermione joined mr
	weasleywith a their shopping
	weasley put down his paper, and harry saw the now familiar pictureof sirius black staring up at him
	they still haven't caught him, then he asked
	weasley, looking extremely grave
	they've pulled us alloff our regular jobs at the ministry to try and find him, but no luck sofar
	would we get a reward if we caught him asked ron
	it'd be good toget some more money don't be ridiculous, ron, said mr
	weasley, who on closer inspectionlooked very strained
	black's not going to be caught by athirteenyearold wizard
	it's the azkaban guards who'll get him back,you mark my words
	weasley entered the bar, laden with shopping bagsand followed by the twins, fred and george, who were about to starttheir fifth year at hogwarts the newly elected head boy, percy and theweasleys' youngest child and only girl, ginny
	ginny, who had always been very taken with harry, seemed even moreheartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him, perhaps because he hadsaved her life during their previous year at hogwarts
	she went very redand muttered hello without looking at him
	percy, however, held outhis hand solemnly as though he and harry had never met and said, harry
	hello, percy, said harry, trying not to laugh
	i hope you're well said percy pompously, shaking hands
	it was ratherlike being introduced to the mayor
	very well, thanks harry said fred, elbowing percy out of the way and bowing deeply
	simply splendid to see you, old boy marvelous, said george, pushing fred aside and seizing harry's hand inturn
	that's enough, now, said mrs
	mum said fred as though he'd only just spotted her and seizing herhand too
	how really corking to see you i said, that's enough, said mrs
	weasley, depositing her shopping inan empty chair
	i suppose you've heard our excitingnews she pointed to the brandnew silver badge on percy's chest
	second head boy in the family she said, swelling with pride
	and last, fred muttered under his breath
	i don't doubt that, said mrs
	weasley, frowning suddenly
	i noticethey haven't made you two prefects
	what do we want to be prefects for said george, looking revolted atthe very idea
	it'd take all the fun out of life
	yo u want to set a better example for your sister snapped mrs
	ginny's got other brothers to set her an example, mother, said percyloftily
	i'm going up to change for dinner
	he disappeared and george heaved a sigh
	we tried to shut him in a pyramid, he told harry
	dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair
	tom the innkeeper putthree tables together in the parlor, and the seven weasleys, harry, andhermione ate their way through five delicious courses
	how're we getting to king's cross tomorrow, dad asked fred as theydug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding
	the ministry's providing a couple of cars, said mr
	everyone looked up at him
	why said percy curiously
	it's because of you, perce, said george seriously
	and there'll belittle flags on the hoods, with hb on them for humongous bighead, said fred
	everyone except percy and mrs
	weasley snorted into their pudding
	why are the ministry providing cars, father percy asked again, in adignified voice
	well, as we haven't got one anymore, said mr
	weasley, and as i work there, they're doing me a favor his voice was casual, but harry couldn't help noticing that mr
	weasley's ears had gone red, just like ron's did when he was underpressure
	good thing, too, said mrs
	do you realize how muchluggage you've all got between you a nice sight you'd be on the muggleunderground
	you are all packed, aren't youron hasn't put all his new things in his trunk yet, said percy, in alongsuffering voice
	he's dumped them on my bed
	you'd better go and pack properly, ron, because we won't have much timein the morning, mrs
	weasley called down the table
	after dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy
	one by one they madetheir way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the nextday
	ron and percy were next door to harry
	he had just closed andlocked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall, andwent to see what was going on
	the door of number twelve was ajar and percy was shouting
	it was here, on the bedside table, i took it off for polishingi haven't touched it, all right ron roared back
	my head boy badge is gone, said percy, rounding on harry
	so's scabbers's rat tonic, said ron, throwing things out of his trunkto look
	i think i might've left it in the bar you're not going anywhere till you've found my badge yelled percy
	i'll get scabbers's stuff, i'm packed, harry said to ron, and he wentdownstairs
	harry was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark,when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor
	asecond later, he recognized them as mr
	he hesitated, not wanting them to know he'd heard themarguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, then move closerto the parlor door
	makes no sense not to tell him, mr
	weasley was saying heatedly
	harry's got a right to know
	i've tried to tell fudge, but he insistson treating harry like a child
	he's thirteen years old and arthur, the truth would terrify him said mrs
	doyou really want to send harry back to school with that hanging over himfor heaven's sake, he's happy not knowingi don't want to make him miserable, i want to put him on his guardretorted mr
	you know what harry and ron are like, wanderingoff by themselves  they've ended up in the forbidden forest twice butharry mustn't do that this year when i think what could have happenedto him that night he ran away from home if the knight bus hadn't pickedhim up, i'm prepared to bet he would have been dead before the ministryfound him
	but he's not dead, he's fine, so what's the pointmolly, they say sirius black's mad, and maybe he is, but he was cleverenough to escape from azkaban, and that's supposed to be impossible
	it's been three weeks, and no one's seen hide nor hair of him, and idon't care what fudge keeps telling the daily prophet, we're no nearercatching black than inventing selfspelling wands
	the only thing weknow for sure is what black's afterbut harry will be perfectly safe at hogwarts
	we thought azkaban was perfectly safe
	if black can break out ofazkaban, he can break into hogwarts
	but no one's really sure that black's after harrythere was a thud on wood, and harry was sure mr
	weasley had banged hisfist on the table
	molly, how many times do i have to tell you they didn't report it inthe press because fudge wanted it kept quiet, but fudge went out toazkaban the night black escaped
	the guards told fudge that blacks beentalking in his sleep for a while now
	always the same words 'he's athogwarts
	' black is deranged, molly, and he wantsharry dead
	if you ask me, he thinks murdering harry will bringyouknowwho back to pow er
	black lost everything the night harrystopped you knowwho, and he's had twelve years alone in azkaban tobrood on that
	harry leaned still closer to the door, desperate tohear more
	well, arthur, you must do what you think is right
	but you'reforgetting albus dumbledore
	i don't think anything could hurt harry athogwarts while dumbledore's headmaster
	i suppose he knows about allthisof course he knows
	we had to ask him if he minds the azkaban guardsstationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds
	hewasn't happy about it, but he agreed
	not happy why shouldn't he be happy, if they're there to catch blackdumbledore isn't fond of the azkaban guards, said mr
	nor am 1, if it comes to that
	but when you're dealing with a wizardlike black, you sometimes have to join forces with those you'd ratheravoid
	if they save harry then i will never say another word against them,said mr
	it's late, molly, we'd better go up
	harry heard chairs move
	as quietly as he could, he hurried down thepassage to the bar and out of sight
	the parlor door opened, and a fewseconds later footsteps told him that mr
	weasley were climbingthe stairs
	the bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat atearlier
	harry waited until he heard mr
	weasley's bedroom doorclose, then headed back upstairs with the bottle
	fred and george were crouching in the shadows on the landing, heavingwith laughter as they listened to percy dismantling his and ron's roomin search of his badge
	we've got it, fred whispered to harry
	we've been improving it
	the badge now read bighead boy
	harry forced a laugh, went to give ron the rat tonic, then shut himselfin his room and lay down on his bed
	so sirius black was after him
	this explained everything
	fudge had beenlenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive
	he'd madeharry promise to stay in diagon alley where there were plenty of wizardsto keep an eye on him
	and he was sending two ministry cars to take themall to the station tomorrow, so that the weasleys could look after harryuntil he was on the train
	harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered whyhe didn't feel more scared
	sirius black had murdered thirteen peoplewith one curse mr
	and mrs, weasley obviously thought harry would bepanicstricken if he knew the truth
	but harry happened to agreewholeheartedly with mrs
	weasley that the safest place on earth waswherever albus dumbledore happened to be
	didn't people always say thatdumbledore was the only person lord voldemort had ever been afraid ofsurely black, as voldemort's righthand man, would be just as frightenedof himand then there were these azkaban guards everyone kept talking about
	they seemed to scare most people senseless, and if they were stationedall around the school, black's chances of getting inside seemed veryremote
	no, all in all, the thing that bothered harry most was the fact that hischances of visiting hogsmeade now looked like zero
	nobody would wantharry to leave the safety of the castle until black was caught in fact,harry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until thedanger had passed
	he scowled at the dark ceiling
	did they think he couldn't look afterhimself he'd escaped lord voldemort three times he wasn't completelyuseless
	unbidden, the image of the beast in the shadows of magnolia crescentcrossed his mind
	what to do when you know the worst is coming
	i'm not going to be murdered, harry said out loud
	that's the spirit, dear, said his mirror sleepily
	chapter fivethe dementortom woke harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cupof tea
	harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled hedwigto get back into her cage when ron banged his way into the room, pullinga sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable
	the sooner we get on the train, the better, he said
	at least i canget away from percy at hogwarts
	now he's accusing me of dripping tea onhis photo of penelope clearwater
	you know, ron grimaced, hisgirlfriend
	she's hidden her face under the frame because her nose hasgone all blotchy
	i've got something to tell you, harry began, but they were interruptedby fred and george, who had looked in to congratulate ron on infuriatingpercy again
	they headed down to breakfast, where mr
	weasley was reading the frontpage of the daily prophet with a furrowed brow and mrs
	weasley wastelling hermione and ginny about a love potion she'd made as a younggirl
	all three of them were rather giggly
	what were you saying ron asked harry as they sat down
	later, harry muttered as percy stormed in
	harry had no chance to speak to ron or hermione in the chaos of leavingthey were too busy heaving all their trunks down the leaky cauldron'snarrow staircase and piling them up near the door, with hedwig andhermes, percy's screech owl, perched on top in their cages
	a smallwickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly
	it's all right, crookshanks, hermione cooed through the wickerwork
	i'll let you out on the train
	you won't, snapped ron
	what about poor scabbers, ehhe pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated that scabbers wascurled up in his pocket
	weasley, who had been outside waiting for the ministry cars, stuckhis head inside
	they're here, he said
	weasley marched harry across the short stretch of pavement towardthe first of two old fashioned dark green cars, each of which wasdriven by a furtivelooking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet
	in you get, harry, said mr
	weasley, glancing up and down the crowdedstreet
	harry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by hermione,ron, and, to ron's disgust, percy
	the journey to king's cross was very uneventful compared with harry'strip on the knight bus
	the ministry of magic cars seemed almostordinary
	though harry noticed that they could slide through gaps thatuncle vernon's new company car certainly couldn't have managed
	theyreached king's cross with twenty minutes to spare the ministry driversfound them trolleys, unloaded their trunks, touched their hats in saluteto mr
	weasley, and drove away, somehow managing to jump to the head ofan unmoving line at the traffic lights
	weasley kept close to harry's elbow all the way into the station
	right then, he said, glancing around them
	let's do this in pairs, asthere are so many of us
	i'll go through first with harry
	weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten,pushing harry's trolley and apparently very interested in the intercity125 that had just arrived at platform nine
	with a meaningful look atharry, he leaned casually against the barrier
	in a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal ontoplatform nine and three quarters and looked up to see the hogwartsexpress, a scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packedwith witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train
	percy and ginny suddenly appeared behind harry
	they were panting andhad apparently taken the barrier at a run
	ah, there's penelope said percy, smoothing his hair and going pinkagain
	ginny caught harry's eye, and they both turned away to hide theirlaughter as percy strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walkingwith his chest thrown out so that she couldn't miss his shiny badge
	stood back to let him on
	they leaned out of the window and waved at mr
	weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them fromview
	i need to talk to you in private, harry muttered to ron and hermioneas the train picked up speed
	go away, ginny, said ron
	oh, that's nice, said ginny huffily, and she stalked off
	harry, ron, and hermione set off down the corridor, looking for an emptycompartment, but all were full except for the one at the very end of thetrain
	this had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep next to thewindow
	harry, ron, and hermione checked on the threshold
	the hogwartsexpress was usually reserved for students and they had never seen anadult there before, except for the witch who pushed the food cart
	the stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizard's robes thathad been darned in several places
	he looked ill and exhausted
	thoughquite young, his light brown hair was flecked with gray
	who d'you reckon he is ron hissed as they sat down and slid the doorshut, taking the seats farthest away from the window
	lupin, whispered hermione at once
	how d'you know thatit's on his case, she replied, pointing at the luggage rack over theman's head, where there was a small, battered case held together with alarge quantity of neatly knotted string
	the name professor r
	lupinwas stamped across one corner in peeling letters
	wonder what he teaches said ron, frowning at professor lupin's pallidprofile
	that's obvious, whispered hermione
	there's only one vacancy, isn'tthere defense against the dark arts
	harry, ron, and hermione had already had two defense against the darkarts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year
	there were rumorsthat the job was jinxed
	well, i hope he's up to it, said ron doubtfully
	he looks like on,good hex would finish him off, doesn't he anyway
	what were you going to tell usharry explained all about mr
	weasley's argument and thewarning mr
	weasley had just given him
	when he'd finished, ron lookedthunderstruck, and hermione had her hands over her mouth
	she finallylowered them to say, sirius black escaped to come after you oh,harry
	you'll have to be really, really careful
	don't go looking fortrouble, harry i don't go looking for trouble, said harry, nettled
	trouble usuallyfinds me
	how thick would harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wantsto kill him said ron shakily
	they were taking the news worse than harry had expected
	both ron andhermione seemed to be much more frightened of black than he was
	no one knows how he got out of azkaban, said ron uncomfortably
	noone's ever done it before
	and he was a topsecurity prisoner too
	but they'll catch him, won't they said hermione earnestly
	i mean,they've got all the muggles looking out for him too
	what's thatnoise said ron suddenly
	a faint, tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere
	the, lookedall around the compartment
	it's coming from your trunk, harry, said ron, standing up and reachinginto the luggage rack
	a moment later he had pulled the pocketsneakoscope out from between harry's robes
	it was spinning very fast inthe palm of ron's hand and glowing brilliantly
	is that a sneakoscope said hermione interestedly, standing up for abetter look
	mind you, it's a very cheap one, ron said
	it went haywirejust as i was tying it to errol's leg to send it to harry
	were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time said hermioneshrewdly
	i wasn't supposed to be using errol
	you know he's notreally up to long journeys
	but how else was i supposed to get harry'spresent to himstick it back in the trunk, harry advised as the sneakoscope whistledpiercingly, or it'll wake him up
	he nodded toward professor lupin
	ron stuffed the sneakoscope into aparticularly horrible pair of uncle vernon's old socks, which deadenedthe sound, then closed the lid of the trunk on it
	we could get it checked in hogsmeade, said ron, sitting back down
	they sell that sort of thing in dervish and banges, magical instrumentsand stuff
	fred and george told me
	do you know much about hogsmeade asked hermione keenly
	i've readit's the only entirely nonmuggle settlement in britain yeah, i think it is, said ron in an offhand sort of way
	but that's not why i want to go
	i just want to get inside honeydukes
	what's that said hermione
	it's this sweetshop, said ron, a dreamy look coming over his face,where they've got everything
	pepper imps  they make you smoke atthe mouth  and great fat chocoballs full of strawberry mousse andclotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which you can suck inclass and just look like you're thinking what to write next but hogsmeade's a very interesting place, isn't it hermione pressedon eagerly
	in sites of historical sorcery it says the inn was theheadquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the shrieking shadessupposed to be the most severely haunted building in britain  and massive sherbert balls that make you levitate a few inches offthe ground while you're sucking them, said ron, who was plainly notlistening to a word hermione was saying
	hermione looked around at harry
	won't it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore hogsmeade'spect it will, said harry heavily
	you'll have to tell me whenyou've found out
	what d'you mean said ron
	the dursleys didn't sign my permission form, and fudgewouldn't either
	you're not allowed to come but  no way  mcgonagall or someonewill give you permission   musclely crabbe was taller, with apuddingbowl haircut and a very thick neck goyle had short, bristlyhair and long, gorillaish arms
	well, look who it is, said malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pullingopen the compartment door
	potty and the weasel
	crabbe and goyle chuckled trollishly
	i heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer,weasley, said malfoy
	did your mother die of shockron stood up so quickly he knocked crookshanks's basket to the floor
	professor lupin gave a snort
	who's that said malfoy, taking an automatic step backward as hespotted lupin
	new teacher, said harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he neededto hold ron back
	what were you saying, malfoymalfoy's pale eyes narrowed he wasn't fool enough to pick a fight rightunder a teacher's nose
	c'mon, he muttered resentfully to crabbe and goyle, and theydisappeared
	harry and ron sat down again, ron massaging his knuckles
	i'm not going to take any crap from malfoy this year, he said angrily
	if he makes one more crack about my family, i'm going to gethold of his head and ron made a violent gesture in midair
	ron, hissed hermione, pointing at professor lupin, be careful
	but professor lupin was still fast asleep
	the rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north the windows werenow a solid, shimmering gray, which graduily darkened until lanternsflickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks
	the train rattled, the rain hammered, the ind roared, but still,professor lupin slept
	we must be nearly there, said ron, leaning forward to look pastprofessor lupin at the now completely black window
	the words had hardly left him when the train started to slow down
	great, said ron, getting up and walking carefully past professor lupinto try and see outside
	i want to get to the feast
	we can't be there yet, said hermione, checking her watch
	so why're we stoppingthe train was getting slower and slower
	as the noise of the pistonsfell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against thewindows
	harry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into the corridor
	allalong the carriage, heads were sticking curiously out of theircompartments
	the train came to a stop with a jolt, and distant thuds and bangs toldthem that luggage had fallen out of the racks
	then, without warning,all the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness
	'what's going on said ron's voice from behind harry
	ron, that was my footharry felt his way back to his seat
	d'you think we've broken downdunno
	there was a squeaking sound, and harry saw the dim black outline of ron,wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out
	there's something moving out there, ron said
	i think people arecoming aboard
	the compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully overharry's legs
	sorry  d'you know what's going on  ouch  sorryhullo, neville, said harry, feeling around in the dark and pullingneville up by his cloak
	harry is that you what's happeningno idea  sit down there was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain neville had tried to sit oncrookshanks
	i'm going to go and ask the driver what's going on, came hermione'svoice
	harry felt her pass him, heard the door slide open again, andthen a thud and two loud squeals of pain
	who's thatwho's thatginnyhermionewhat are you doingi was looking for ron  come in and sit down not here said harry hurriedly
	i'm hereouch said neville
	quiet said a hoarse voice suddenly
	professor lupin appeared to have woken up at last
	harry could hearmovements in his corner
	there was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled thecompartment
	professor lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames
	they illuminated his tired, gray face, but his eyes looked alert andwary
	stay where you are, he said in the same hoarse voice, and he gotslowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him
	but the door slid slowly open before lupin could reach it
	standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in lupin'shand, was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling
	its face wascompletely hidden beneath its hood
	harry's eyes darted downward, andwhat he saw made his stomach contract
	there was a hand protruding fromthe cloak and it was glistening, grayish, slimylooking, and scabbed,like something dead that had decayed in water
	but it was visible only for a split second
	as though the creaturebeneath the cloak sensed harry's gaze, the hand was suddenly withdrawninto the folds of its black cloak
	and then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow,rattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more thanair from its surroundings
	an intense cold swept over them all
	harry felt his own breath catch inhis chest
	the cold went deeper than his skin
	it was inside his chest,it was inside his very heart
	harry's eyes rolled up into his head
	he was drowningin cold
	there was a rushing in his ears as though of water
	he wasbeing dragged downward, the roaring growing louder
	and then, from far away, he heard screaming, terrible, terrified,pleading screams
	he wanted to help whoever it was, he tried to move hisarms, but couldn't
	a thick white fog was swirling around him, insidehim harry harry are you all rightsomeone was slapping his face
	w  whatharry opened his eyes there were lanterns above him, and the floor wasshaking  the hogwarts express was moving again and the lights had comeback on
	he seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor
	ron andhermione were kneeling next to him, and above them he could see nevilleand professor lupin watching
	harry felt very sick when he put up hishand to push his glasses back on, he felt cold sweat on his face
	ron and hermione heaved him back onto his seat
	are you okay ron asked nervously
	yeah, said harry, looking quickly toward the door
	the hooded creaturehad vanished
	what happened where's that  that thing who screamedno one screamed, said ron, more nervously still
	harry looked around the bright compartment
	ginny and neville lookedback at him, both very pale
	but i heard screaming a loud snap made them all jump
	professor lupin was breaking an enormousslab of chocolate into pieces
	here, he said to harry, handing him a particularly large piece
	harry took the chocolate but didn't eat it
	what was that thing he asked lupin
	a dementor, said lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone else
	one of the dementors of azkaban
	everyone stared at him
	professor lupin crumpled up the empty chocolatewrapper and put it in his pocket
	i need to speak to the driver, excuseme
	he strolled past harry and disappeared into the corridor
	are you sure you're okay, harry said hermione, watching harryanxiously
	what happened said harry, wiping more sweat offhis face
	well  that thing  the dementor  stood there and looked around imean, i think it did, i couldn't see its face  and you  youi thought you were having a fit or something, said ron, who stilllooked scared
	you went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat andstarted twitching  11and professor lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor,and pulled out his wand, said hermione, and he said, 'none of us ishiding sirius black under our cloaks
	' but the dementor didn't move,so lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand atit, and it turned around and sort of glided away
	it was horrible, said neville, in a higher voice than usual
	did youfeel how cold it got when it came ini felt weird, said ron, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably
	like i'dnever be cheerful again
	ginny, who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as harryfelt, gave a small sob hermione went over and put a comforting armaround her
	but didn't any of you  fall off your seats said harry awkwardly
	no, said ron, looking anxiously at harry again
	ginny was shakinglike mad, though
	harry didn't understand
	he felt weak and shivery, as though he wererecovering from a bad bout of flu he also felt the beginnings of shame
	why had he gone to pieces like that, when no one else hadprofessor lupin had come back
	he paused as he entered, looked around,and said, with a small smile, i haven't poisoned that chocolate, youknow
	harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenlyto the tips of his fingers and toes
	we'll be at hogwarts in ten minutes, said professor lupin
	are youall right, harryharry didn't ask how professor lupin knew his name
	fine, he muttered, embarrassed
	they didn't talk much during the remainder of the journey
	at long last,the train stopped at hogsmeade station, and there was a great scrambleto get outside owls hooted, cats meowed, and neville's pet toad croakedloudly from under his hat
	it was freezing on the tiny platform rainwas driving down in icy sheets
	firs' years this way called a familiar voice
	harry, ron, andhermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of hagrid at the other endof the platform, beckoning the terrifiedlooking new students forwardfor their traditional journey across the lake
	all right, you three hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd
	theywaved at him, but had no chance to speak to him because the mass ofpeople around them was shunting them away along the platform
	harry,ron, and hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform andout onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoachesawaited the remaining students, each pulled, harry could only assume, byan invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door,the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession
	the coach smelled faintly of mold and straw
	harry felt better since thechocolate, but still weak
	ron and hermione kept looking at himsideways, as though frightened he might collapse again
	as the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought irongates, flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars,harry saw two more towering, hooded dementors, standing guard on eitherside
	a wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again he leanedback into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed thegates
	the carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping drive up to thecastle hermione was leaning out of the tiny window, watching the manyturrets and towers draw nearer
	at last, the carriage swayed to a halt,and hermione and ron got out
	as harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in his ear
	you fainted, potter is longbottorn telling the truth you actualyfaintedmalfoy elbowed past hermione to block harry's way up the stone steps tothe castle, his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously
	shove off, malfoy, said ron, whose jaw was clenched
	did you faint as well, weasley said malfoy loudly
	did the scary olddementor frighten you too, weasleyis there a problem said a mild voice
	professor lupin had just gottenout of the next carriage
	malfoy gave professor lupin an insolent stare, which took in the patcheson his robes and the delapidated suitcase
	with a tiny hint of sarcasmin his voice, he said, oh, no  er  professor, then he smirked atcrabbe and goyle and led them up the steps into the castle
	hermione prodded ron in the back to make him hurry, and the three ofthem joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the giant oak frontdoors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit with flamingtorches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upperfloors
	the door into the great hall stood open at the right harry followed thecrowd toward it, but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, whichwas black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called, potter granger iwant to see you bothharry and hermione turned around, surprised
	professor mcgonagall,transfiguration teacher and head of gryffindor house, was calling overthe heads of the crowd
	she was a sternlooking witch who wore her hairin a tight bun her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles
	harryfought his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding professormcgonagall had a way of making him feel he must have done somethingwrong
	there's no need to look so worried  i just want a word in my office,she told them
	move along there, weasley
	ron stared as professor mcgonagall ushered harry and hermione away fromthe chattering crowd they accompanied her across the entrance hall, upthe marble staircase, and along a corridor
	once they were in her office, a small room with a large, welcoming fire,professor mcgonagall motioned harry and hermione to sit down
	shesettled herself behind her desk and said abruptly, professor lupin sentan owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train, potter
	before harry could reply, there was a soft knock on the door and madampomfrey, the nurse, came bustling in
	harry felt himself going red in the face
	it was bad enough that he'dpassed out, or whatever he had done, without everyone making all thisfuss
	i'm fine, he said, i don't need anythingoh, it's you, is it said madam pomfrey, ignoring this and bendingdown to stare closely at him
	i suppose you've been doing somethingdangerous againit was a dementor, poppy, said professor mcgonagall
	they exchanged a dark look, and madam pomfrey clucked disapprovingly
	setting dementors around a school, she muttered, pushing back harry'shair and feeling his forehead
	he won't be the last one who collapses
	terrible things, they are, and the effect theyhave on people who are already delicatei'm not delicate said harry crossly
	of course you're not, said madam pomfrey absentmindedly, now takinghis pulse
	what does he need said professor mcgonagall crisply
	bed restshould he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wingi'm fine said harry, jumping up
	the thought of what draco malfoywould say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture
	well, he should have some chocolate, at the very least, said madampomfrey, who was now trying to peer into harry's eyes
	i've already had some, said harry
	professor lupin gave me some
	hegave it to all of us
	did he, now said madam pomfrey approvingly
	so we've finally got adefense against the dark arts teacher who knows his remediesare you sure you feel all right, potter professor mcgonagall saidsharply
	kindly wait outside while i have a quick word with missgranger about her course schedule, then we can go down to the feasttogether
	harry went back into the corridor with madam pomfrey, who left for thehospital wing, muttering to herself he had to wait only a few minutesthen hermione emerged looking very happy about something, followed byprofessor mcgonagall, and the three of them made their way back down themarble staircase to the great hall
	it was a sea of pointed black hats each of the long house tables waslined with students, their faces glimmering by the light of thousands ofcandles, which were floating over the tables in midair
	professorflitwick, who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair, wascarrying an ancient hat and a threelegged stool out of the hall
	oh, said hermione softly, we've missed the sortingnew students at hogwarts were sorted into houses by trying on thesorting hat, which shouted out the house they were best suited togryffindor, ravenclaw, hufflepuff, or slytherin
	professor mcgonagallstrode off toward her empty seat at the staff table, and harry andhermione set off in the other direction, as quietly as possible, towardthe gryffindor table
	people looked around at them as they passed alongthe back of the hall, and a few of them pointed at harry
	had the storyof his collapsing in front of the dementor traveled that fasthe and hermione sat down on either side of ron, who had saved themseats
	what was all that about he muttered to harry
	harry started to explain in a whisper, but at that moment the headmasterstood up to speak, and he broke off
	professor dumbledore, though very old, always gave an impression ofgreat energy
	he had several feet of long silver hair and beard,halfmoon spectacles, and an extremely crooked nose
	he was oftendescribed as the greatest wizard of the age, but that wasn't why harryrespected him
	you couldn't help trusting albus dumbledore, and as harrywatched him beaming around at the students, he felt really calm for thefirst time since the dementor had entered the train compartment
	welcome said dumbledore, the candlelight shimmering on his beard
	welcome to another year at hogwarts i have a few things to say to youall, and as one of them is very serious, i think it best to get it outof the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast
	dumbledore cleared his throat and continued, as you will all be awareafter their search of the hogwarts express, our school is presentlyplaying host to some of the dementors of azkaban, who are here onministry of magic business
	he paused, and harry remembered what mr
	weasley had said aboutdumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the school
	they are stationed at every entrance to the grounds, dumbledorecontinued, and while they are with us, i must make it plain that nobodyis to leave school without permission
	dementors are not to be fooled bytricks or disguises  or even invisibility cloaks, he added blandly,and harry and ron glanced at each other
	it is not in the nature of adementor to understand pleading or excuses
	i therefore warn each andevery one of you to give them no reason to harm you
	i look to theprefects, and our new head boy and girl, to make sure that no studentruns afoul of the dementors, he said
	percy, who was sitting a few seats down from harry, puffed out his chestagain and stared around impressively
	dumbledore paused again he lookedvery seriously around the hall, and nobody moved or made a sound
	on a happier note, he continued, i am pleased to welcome two newteachers to our ranks this year
	first, professor lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post ofdefense against the dark arts teacher
	there was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic applause
	only those whohad been in the compartment on the train with professor lupin clappedhard, harry among them
	professor lupin looked particularly shabby nextto all the other teachers in their best robes
	look at snape ron hissed in harry's ear
	professor snape, the potions master, was staring along the staff tableat professor lupin
	it was common knowledge that snape ,anted thedefense against the dark arts job, but even harry, who hated snape, wasstartled at the expression twisting his thin, sallow face
	it was beyondanger it was loathing
	harry knew that expression only too well it wasthe look snape wore every time he set eyes on harry
	as to our second new appointment, dumbledore continued as the lukewarmapplause for professor lupin died away
	well, i am sorry to tell youthat professor kettleburn, our care of magical creatures teacher,retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with hisremaining limbs
	however, i am delighted to say that his place will befilled by none other than rubeus hagrid, who has agreed to take on thisteaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties
	harry, ron, and hermione stared at one another, stunned
	then theyjoined in with the applause, which was tumultuous at the gryffindortable in particular
	harry leaned forward to see hagrid, who wasrubyred in the face and staring down at his enormous hands, his widegrin hidden in the tangle of his black beard
	we should've known ron roared, pounding the table
	who else wouldhave assigned us a biting bookharry, ron, and hermione were the last to stop clapping, and asprofessor dumbledore started speaking again, they saw that hagrid waswiping his eyes on the tablecloth
	well, i think that's everything of importance, said dumbledore
	letthe feast beginthe golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food anddrink
	harry, suddenly ravenous, helped himself to everything he couldreach and began to eat
	it was a delicious feast the hall echoed with talk, laughter, and theclatter of knives and forks
	harry, ron, and hermione, however, wereeager for it to finish so that they could talk to hagrid
	they knew howmuch being made a teacher would mean to him
	hagrid wasn't a fullyqualified wizard he had been expelled from hogwarts in his third yearfor a crime he had not committed
	it had been harry, ron, and hermionewho had cleared hagrid's name last year
	at long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from thegolden platters, dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them allto go to bed, and they got their chance
	congratulations, hagrid hermione squealed as they reached theteachers' table
	all down ter you three, said hagrid, wiping his shining face on hisnapkin as he looked up at them
	great man,dumbledore
	came straight down to me hut after professor kettleburnsaid he'd had enough
	it's what i always wanted
	overcome with emotion, he buried his face in his napkin, and professormcgonagall shooed them away
	harry, ron, and hermione joined the gryffindors streaming up the marblestaircase and, very tired now, along more corridors, up more and morestairs, to the hidden entrance to gryffindor tower's large portrait of afat lady in a pink dress asked them, passwordcoming through, coming through percy called from behind the crowd
	the new password's 'fortuna major'oh no, said neville longbottom sadly
	he always had troubleremembering the passwords
	through the portrait hole and across the common room, the girls and boysdivided toward their separate staircases
	harry climbed the spiral stairwith no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back
	theyreached their familiar, circular dormitory with its five fourposterbeds, and harry, looking around, felt he was home at last
	chapter sixtalons and tea leaveswhen harry, ron, and hermione entered the great hall for breakfast thenext day, the first thing they saw was draco malfoy, who seemed to beentertaining a large group of slytherins with a very funny story
	asthey passed, malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit andthere was a roar of laughter
	ignore him, said hermione, who was right behind harry
	just ignorehim, it's not worth it
	hey, potter shrieked pansy parkinson, a slytherin girl with a facelike a pug
	potter the dementors are coming, potter wooooooooooharry dropped into a seat at the gryffindor table, next to georgeweasley
	new thirdyear course schedules, said george, passing then, over
	what's up with you, harrymalfoy, said ron, sitting down on george's other side and glaring overat the slytherin table
	george looked up in time to see malfoy pretending to faint with terroragain
	that little git, he said calmly
	he wasn't so cocky last night whenthe dementors were down at our end of the train
	came runing into ourcompartment, didn't he, frednearly wet himself, said fred, with a contemptuous glance at malfoy
	i wasn't too happy myself, said george
	they're horrible things,those dementors
	sort of freeze your insides, don't they said fred
	you didn't pass out, though, did you said harry in a low voice
	forget it, harry, said george bracingly
	dad had to go out to azkabanone time, remember, fred and he said it was the worst place he'd everbeen, he came back all weak and shaking
	they suck the happiness outof a place, dementors
	most of the prisoners go mad in there
	anyway, we'll see how happy malfoy looks after our first quidditchmatch, said fred
	gryffindor versus slytherin, first game of theseason, rememberthe only time harry and malfoy had faced each other in a quidditchmatch, malfoy had definitely come off worse
	feeling slightly morecheerful, harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes
	hermione was examining her new schedule
	ooh, good, we're starting some new subjects today, she said happily
	villains are these, that trespass upon my private lands come i
	scornat my fall, perchance draw, you knaves, you dogsthey watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword outof its scabbard and began brandishing it violently, hopping up and downin rage
	but the sword was too long for him a particularly wild swingmade him overbalance, and he landed facedown in the grass
	are you all right said harry, moving closer to the picture
	get back, you scurvy braggart back, you roguethe knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up,but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he pulled with allhis might, he couldn't get it out again
	finally, he had to flop backdown onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face
	listen, said harry, taking advantage of the knight's exhaustion,we're looking for the north tower
	you don't know the way, do youa quest the knight's rage seemed to vanish instantly
	he clanked tohis feet and shouted, come follow me, dear friends, and we shall findour goal, or else shall perish bravely in the chargehe gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to mount thefat pony, gave up, and cried, on foot then, good sirs and gentle ladyon onand he ran, clanking loudly, into the left side of the frame and out ofsight
	they hurried after him along the corridor, following the sound of hisarmor
	every now and then they spotted him running through a pictureahead
	be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come yelled the knight, andthey saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women incrinolines, whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase
	puffing loudly, harry, ron, and hermione climbed the tightly spiralingsteps, getting dizzier and dizzier, until at last they heard the murmurof voices above them and knew they had reached the classroom
	farewell cried the knight, popping his head into a painting of somesinisterlooking monks
	farewell, my comradesinarms if ever you haveneed of noble heart and steely sinew, call upon sir cadoganyeah, we'll call you, muttered ron as the knight disappeared, if weever need someone mental
	they climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing, wheremost of the class was already assembled
	there were no doors off thislanding, but ron nudged harry and pointed at the ceiling, where therewas a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it
	'sibyll trelawney, divination teacher,' harry read
	how're wesupposed to get up thereas though in answer to his question, the trapdoor suddenly opened, and asilvery ladder descended right at harry's feet
	after you, said ron, grinning, so harry climbed the ladder first
	he emerged into the strangestlooking classroom he had ever seen
	infact, it didn't look like a classroom at all, more like a cross betweensomeone's attic and an oldfashioned tea shop
	at leasttwenty small,circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintzarmchairs and fat little poufs
	everything was lit with a dim, crimsonlight the curtains at the windows were all closed, and the many lampswere draped with dark red scarves
	it was stiflingly warm, and the firethat was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy,sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle
	the shelvesrunning around the circular walls were crammed with dustylookingfeathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered playing cards,countless silvery crystal balls, and a huge array of teacups
	ron appeared at harry's shoulder as the class assembled around them, alltalking in whispers
	where is she ron said
	a voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of voice
	how nice to see you in the physical world at last
	harry's immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect
	professor trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she wasvery thin her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times theirnatural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl
	innumerablechains and beads hung around her spindly neck, and her arms and handswere encrusted with bangles and rings
	sit, my children, sit, she said, and they all climbed awkwardly intoarmchairs or sank onto poufs
	harry, ron, and hermione sat themselvesaround the same round table
	welcome to divination, said professor trelawney, who had seatedherself in a winged armchair in front of the fire
	my name is professortrelawney
	you may not have seen me before
	i find that descending toooften into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my innereye
	nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement
	professortrelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued, so you havechosen to study divination, the most difficult of all magical arts
	imust warn you at the outset that if you do not have the sight, there isvery little i will be able to teach you
	books can take you only so farin this field
	at these words, both harry and ron glanced, grinning, at hermione, wholooked startled at the news that books wouldn't be much help in thissubject
	many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loudbangs and smells and sudden disappearings, are yet unable to penetratethe veiled mysteries of the future, professor trelawney went on, herenormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face
	it is a giftgranted to few
	you, boy, she said suddenly to neville, who almosttoppled off his pouf
	is your grandmother welli think so, said neville tremulously
	i wouldn't be so sure if i were you, dear, said professor trelawney,the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings
	professor trelawney continued placidly
	we will be covering the basicmethods of divination this year
	the first term will be devoted toreading the tea leaves
	next term we shall progress to palmistry
	by theway, my dear, she shot suddenly at parvati patil, beware a redhairedman
	parvati gave a startled look at ron, who was right behind her and edgedher chair away from him
	in the second term, professor trelawney went on, we shall progress tothe crystal ball  if we have finished with fire omens, that is
	unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in february by a nasty bout offlu
	i myself will lose my voice
	and around easter, one of our numberwill leave us forever
	a very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but professortrelawney seemed unaware of it
	i wonder, dear, she said to lavender brown, who was nearest and shrankback in her chair, if you could pass me the largest silver teapotlavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot from theshelf, and put it down on the table in front of professor trelawney
	incidentally, that thing you are dreading  itwill happen on friday the sixteenth of october
	now, i want you all to divide into pairs
	collect a teacup from theshelf, come to me, and i will fill it
	then sit down and drink, drinkuntil only the dregs remain
	swill these around the cup three times withthe left hand, then turn the cup upside down on its saucer, wait for thelast of the tea to drain away, then give your cup to your partner toread
	you will interpret the patterns using pages five and six ofunfogging the future
	i shall move among you, helping and instructing
	oh, and dear  she caught neville by the arm as he made to stand up after you've broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to selectone of the blue patterned ones i'm rather attached to the pink
	sure enough, neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups whenthere was a tinkle of breaking china
	professor trelawney swept over tohim holding a dustpan and brush and said, one of the blue ones, then,dear, if you wouldn't mind
	when harry and ron had had their teacups filled, they went back to theirtable and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly
	they swilled thedregs around as professor trelawney had instructed, then drained thecups and swapped over
	right, said ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six
	what can you see in minea load of soggy brown stuff, said harry
	the heavily perfumed smoke inthe room was making him feel sleepy and stupid
	broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes to see past themundane professor trelawney cried through the gloom
	harry tried to pull himself together
	right, you've got a crooked sort of cross
	he consulted unfoggingthe future
	that means you're going to have 'trials and suffering' sorry about that  but there's a thing that could be the sun
	that means 'great happiness'
	so you're going to suffer but bevery happy
	you need your inner eye tested, if you ask me, said ron, and they bothhad to stifle their laughs as professor trelawney gazed in theirdirection
	ron peered into harry's teacup, his forehead wrinkled witheffort
	there's a blob a bit like a bowler hat, he said
	maybe you'regoing to work for the ministry of magic
	he turned the teacup the other way up
	but this way it looks more like an acorn
	what's that he scannedhis copy of unfogging the future
	'a windfall, unexpected gold
	'excellent, you can lend me some
	and there's a thin, here, he turnedthe cup again, that looks like an animal
	yeah, if that was itshead
	it looks like a hippo
	professor trelawney whirled around as harry let out a snort of laughter
	let me see that, my dear, she said reprovingly to ron, sweeping overand snatching harry's cup from him
	everyone went quiet to watch
	professor trelawney was staring into the teacup, rotating itcounterclockwise
	my dear, you have a deadly enemy
	but everyone knows that,  said hermione in a loud whisper
	professortrelawney stared at her
	well, they do, said hermione
	everybody knows about harry andyouknowwho
	harry and ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration
	they had never heard hermione speak to a teacher like that before
	professor trelawney chose not to reply
	she lowered her huge eyes toharry's cup again and continued to turn it
	dear, dear, this is not a happy cup
	i thought that was a bowler hat, said ron sheepishly
	danger in your path, my dear
	everyone was staring, transfixed, at professor trelawney, who gave thecup a final turn, gasped, and then screamed
	there was another tinkle of breaking china neville had smashed hissecond cup
	professor trelawney sank into a vacant armchair, herglittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed
	my poor, dear boy no it is kinder not to say
	what is it, professor said dean thomas at once
	everyone had got totheir feet, and slowly they crowded around harry and ron's table,pressing close to professor trelawney's chair to get agood look at harry's cup
	my dear, professor trelawney's huge eyes opened dramatically,you have the grim
	he could tell that he wasn't the only one who didn't understand deanthomas shrugged at him and lavender brown looked puzzled, but nearlyeverybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror
	the grim, my dear, the grim cried professor trelawney, who lookedshocked that harry hadn't understood
	the giant, spectral dog thathaunts churchyards my dear boy, it is an omen  the worst omen  ofdeathharry's stomach lurched
	that dog on the cover of death omens inflourish and blotts the dog in the shadows of magnolia crescent
	lavender brown clapped her hands to her mouth too
	everyone was lookingat harry, everyone except hermione, who had gotten up and moved aroundto the back of professor trelawney's chair
	i don't think it looks like a grim, she said flatly
	professor trelawney surveyed hermione with mounting dislike
	you'll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but i perceive very littleaura around you
	very little receptivity to the resonances of thefuture
	seamus finnigan was tilting his head from side to side
	it looks like a grim if you do this, he said, with his eyes almostshut, but it looks more like a donkey from here, he said, leaning tothe left
	when you've all finished deciding whether i'm going to die or notsaid harry, taking even himself by surprise
	now nobody seemed to wantto look at him
	i think we will leave the lesson here for today, said professortrelawney in her mistiest voice
	please pack away yourthings
	silently the class took their teacups back to professor trelawney,packed away their books, and closed their bags
	even ron was avoidingharry's eyes
	until we meet again, said professor trelawney faintly, fair fortunebe yours
	oh, and dear  she pointed at neville  you'll be latenext time, so mind you work extrahard to catch up
	harry, ron, and hermione descended professor trelawney's ladder and thewinding stair in silence, then set off for professor mcgonagall'stransfiguration lesson
	it took them so long to find her classroom that,early as they had left divination, they were only just in time
	harry chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though hewere sitting in a very bright spotlight the rest of the class keptshooting furtive glances at him, as though he were about to drop dead atany moment
	he hardly heard what professor mcgonagall was telling themabout animagi wizards who could transform at will into animals, andwasn't even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyesinto a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes
	really, what has got into you all today said professor mcgonagall,turning back into herself with a faint pop, and staring around at themall
	not that it matters, but that's the first time my transformation'snot got applause from a class
	everybody's heads turned toward harry again, but nobody spoke
	thenhermione raised her hand
	please, professor, we've just had our first divination class, and wewere reading the tea leaves, and ah, of course, said professor mcgonagall, suddenly frowning
	there is no need to say any more, miss granger
	tell me, which of youwill be dying this yeareveryone stared at her
	me, said harry, finally
	i see, said professor mcgonagall, fixing harry with her beady eyes
	then you should know, potter, that sibyll trelawney has predicted thedeath of one student a year since she arrived at this school
	none ofthem has died yet
	seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting anew class
	if it were not for the fact that i never speak ill of mycolleagues professor mcgonagall broke off, and they saw that her nostrils had gonewhite
	she went on, more calmly, divination is one of the mostimprecise branches of magic
	i shall not conceal from you that i havevery little patience with it
	true seers are very rare, and professortrelawney she stopped again, and then said, in a very matteroffact tone, youlook in excellent health to me, potter, so you will excuse me if i don'tlet you off homework today
	i assure you that if you die, you need nothand it in
	harry felt a bit better
	it was harder to feel scaredof a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddlingperfume of professor trelawney's classroom
	not everyone was convinced,however
	ron still looked worried, and lavender whispered, but whatabout neville's cupwhen the transfiguration class had finished, they joined the crowdthundering toward the great hall for lunch
	ron, cheer up, said hermione, pushing a dish of stew toward him
	youheard what professor mcgonagall said
	ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didn't start
	harry, he said, in a low, serious voice, you haven't seen a greatblack dog anywhere, have youyeah, i have, said harry
	i saw one the night i left the dursleys'
	ron let his fork fall with a clatter
	probably a stray, said hermione calmly
	ron looked at hermione as though she had gone mad
	hermione, if harry's seen a grim, that's  that's bad, he said
	my my uncle bilius saw one and  and he died twentyfour hours latercoincidence, said hermione airily, pouring herself some pumpkin juice
	you don't know what you're talking about said ron, starting to getangry
	grims scare the living daylights out of most wizardsthere you are, then, said hermione in a superior tone
	they see thegrim and die of fright
	the grim's not an omen, it's the cause of deathand harry's still with us because he's not stupid enough to see one andthink, right, well, i'd better kick the bucket thenron mouthed wordlessly at hermione, who opened her bag, took out her newarithmancy book, and propped it open against the juice jug
	i think divination seems very woolly, she said, searching for herpage
	a lot of guesswork, if you ask me
	there was nothing woolly about the grim in that cup said ron hotly
	you didn't seem quite so confident when you were telling harry it was asheep, said hermione coolly
	professor trelawney said you didn't have the right aura you just don'tlike being bad at something for a changehe had touched a nerve
	hermione slammed her arithmancy book down on thetable so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere
	if being good at divination means i have to pretend to see death omensin a lump of tea leaves, i'm not sure i'll be studying it much longerthat lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my arithmancy classshe snatched up her bag and stalked away
	ron frowned after her
	what's she talking about he said to harry
	she hasn't been to anarithmancy class yet
	harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch
	yesterday's rainhad cleared the sky was a clear, pale gray, and the grass was springyand damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever care of magicalcreatures class
	ron and hermione weren't speaking to each other
	harry walked besidethem in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to hagrid's hut onthe edge of the forbidden forest
	it was only when he spotted threeonlytoo familiar backs ahead of them that he realized they must behaving these lessons with the slytherins
	malfoy was talking animatedlyto crabbe and goyle, who were chortling
	harry was quite sure he knewwhat they were talking about
	hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut
	he stood in hismoleskin overcoat, with fang the boarhound at his heels, lookingimpatient to start
	c'mon, now, get a move on he called as the class approached
	got areal treat for yeh today great lesson comin' up everyone here right,follow mefor one nasty moment, harry thought that hagrid was going to lead theminto the forest harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there tolast him a lifetime
	however, hagrid strolled off around the edge of thetrees, and five minutes later, they found themselves outside a kind ofpaddock
	there was nothing in there
	everyone gather 'round the fence here he called
	that's it  makesure yeh can see  now, firs' thing yeh'll want ter do is open yerbooks how said the cold, drawling voice of draco malfoy
	how do we open our books malfoy repeated
	he took out his copy of themonster book of monsters, which he had bound shut with a length of rope
	other people took theirs out too some, like harry, had belted theirbook shut others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped themtogether with binder clips
	hasn'  hasn' anyone bin able ter open their books said hagrid,looking crestfallen
	the class all shook their heads
	yeh've got ter stroke 'em, said hagrid, as though this was the mostobvious thing in the world
	look he took hermione's copy and ripped off the spellotape that bound it
	thebook tried to bite, but hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine,and the book shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand
	oh, how silly we've all been malfoy sneered
	we should have strokedthem why didn't we guessi  i thought they were funny, hagrid said uncertainly to hermione
	oh, tremendously funny said malfoy
	really witty, giving us booksthat try and rip our hands offshut up, malfoy, said harry quietly
	hagrid was looking downcast andharry wanted hagrid's first lesson to be a success
	righ' then, said hagrid, who seemed to have lost his thread, so  soyeh've got yer books an'  an'   now yeh need the magical creatures
	so i'll go an' get 'em
	he strode away from them into the forest and out of sight
	god, this place is going to the dogs, said malfoy loudly
	that oafteaching classes, my father'll have a fit when i tell himshut up, malfoy, harry repeated
	careful, potter, there's a dementor behind youoooooooh squealed lavender brown, pointing toward the opposite sideof the paddock
	trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures harryhad ever seen
	they had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, butthe front legs, wings, and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles, withcruel, steelcolored beaks and large, brilliantly, orange eyes
	thetalons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking
	each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck, which wasattached to a long chain, and the ends of all of these were held in thevast hands of hagrid, who came jogging into the paddock behind thecreatures
	gee up, there he roared, shaking the chains and urging the creaturestoward the fence where the class stood
	everyone drew back slightly ashagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence
	hippogriffs hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them
	beau'iful,aren' theyharry could sort of see what hagrid meant
	once you got over the firstshock of seeing something that was, half horse, half bird, you startedto appreciate the hippogriffs' gleaming coats, changing smoothly fromfeather to hair, each of them a different color stormy gray, bronze,pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black
	so, said hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming around, ifyeh wan' ter come a bit nearer no one seemed to want to
	harry, ron, and hermione, however, approachedthe fence cautiously
	now, firs' thing yeh gotta know abou' hippogriffs is, they're proud,said hagrid
	easily offended, hippogriffs are
	don't never insult one,'cause it might be the last thing yeh do
	malfoy, crabbe, and goyle weren't listening they were talking in anundertone and harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best todisrupt the lesson
	yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs' move, hagridcontinued
	it's polite, see yeh walk toward him, and yeh bow, an' yehwait
	if he bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him
	if he doesn' bow,then get away from him sharpish, 'cause those talons hurt
	right  who wants ter go firstmost of the class backed farther away in answer
	even harry, ron, andhermione had misgivings
	the hippogriffs were tossing their fierce headsand flexing their powerful wings they didn't seem to like beingtethered like this
	no one said hagrid, with a pleading look
	i'll do it, said harry
	there was an intake of breath from behind him, and both lavender andparvati whispered, oooh, no, harry, remember your tea leavesharry ignored them
	he climbed over the paddock fence
	good man, harry roared hagrid
	right then  let's see how yeh geton with buckbeak
	he untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff away from itsfellows, and slipped off its leather collar
	the class on the other sideof the paddock seemed to be holding its breath
	malfoy's eyes werenarrowed maliciously
	easy now, harry, said hagrid quietly
	yeh've got eye contact, nowtry not ter blink
	hippogriffs don' trust yeh if yeh blink toomuch
	harry's eyes immediately began to water, but he didn't shut thern
	buckbeak had turned his great, sharp head and was staring at harry withone fierce orange eye
	tha's it, said hagrid
	harry didn't feel much like exposing the back of his neck to buckbeak,but he did as he was told
	he gave a short bow and then looked up
	the hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him
	ah, said hagrid, sounding worried
	right  back away, now, harry,easy does itbut then, to harry's enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent itsscaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow
	well done, harry said hagrid, ecstatic
	right  yeh can touch himpat his beak, go onfeeling that a better reward would have been to back away, harry movedslowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it
	he patted thebeak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily, as thoughenjoying it
	the class broke into applause, all except for malfoy, crabbe, and goyle,who were looking deeply disappointed
	righ' then, harry, said hagrid
	i reckon he might' let yeh ride himthis was more than harry had bargained for
	he was used to a broomstickbut he wasn't sure a hippogriff would be quite the same
	yeh climb up there, jus' behind the wing joint, said hagrid, an' mindyeh don' pull any of his feathers out, he won' like that
	harry put his foot on the top of buckbeaks wing and hoisted himself ontoits back
	harry wasn't sure where to hold oneverything in front of him was covered with feathers
	go on, then' roared hagrid, slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters
	without warning, twelvefoot wings flapped open on either side of harry,he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he wassoaring upward
	it was nothing like a broomstick, and harry knew whichone he preferred the hippogriff's wings beat uncomfortably on eitherside of him, catching him under his legs and making him feel he wasabout to be thrown off the glossy feathers slipped under his fingersand he didn't dare get a stronger grip instead of the smooth action ofhis nimbus two thousand, he now felt himself rocking backward andforward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with itswings
	buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to theground this was the bit harry had been dreading he leaned back as thesmooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off over the beak,then felt a heavy thud as the four illassorted feet hit the ground
	hejust managed to hold on and push himself straight again
	good work, harry roared hagrid as everyone except malfoy, crabbe, andgoyle cheered
	okay, who else wants a goemboldened by harry's success, the rest of the class climbed cautiouslyinto the paddock
	hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soonpeople were bowing nervously, all over the paddock
	neville ranrepeatedly backward from his, which didn't seem to want to bend itsknees
	ron and hermione practiced on the chestnut, while harry watched
	malfoy, crabbe, and goyle had taken over buckbeak
	he had bowed tomalfoy, who was now patting his beak, looking disdainful
	this is very easy, malfoy drawled, loud enough for harry to, hear him
	i knew it must have been, if potter could do it
	i bet you're notdangerous at all, are you he said to the hippogriff
	are you, yougreat ugly bruteit happened in a flash of steely talons malfoy let out a highpitchedscream and next moment, hagrid was wrestling buckbeak back into hiscollar as he strained to get at malfoy, who lay curled in the grass,blood blossoming over his robes
	i'm dying malfoy yelled as the class panicked
	i'm dying, look atme it's killed meyer not dyin' said hagrid, who had gone very white
	someone help me gotta get him outta here hermione ran to hold open the gate as hagrid lifted malfoy easily
	asthey passed, harry saw that there was a long, deep gash on malfoy's armblood splattered the grass and hagrid ran with him, up the slope towardthe castle
	very shaken, the care of magical creatures class followed at a walk
	theslytherins were all shouting about hagrid
	they should fire him straight away said pansy parkinson, who was intears
	it was malfoy's fault snapped dean thomas
	crabbe and goyle flexedtheir muscles threateningly
	they all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall
	i'm going to see if he's okay said pansy, and they all watched herrun up the marble staircase
	the slytherins, still muttering abouthagrid, headed away in the direction of their dungeon common roomharry, ron, and hermione proceeded upstairs to gryffindor tower
	you think he'll be all right said hermione nervously
	madam pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second, saidharry, who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse
	that was a really bad thing to happen in hagrid's first class, though,wasn't it said ron, looking worried
	trust malfoy to mess things upfor him
	they were among the first to reach the great hall at dinnertime, hopingto see hagrid, but he wasn't there
	they wouldn't fire him, would they said hermione anxiously, nottouching her steakand kidney pudding
	they'd better not, said ron, who wasn't eating either
	harry was watching the slytherin table
	a large group including crabbeand goyle was huddled together, deep in conversation
	harry was surethey were cooking up their own version of how malfoy had been injured
	well, you can't say it wasn't an interesting first day back, said rongloomily
	they went up to the crowded gryffindor common room after dinner andtried to do the homework professor mcgonagall had given them, but allthree of them kept breaking off and glancing out of the tower window
	there's a light on in hagrid's window, harry said suddenly
	ron looked at his watch
	if we hurried, we could go down and see him
	it's still quite early
	i don't know, hermione said slowly, and harry saw her glance at him
	i'm allowed to walk across the grounds,  he said pointedly
	siriusblack hasn't got past the dementors yet, has heso they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole, gladto meet nobody on their way to the front doors, as they weren't entirelysure they were supposed to be out
	the grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight
	whenthey reached hagrid's hut, they knocked, and a voice growled, c'min
	hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table hisboarhound, fang, had his head in hagrid's lap
	one look told them thathagrid had been drinking a lot there was a pewter tankard almost as bigas a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to be having difficultygetting them into focus
	'spect it's a record, he said thickly, when he recognized them
	don'reckon they've ever had a teacher who lasted on'y a day before
	you haven't been fired, hagrid gasped hermione
	not yet, said hagrid miserably, taking a huge gulp of whatever was inthe tankard
	but's only a matter o' time, i' n't it, after malfoy
	how is he said ron as they all sat down
	it wasn't serious, was itmadam pomfrey fixed him best she could, said hagrid dully, but he'ssayin' it's still agony
	he's faking it,  said harry at once
	madam pomfrey can mend anything
	she regrew half my bones last year
	trust malfoy to milk it for all it'sworth
	school gov'nors have bin told, o' course, said hagrid miseribly
	theyreckon i started too big
	shoulda left hippogriffs fer later
	doneflobberworms or summat
	jus' thought itdmake a good firs' lessons allmy fault
	it's all malfoy's fault, hagrid said hermione earnestly
	we're witnesses, said harry
	you said hippogriffs attack if youinsult them
	it's malfoy's problem that he wasn't listening
	we'll telldumbledore what really happened
	yeah, don't worry, hagrid, we'll back you up, said ron
	tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of hagrid's beetleblack eyes
	he grabbed both harry and ron and pulled them into a bonebreaking hug
	i think you've had enough to drink, hagrid, said hermione firmly
	shetook the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it
	at, maybe she's right, said hagrid, letting go of harry and ron, whoboth staggered away, rubbing their ribs
	hagrid heaved himself out ofhis chair and followed hermione unsteadily outside
	they heard a loudsplash
	what's he done said harry nervously as hermione came back in with theempty tankard
	stuck his head in the water barrel, said hermione, putting the tankardaway
	hagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping wet, wiping the waterout of his eyes
	that's better, he said, shaking his head like a dog and drenching themall
	listen, it was good of yeh ter come an' see me, i really hagrid stopped dead, staring at harry as though he'd only just realizedhe was there
	what d'yeh think you're doin', eh he roared, so suddenly that theyjumped a foot in the air
	yeh're not to go wanderin' around after dark,harry an, you two lettin' himhagrid strode over to harry, grabbed his arm, and pulled him to thedoor
	c'mon hagrid said angrily
	i'm takin' yer all back up ter school,an' don' let me catch yeh walkin' down ter see me after dark again
	i'mnot worth thatchapter seventhe boggart in the wardrobemalfoy didn't reappear in classes until late on thursday morning, whenthe slytherins and gryffindors were halfway through double potions
	heswaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in bandages and boundup in a sling, acting, in harry's opinion, as though he were the heroicsurvivor of some dreadful battle
	how is it, draco simpered pansy parkinson
	does it hurt muchyeah, said malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace
	but harry sawhim wink at crabbe and goyle when pansy had looked away
	settle down, settle down, said professor snape idly
	harry and ron scowled at each other snape wouldn't have said settledown if they'd walked in late, he'd have given them detention
	butmalfoy had always been able to get away with anything in snape'sclasses snape was head of slytherin house, and generality favored hisown students above all others
	they were making a new potion today, a shrinking solution
	malfoy set uphis cauldron right next to harry and ron, so that they were preparingtheir ingredients on the same table
	sir, malfoy called, sir, i'll need help cutting up these daisy roots,because of my arm weasley, cut up malfoy's roots for him, said snape without looking up
	there's nothing wrong with your arm, he hissed at malfoy
	malfoy smirked across the table
	weasley, you heard professor snape cut up these roots
	ron seized his knife, pulled malfoy's roots toward him, and began tochop them roughly, so that they were all different sizes
	professor, drawled malfoy, weasley's mutilating my roots, sit
	snape approached their table, stared down his hooked nose at the roots,then gave ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy blackhair
	change roots with malfoy, weasley
	but, sit ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his ownroots into exactly equal pieces
	now, said snape in his most dangerous voice
	ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table a, malfoy,then took up the knife again
	and, sir, i'll need this shrivelfig skinned, said malfoy, his voicefull of malicious laughter
	potter, you can skin malfoy's shrivelfig, said snape, giving harry thelook of loathing he always reserved just for him
	harry took malfoy's shrivelfig as ron began trying to repair the damageto the roots he now had to use
	harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast ashe could and flung it back across the table at malfoy without speaking
	malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever
	seen your pal hagrid lately he asked them quietly
	none of your business, said ron jerkily, without looking up
	i'm afraid he won't be a teacher much longer, said malfoy in a tone ofmock sorrow
	father's not very happy about my injury keep talking, malfoy, and i'll give you a real injury, snarled ron
	he's complained to the school governors
	and to the ministry ofmagic
	father's got a lot of influence, you know
	and a lasting injurylike this  he gave a huge, fake sigh  who knows if my arm'll everbe the same againso that's why you're putting it on, said harry, accidentally beheadinga dead caterpillar because his hand was shaking in anger
	to try to gethagrid fired
	well, said malfoy, lowering his voice to a whisper, partly, potter
	but there are other benefits too
	weasley, slice my caterpillars forme
	a few cauldrons away, neville was in trouble
	neville regularly went topieces in potions lessons it was his worst subject, and his great fearof professor snape made things ten times worse
	his potion, which wassupposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned orange, longbottom, said snape, ladling some up and allowing to splashback into the cauldron, so that everyone could see
	tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull ofyours didn't you hear me say, quite clearly, that only one tat spleenwas needed didn't i state plainly that a dash of leech juice wouldsuffice what do i have to do to make you understand, longbottomneville was pink and trembling
	he looked as though he was on the vergeof tears
	please, sir, said hermione, please, i could help neville put it righti don't remember asking you to show off, miss granger, said snapecoldly, and hermione went as pink as neville
	longbottom, at the end ofthis lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and seewhat happens
	perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly
	snape moved away, leaving neville breathless with fear
	help me he moaned to hermione
	hey, harry, said seamus finnigan, leaning over to borrow harry's brassscales, have you heard daily prophet this morning  they reckonsirius black's been sighted
	where said harry and ron quickly
	on the other side of the table,malfoy looked up, listening closely
	not too far from here, said seamus, who looked excited
	it was amuggle who saw him
	'course, she didn't really understand
	the mugglesthink he's just an ordinary criminal, don't they so she phoned thetelephone hot line
	by the time the ministry of magic got there, he wasgone
	not too far from here
	ron repeated, looking significantly atharry
	he turned around and saw malfoy watching closely
	what, malfoyneed something else skinnedbut malfoy's eyes were shining malevolently, and they were fixed harry
	he leaned across the table
	black singlehanded, potterthinking of trying to catchyeah, that's right, said harry offhandedly
	malfoys thin mouth was curving in a mean smile
	of course, if it was me, he said quietly, i'd have done somethingbefore now
	i wouldn't be staying in school like a good boy, i'd be outthere looking for him
	what are you talking about, malfoy said ron roughly
	don't you know, potter breathed malfoy, his pate eyes narrowed
	know whatmalfoy let out a low, sneering laugh
	maybe you'd rather not risk your neck, he said
	want to leave it tothe dementors, do you but if it was me, i'd want revenge
	i'd hunt himdown myself
	what are you talking about said harry angrily, but at that momentsnape called, you should have finished adding your ingredients by nowthis potion needs to stew before it can be drunk, so clear away while itsimmers and then we'll test longbottom's
	crabbe and goyle laughed openly, watching neville sweat as he stirredhis potion feverishly
	hermione was muttering instructions to him out ofthe corner of her mouth, so that snape wouldn't see
	harry and ronpacked away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands andladles in the stone basin in the corner
	what did malfoy mean harry muttered to ron as he stuck his handsunder the icy jet that poured from the gargoyle's mouth why would iwant revenge on black he hasn't done anything to me  yet
	he's making it up, said ron savagely
	he's trying to make you dosomething stupid
	the end of the lesson in sight, snape strode over to neville, who wascowering by his cauldron
	everyone gather 'round, said snape, his black eyes glittering, andwatch what happens to longbottom's toad
	if he has managed to produce ashrinking solution, it will shrink to a tadpole
	if, as i don't doubt,he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned
	the gryffindors watched fearfully
	the slytherins looked excited
	snapepicked up trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon intoneville's potion, which was now green
	he trickled a few drops downtrevor's throat
	there was a moment of hushed silence, in which trevor gulped then therewas a small pop, and trevor the tadpole was wriggling in snape's palm
	the gryffindors burst into applause
	snape, looking sour, pulled a smallbottle from the pocket of his robe, poured a few drops on top of trevor,and he reappeared suddenly, fully grown
	five points from gryffindor, said snape, which wiped the smiles fromevery face
	i told you not to help him, miss granger
	harry, ron, and hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall
	harrywas still thinking about what malfoy had said, while ron was seethingabout snape
	five points from gryffindor because the potion was all rightwhy didn't you lie, hermione you should've said neville did it all byhimselfhermione didn't answer
	where is sheharry turned too
	they were at the top of the steps now, watching therest of the class pass them, heading for the great hall and lunch
	she was right behind us, said ron, frowning
	malfoy passed them, walking between crabbe and goyle
	he smirked atharry and disappeared
	there she is, said harry
	hermione was panting slightly, hurrying up the stairs one hand clutchedher bag, the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of herrobes
	how did you do that said ron
	what said hermione, joining them
	one minute you were right behind us, the next moment, you were back atthe bottom of the stairs again
	what hermione looked slightly confused
	oh  i had to go back forsomething
	oh no a seam had split on hermione's bag
	harry wasn't surprised he could seethat it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books
	why are you carrying all these around with you ron asked her
	you know how many subjects i'm taking, said hermione breathlessly
	couldn't hold these for me, could youbut  ron was turning over the books she had handed him, looking atthe covers
	you havent got any of these subjects today
	it's onlydefense against the dark arts this afternoon
	oh yes, said hermione vaguely, but she packed all the books back intoher bag just the same
	i hope there's something good for lunch, i'mstarving, she added, and she marched off toward the great hall
	d'you get the feeling hermione's not telling us somethingron askedharry
	professor lupin wasn't there when they arrived at his first defenseagainst the dark arts lesson
	they all sat down, took out their books,quills, and parchment, and were talking when he finally entered theroom
	lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on theteacher's desk
	he was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than hehad on the train, as though he had had a few square meals
	good afternoon, he said
	would you please put all your books back inyour bags
	today's will be a practical lesson
	you will need only yourwands
	a few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books
	they had never had a practical defense against the dark arts before,unless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacherhad brought a cageful of pixies to class and set them loose
	right then, said professor lupin, when everyone was ready
	puzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and followed professorlupin out of the classroom
	he led them along the deserted corridor andaround a corner, where the first thing they saw was peeves thepoltergeist, who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing thenearest keyhole with chewing gum
	peeves didn't look up until professor lupin was two feet away ,hen hewiggled his curlytoed feet and broke into song
	loony, loopy lupin, peeves sang
	loony, loopy lupin, loony, loopylupin rude and unmanageable as he almost always was, peeves usually showedsome respect toward the teachers
	everyone looked quickly at professorlupin to see how he would take this to their surprise, he was stillsmiling
	i'd take that gum out of the keyhole if i were you, peeves, he saidpleasantly
	filch won't be able to get in to his brooms
	filch was the hogwarts caretaker, a badtempered, failed wizard whowaged a constant war against the students and, indeed, peeves
	however,peeves paid no attention to professor lupin's words, except to blow aloud wet raspberry
	professor lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand
	this is a useful little spell, he told the class over his shoulder
	he raised the wand to shoulder height, said, waddiwasi and pointed itat peeves
	with the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum shot out of thekeyhole and straight down peeves's left nostril he whirled upright andzoomed away, cursing
	cool, sit said dean thomas in amazement
	thank you, dean, said professor lupin, putting his wand away again
	shall we proceedthey set off again, the class looking at shabby professor lupin withincreased respect
	he led them down a second corridor and stopped, rightoutside the staffroom door
	inside, please, said professor lupin, opening it and standing back
	the staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old, mismatched chairs, wasempty except for one teacher
	professor snape was sitting in a lowarmchair, and he looked around as the class filed in
	his eyes wereglittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth
	asprofessor lupin came in and made to close the door behind him, snapesaid, leave it open, lupin
	i'd rather not witness this
	he got to his feet and strode past the class, his black robes billowingbehind him
	at the doorway he turned on his heel and said, possibly noone's warned you, lupin, but this class contains neville longbottom
	iwould advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult
	not unlessmiss granger is hissing instructions in his ear
	harry glared at snape it was bad enough that hebullied neville in his own classes, let alone doing it in front of otherteachers
	professor lupin had raised his eyebrows
	i was hoping that neville would assist me with the first stage of theoperation, he said, and i am sure he will perform it admirably
	neville's face went, if possible, even redder
	snape's lip curled, buthe left, shutting the door with a snap
	now, then, said professor lupin, beckoning the class toward the end ofthe room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teacherskept their spare robes
	as professor lupin went to stand next to it, thewardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall
	nothing to worry about, said professor lupin calmly because a fewpeople had jumped backward in alarm
	there's a boggart in there
	most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about
	neville gave professor lupin a look of pure terror, and seamus finniganeyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively
	boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces, said professor lupin
	wardrobes,the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks  i've even met onethat had lodged itself in a grandfather clock
	this one moved inyesterday afternoon, and i asked the headmaster if the staff would leaveit to give my third years some practice
	so, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a boggarthermione put up her hand
	it's a shapeshifter, she said
	it can take the shape of whatever itthinks will frighten us most
	couldn't have put it better myself, said professor lupin, and hermioneglowed
	so the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yetassumed a form
	he does not yet know what will frighten the person onthe other side of the door
	nobody knows what a boggart looks like whenhe is alone, but when i let him out, he will immediately become whatevereach of us most fears
	this means, said professor lupin, choosing to ignore neville's 'mallsputter of terror, that we have a huge advantage over the boggartbefore we begin
	have you spotted it, harrytrying to answer a question with hermione next to him, bobbing up anddown on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air, was veryoffputting, but harry had a go
	er  because there are so many of us, it won't know what shape itshould beprecisely, said professor lupin, and hermione put her hand down,looking a little disappointed
	it's always best to have com pany whenyou're dealing with a boggart
	which should hebecome, a headless corpse or a flesheating slug i once saw a boggartmake that very mistake  tried to frighten two people at once andturned himself into half a slug
	not remotely frightening
	the charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it requires force ofmind
	you see, the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter
	what you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing
	we will practice the charm without wands first
	riddikulusriddikulus said the class together
	good, said professor lupin
	but that was the easy part,i'm afraid
	you see, the word alone is not enough
	and this is where youcome in, neville
	the wardrobe shook again, though not as much as neville, who walkedforward as though he were heading for the gallows
	right, neville, said professor lupin
	first things first what wouldyou say is the thing that frightens you most in the worldneville's lips moved, but no noise came out
	didn't catch that, neville, sorry, said professor lupin cheerfully
	neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to helphim, then said, in barely more than a whisper, professor snape
	nearly everyone laughed
	even neville grinned apologetically
	professorlupin, however, looked thoughtful
	neville, i believe you live with yourgrandmotherer  yes, said neville nervously
	but  i don't want the boggart toturn into her either
	no, no, you misunderstand me, said professor lupin, now smiling
	iwonder, could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usuallywearsneville looked startled, but said, well
	a tallone with a stuffed vulture on top
	and sometimes a foxfur scarf
	and a handbag prompted professor lupin
	a big red one, said neville
	right then, said professor lupin
	can you picture those clothes veryclearly, neville can you see them in your mind's eyeyes, said neville uncertainty, plainly wondering what was coming next
	when the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, neville, and sees you, itwill assume the form of professor snape, said lupin
	and you willraise your wand  thus  and cry 'riddikulus'  and concentrate hardon your grandmother's clothes
	if all goes well, professor boggart snapewill be forced into that vulturetopped hat, and that green dress, withthat big red handbag
	there was a great shout of laughter
	the wardrobe wobbled moreviolently
	if neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift his attentionto each of us in turn, said professor lupin
	i would like all of youto take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most, andimagine how you might force it to look comical
	'what scared him most in theworldhis first thought was lord voldemort  a voldemort returned to fullstrength
	but before he had even started to plan a possiblecounterattack on a boggartvoldemort, a horrible image came floating tothe surface of his mind
	a rotting, glistening hand, slithering back beneath a black cloak
	along, rattling breath from an unseen mouth
	then a cold so penetratingit felt like drowning
	harry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one had noticed
	manypeople had their eyes shut tight
	ron was muttering to himself, takeits legs off  harry was sure he knew what that was about
	ron'sgreatest fear was spiders
	everyone ready said professor lupin
	harry felt a lurch of fear
	how could you make adementor less frightening but he didn't want to ask for more timeeveryone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves
	neville, we're going to back away, said professor lupin
	let you havea clear field, all right i'll call the next person forward
	everyoneback, now, so neville can get a clear shot they all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving neville alonebeside the wardrobe
	he looked pale and frightened, but he had pushed upthe sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand ready
	on the count of three, neville, said professor lupin, who waspointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe
	one two  three nowa jet of sparks shot from the end of professor lupin's wand and hit thedoorknob
	the wardrobe burst open
	hooknosed and menacing, professorsnape stepped out, his eyes flashing at neville
	neville backed away, his wand up, mouthing wordlessly
	snape was bearingdown upon him, reaching inside his robes
	r  r  riddikulus squeaked neville
	there was a noise like a whip crack
	snape stumbled he was wearing along, lacetrimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a motheatenvulture, and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag
	there was a roar of laughter the boggart paused, confused, andprofessor lupin shouted, parvati forwardparvati walked forward, her face set
	snape rounded on her
	there wasanother crack, and where he had stood was a bloodstained, bandagedmummy its sightless face was turned to parvati and it began to walktoward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising riddikulus cried parvati
	a bandage unraveled at the mummy's feet it became entangled, fell faceforward, and its head rolled off
	seamus roared professor lupin
	seamus darted past parvati
	crack where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hairand a skeletal, greentinged face  a banshee
	she opened her mouthwide and an unearthly sound filled the room, a long, wailing shriek thatmade the hair on harry's head stand on end  'riddikulus shoutedseamus
	the banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat her voice wasgone
	crack the banshee turned into a rat, which chased its tail in a circle,then  crack became a rattlesnake, which slithered and writhed before crack  becoming a single, bloody eyeball
	'it's confused shouted lupin
	we're getting there deandean hurried forward
	crack the eyeball became a severed hand, which flipped over and beganto creep along the floor like a crab
	riddikulus yelled dean
	'there was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap
	excellent ron, you nextron leapt forward
	crackquite a few people screamed
	a giant spider, six feet tall and coveredin hair, was advancing on ron, clicking its pincers menacingly
	for amoment, harry thought ron had frozen
	then riddikulus bellowed ron, and the spider's legs vanished it rolledover and over lavender brown squealed and ran out of its way and itcame to a halt at harry's feet
	he raised his wand, ready, but here shouted professor lupin suddenly, hurrying forward
	crackthe legless spider had vanished
	for a second, everyone looked wildlyaround to see where it was
	then they saw a silverywhite orb hanging inthe air in front of lupin, who said, riddikulus almosi lazily
	crackforward, neville, and finish him off said lupin as the boggart landedon the floor as a cockroach
	crack snape was back
	this time nevillecharged forward looking determined
	riddikulus he shouted, and they had a split second's view of snape inhis lacy dress before neville let out a great ha of laughter, and theboggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke, and wasgone
	excellent cried professor lupin as the class broke into applause
	five pointsto gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart  ten for nevillebecause he did it twice
	and five each to hermione and harry
	but i didn't do anything, said harry
	you and hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of theclass, harry, lupin said lightly
	very well, everyone, an excellentlesson
	homework, kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize itfor me
	to be handed in on monday
	talking excitedly, the class left the staffroom
	harry, however, wasn'tfeeling cheerful
	professor lupin had deliberately stopped him fromtackling the boggart
	why was it because he'd seen harry collapse onthe train, and thought he wasn't up to much had he thought harry wouldpass out againbut no one else seemed to have noticed anything
	did you see me take that banshee shouted seamus
	and the hand saiddean, waving his own around
	and snape in that hat and my mummyi wonder why professor lupin's frightened of crystal balls saidlavender thoughtfully
	that was the best defense against the dark arts lesson we've ever had,wasn't it said ron excitedly as they made their way back to theclassroom to get their bags
	he seems like a very good teacher, said hermione approvingly
	but iwish i could have had a turn with the boggart what would it have been for you said ron, sniggering
	a piece ofhomework that only got nine out of tenchapter eightflight of the fat fadyin no time at all, defense against the dark arts had become mostpeople's favorite class
	only draco malfoy and his gang of slytherinshad anything bad to say about professor lupin
	look at the state of his robes, malfoy would say in a loud whisper asprofessor lupin passed
	he dresses like our old houseelf but no one else cared that professor lupin's robes were patched andfrayed
	his next few lessons were just as interesting as the first
	after boggarts, they studied red caps, nasty little goblin likecreatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed in the dungeonsof castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting tobludgeon those who had gotten lost
	from red caps they moved on tokappas, creepy
	waterdwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, withwebbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds
	harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes
	worstof all was potions
	snape was in a particularly vindictive mood thesedays, and no one was in any doubt why
	the story of the boggart assumingsnape's shape, and the way that neville had dressed it in hisgrandmother's clothes, had traveled through the school like wildfire
	snape didn't seem to find it funny
	his eyes flashed menacingly at thevery mention of professor lupin's name, and he was bullying nevilleworse than ever
	harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in professortrelawney's stifling tower room, deciphering lopsided shapes andsymbols, trying to ignore the way professor trelawney's enormous eyesfilled with tears every time she looked at him
	he couldn't likeprofesser trelawney, even though she was treated with respect borderingon reverence by many of the class
	parvati patil and lavender brown hadtaken to haunting professor trelawney's tower room at lunch times, andalways returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces, as thoughthey knew things the others didn't
	they had also started using hushedvoices whenever they spoke to harry, as though he were on his deathbed
	nobody really liked care of magical creatures, which, after theactionpacked first class, had become extremely dull
	hagrid seemed tohave lost his confidence
	they were now spending lesson after lessonlearning how to look after flobberworms, which had to be some of themost boring creatures in existence
	why would anyone bother looking after them said ron, after yetanother hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms' throats
	at the start of october, however, harry had something else to occupyhim, something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactoryclasses
	the quidditch season was approaching, and o1iver wood, captainof the gryffindor team, called a meeting on thursday evening to discusstactics for the new season
	there were seven people on a quidditch team three chasers, whose job itwas to score goals by putting the quaffle a red, soccersized ballthrough one of the fiftyfoothigh hoops at eachend of the field two beaters, who were equipped with heavy bats torepel the bludgers two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying toattack the players a keeper, who defended the goalposts, and the seeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catchingthe golden snitch, a tiny, winged, walnutsized ball, whose captureended the game and earned the seeker's team an extra one hundred andfifty points
	oliver wood was a burly seventeenyearold, now in his seventh and finalyear at hogwarts
	there was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice a'she addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms onthe edge of the darkening quidditch field
	this is our last chance  my last chance  to win the quidditch cup,he told them, striding up and down in front of them
	i'll be leaving atthe end of this year
	i'll never get another shot at it
	gryffindor hasn't won for seven years now
	okay, so we've had the worstluck in the world  injuries  then the tournamentgetting called offlast year wood swallowed, as though the memory still brought a lump tohis throat
	but we also know we've got thebestruddyteamintheschool, he said, punching a fist into his otherhand, the old manic glint back in his eye
	we've got three superbchasers
	wood pointed at alicia spinner, angelina johnson, and katie bell
	we've got two unbeatable beaters
	stop it, oliver, you're embarrassing us, said fred and george weasleytogether, pretending to blush
	and we've got a seeker who has never failed to win us a match woodrumbled, glaring at harry with a kind of furious pride
	and me, headded as an afterthought
	we think you're very good too, oliver, said george
	spanking good keeper, said fred
	the point is, wood went on, resuming his pacing, the quidditch cupshould have had our name on it these last two years
	ever since harryjoined the team, i've thought the thing was in the bag
	but we haven'tgot it, and this year's the last chance we'll get to finally see ourname on the thing
	wood spoke so dejectedly that even fred and george looked sympathetic
	oliver, this year's our year, said fred
	we'll do it, oliver said angelina
	definitely, said harry
	full of determination, the team started training sessions, threeevenings a week
	the weather was getting colder and wetter, the nightsdarker, but no amount of mud, wind, or rain could tarnish harry'swonderful vision of finally winning the huge, silver quidditch cup
	harry returned to the gryffindor common room one evening after training,cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone, to find theroom buzzing excitedly
	what's happened, he asked ron and hermione, who were sitting in twoof the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts forastronomy
	first hogsmeade weekend, said ron, pointing at a notice that hadappeared on the battered old bulletin board
	excellent, said fred, who had followed harry through the portraithole
	i need to visit zonko's
	i'm nearly out of stink pellets
	harry threw himself into a chair beside ron, his high spirits ebbingaway
	hermione seemed to read his mind
	harry, i'm sure you'll be able to go next time, she said
	they'rebound to catch black soon
	he's been sighted once already
	black's not fool enough to try anything in hogsmeade, said ron
	askmcgonagall if you can go this time, harry
	the next one might not be forages ron said hermione
	harry's supposed to stay in schoolhe can't be the only third year left behind, said ron
	askmcgonagall, go on, harry yeah, i think i will, said harry, making up his mind
	hermione opened her mouth to argue, but at that moment crookshanks leaptlightly onto her lap
	a large, dead spider was dangling from his mouth
	does he have to eat that in front of us said ron, scowling
	clever crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself said hermione
	crookshanks slowly chewed up the spider, his yellow eyes fixedinsolently on ron
	just keep him over there, that's all, said ron irritably, turning backto his star chart
	1've got scabbers asleep in my bag
	he really wanted to go to bed, but he still had his ownstar chart to complete
	he pulled his bag toward him, took outparchment, ink, and quill, and started work
	you can copy mine, if you like, said ron, labeling his last star witha flourish and shoving the chart toward harry
	hermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her lips but didn't sayanything
	crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at ron, flickingthe end of his bushy tail
	then, without warning, he pounced
	oy ron roared, seizing his bag as crookshanks sank four sets of clawsdeep inside it and began tearing ferociously
	get off, you stupidanimalron tried to pull the bag away from crookshanks, but crookshanks clungon, spitting and slashing
	ron, don't hurt him squealed hermione the whole common room waswatching ron whirled the bag around, crookshanks still clinging to it,and scabbers came flying out of the top catch that car' ron yelled as crookshanks freed himself from theremnants of the bag, sprang over the table, and chased after theterrified scabbers
	george weasley made a lunge for crookshanks but missed scabbersstreaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest ofdrawers
	crookshanks skidded to a halt, crouched low on his bandy legs,and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw
	ron and hermione hurried over hermione grabbed crookshanks around themiddle and heaved him away ron threw himself onto his stomach and, withgreat difficulty, pulled scabbers out by the tail
	look at him he said furiously to hermione, dangling scabbers in frontof her
	he's skin and bone you keep that cat away from himcrookshanks doesn't understand it's wrong said hermione, her voiceshaking
	all cats chase rats, ronthere's something funny about that animal said ron, who was trying topersuade a frantically wiggling scabbers back into his pocket
	it heardme say that scabbers was in my bagoh, what rubbish, said hermione impatiently
	crookshanks could smellhim, ron, how else d'you think that cat's got it in for scabbers said ron, 'ignoring the peoplearound him, who were starting to giggle
	and scabbers was here first,and he's illron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs tothe boys' dormitories
	ron was still in a bad mood with hermione next day
	he barely talked toher all through herbology, even though he, harry, and hermione wereworking together on the same puffapod
	how's scabbers hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink podsfrom the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail
	he's hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking,  said ron angrily,missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor
	careful, weasley, careful cried professor sprout as the beans burstinto bloom before their very eyes
	they had transfiguration next
	harry, who had resolved to ask professormcgonagall after the lesson whether he could go into hogsmeade with therest, joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he wasgoing to argue his case
	he was distracted, however, by a disturbance atthe front of the line
	lavender brown seemed to be crying
	parvati had her arm around her andwas explaining something to seamus finnigan and dean thomas, who werelooking very serious
	what's the matter, lavender said hermione anxiously as she, harry,and ron went to join the group
	she got a letter from home this morning, parvati whispered
	it's herrabbit, binky
	he's been killed by a fox
	oh, said hermione, i'm sorry, lavender
	i should have known said lavender tragically
	you know what day itiser the sixteenth of october 'that thing you're dreading, it will happenon the sixteenth of october' remember she was right, she was rightthe whole class was gathered around lavender now
	seamus shook his headseriously
	hermione hesitated then she said, you  you were dreadingbinky being killed by a foxwell, not necessarily by a fox, said lavender, looking up at hermionewith streaming eyes, but i was obviously dreading him dying, wasn't loh, said hermione
	thenwas binky an old rabbitn  no sobbed lavender
	h  he was only a babyparvati tightened her arm around lavender's shoulders
	but then, why would you dread him dying said hermione
	parvati glared at her
	well, look at it logically, said hermione, turning to the rest of thegroup i mean, binky didn't even die today, did he lavender just gotthe news today lavender wailed loudly
	and she can't have beendreading it, because it's come as a real shock don't mind hermione, lavender, said ron loudly, she doesn't thinkother people's pets matter very much
	professor mcgonagall opened the classroom door at that moment, which wasperhaps lucky hermione and ron were looking daggers at each other, andwhen they got into class, they seated themselves on either side of harryand didn't talk to each other for the whole class
	harry still hadn't decided what he was going to say to professormcgonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was shewho brought up the subject of hogsmeade first
	one moment, please  she called as the class made to leave
	as you'reall in my house, you should hand hogsmeade permission forms to me beforehalloween
	no form, no visiting the village, so don't forgetneville put up his hand
	please, professor, i  i think i've lostyour grandmother sent yours to me directly, longbottom, said professormcgonagall
	she seemed to think it was safer
	well, that's all, you mayleave
	ask her now, ron hissed at harry
	go for it, harry, said ron stubbornly
	harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear, then headednervously for professor mcgonagall's desk
	yes, potter harry took a deep breath
	professor, my aunt and uncle  er  forgot to sign my form, he said
	professor mcgonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but didn'tsay anything
	so  er d'you think it would be all right mean, will it be okay if i if i go to hogsmeadeprofessor mcgonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her desk
	i'm afraid not, potter, she said
	you heard what i said
	no form, novisiting the village
	but  professor, my aunt and uncle  you know, they're muggles, theydon't really understand about  about hogwarts forms and stuff, harrysaid, while ron egged him on with vigorous nods
	if you said i could gobut i don't say so, said professor mcgonagall, standing up and pilingher papers neatly into a drawer
	the form clearly states that theparent or guardian must give permission
	she turned to look at him,with an odd expression on her face
	was it pity i'm sorry, potter, butthat's my final word
	you had better hurry, or you'll be late for yournext lesson
	there was nothing to be done
	ron called professor mcgonagall a lot ofnames that greatly annoyed hermione hermione assumed anallforthebest expression that made ron even angrier, and harry hadto endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about whatthey were going to do first, once they got into hogsmeade
	there's always the feast, said ron, in an effort to cheer harry up
	you know, the halloween feast, in the evening
	yeah, said harry gloomily, great
	the halloween feast was always good, but it would taste a lot better ifhe was coming to it after a day in hogsmeade with everyone else
	nothinganyone said made him feel any better about being left behind
	deanthomas, who was good with a quill, had offered to forge uncle vernon'ssignature on the form, but as harry had already told professormcgonagall he hadn't had it signed, that was no good
	ron halfheartedlysuggested the invisibility cloak, but hermione stamped on that one,reminding ron what dumbledore had told them about the dementors beingable to see through them
	percy had what were possibly the least helpfulwords of comfort
	they make a fuss about hogsmeade, but i assure you, harry, it's not allit's cracked up to be, he said seriously
	all right, the sweetshop'srather good, and zonko's joke shop's frankly dangerous, and yes, theshrieking shack's always worth a visit, but really, harry, apart fromthat, you're not missing anything
	on halloween morning, harry awoke with the rest and went down tobreakfast, feeling thoroughly depressed, though doing his best to actnormally
	lots of sweets back from honeydukes, said hermione,looking desperately sorry for him
	yeah, loads, said ron
	he and hermione had finally forgotten theirsquabble about crookshanks in the face of harry's difficulties
	don't worry about me, said harry, in what he hoped was at, offhandvoice, i'll see you at the feast
	he accompanied them to the entrance hall, where filch, the caretaker,was standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a longlist, peering suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no onewas sneaking out who shouldn't be going
	staying here, potter shouted malfoy, who was standing in line withcrabbe and goyle
	scared of passing the dementorsharry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase,through the deserted corridors, and back to gryffindor tower
	password said the fat lady, jerking out of a doze
	fortuna major, said harry listlessly
	the portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the commonroom
	it was full of chattering first and second years, and a few olderstudents, who had obviously visited hogsmeade so often the novelty hadworn offharry harry hi, harryit was colin creevey, a second year who was deeply in awe of harry andnever missed an opportunity to speak to him
	aren't you going to hogsmeade, harry why not hey  colin lookedeagerly around at his friends  you can come and sit with us, if youlike, harryer  no, thanks, colin, said harry, who wasn't in the mood to have alot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead
	i  i've gotto go to the library, got to get some work done
	after that, he had no choice but to turn right around and head back outof the portrait hole again
	what was the point waking me up the fat lady called grumpily afterhim as he walked away
	harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library, but halfway there hechanged his mind he didn't feel like working
	he turned around and camefacetoface with filch, who had obviously just seen off the last of thehogsmeade visitors
	what are you doing filch snarled suspiciously
	nothing, said harry truthfully
	nothing spat filch, his jowls quivering unpleasantly
	a likelystory sneaking around on your own  why aren't you in hogsmeade buyingstink pellets and belch powder and whizzing worms like the rest of yournasty little friendsharry shrugged
	well, get back to your common room where you belong snapped filch,and he stood glaring until harry had passed out of sight
	but harry didn't go back to the common room he climbed a staircase,thinking vaguely of visiting the owlery to see hedwig, and was walkingalong another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said,harryharry doubled back to see who had spoken and met professor lupin,looking around his office door
	what are you doing said lupin, though in a very different voice fromfilch
	where are ron and hermionehogsmeade, said harry, in a wouldbe casual voice
	he considered harry for a moment
	why don't you comein i've just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson
	ihe followed lupin into his office
	in the corner stood a very large tankof water
	a sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its facepressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindlyfingers
	water demon, said lupin, surveying the grindylow thoughtfully
	weshouldn't have much difficulty with him, not after the kappas
	the trickis to break his grip
	you notice the abnormally long fingers strong,but very brittle
	the grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangleof weeds in a corner
	cup of tea lupin said, looking around for his kettle
	i was justthinking of making one
	all right, said harry awkwardly
	lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issuedsuddenly from the spout
	sit down, said lupin, taking the lid off a dusty tin
	i've only gotteabags, i'm afraid  but i daresay you've had enough of tea leavesharry looked at him
	lupin's eyes were twinkling
	how did you know about that harry asked
	professor mcgonagall told me, said lupin, passing harry a chipped mugof tea
	you're not worried, are youno, said harry
	he thought for a moment of telling lupin about the dog he'd seen inmagnolia crescent but decided not to
	he didn't want lupin to think hewas a coward, especially since lupin alreadv seemed to think he couldn'tcope with a boggart
	something of harry's thoughts seemed to have shown on his face, becauselupin said, anything worrying you, harryno, harry lied
	he drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylowbrandishing a fist at him
	yes, he said suddenly, putting his tea downon lupin's desk
	you know that day we fought the boggartyes, said lupin slowly
	why didn't you let me fight it said harry abruptly
	lupin raised his eyebrows
	i would have thought that was obvious, harry, he said, soundingsurprised
	harry, who had expected lupin to deny that he'd done any such thing, wastaken aback
	well, said lupin, frowning slightly, i assumed that if the boggartfaced you, it would assume the shape of lord voldemort
	not only was this the last answer he'd expected, but lupinhad said voldemort's name
	the only person harry had ever heard say thename aloud apart from himself was professor dumbledore
	clearly, i was wrong, said lupin, still frowning at harry
	but ididn't think it a good idea for lord voldemort to materialize in thestaffroom
	i imagined that people would panic
	i didn't think of voldemort, said harry honestly
	i  i rememberedthose dementors
	i see, said lupin thoughtfully
	fiesmiled slightly at the look of surprise on harry's face
	that suggeststhat what you fear most of all is  fear
	harry didn't know what to say to that, so he drank some mot,, tea
	so you've been thinking that i didn't believe you capable of fightingthe boggart said lupin shrewdly
	he was suddenly feeling a lot happier
	professor lupin, you know the dementors he was interrupted by a knock on the door
	come in, called lupin
	the door opened, and in came snape
	he was carrying a goblet, which wassmoking faintly, and stopped at the sight of harry, his black eyesnarrowing
	ah, severus, said lupin, smiling
	could you leaveit here on the desk for mesnape set down the smoking goblet, his eyes wandering between harry andlupin
	i was just showing harry my grindylow, said lupin pleasantly, pointingat the tank
	fascinating, said snape, without looking at it
	you should drink thatdirectly, lupin
	yes, yes, i will, said lupin
	i made an entire cauldronful, snape continued
	i should probably take some again tomorrow
	thanks very much, severus
	not at all, said snape, but there was a look in his eye harry didn'tlike
	he backed out of the room, unsmiling and watchful
	harry looked curiously at the goblet
	professor snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me, he said
	ihave never been much of a potionbrewer and this one is particularlycomplex
	he picked up the goblet and sniffed it
	pity sugar makes ituseless, he added, taking a sip and shuddering
	lupin looked at him and answered the unfinishedquestion
	i've been feeling a bit offcolor, he said
	this potion is the onlything that helps
	i am very lucky to be working alongside professorsnape there aren't many wizards who are up to making it
	professor lupin took another sip and harry had a crazy urge to knock thegoblet out of his hands
	professor snape's very interested in the dark arts, he blurted out
	really said lupin, looking only mildly interested as he took anothergulp of potion
	some people reckon  harry hesitated, then plunged recklessly on,some people reckon he'd do anything to get the defense against the darkarts job
	lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face
	well, harry, i'd better get back to work
	seeyou at the feast later
	right, said harry, putting down his empty teacup
	the empty goblet was still smoking
	there you go, said ron
	we got as much as we could carry
	a shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into harry's lap
	it wasdusk, and ron and hermione had just turned up in the common room,pinkfaced from the cold wind and looking as though they'd had the timeof their lives
	thanks, said harry, picking up a packet of tiny black pepper imps
	what's hogsmeade like where did you goby the sound of it  everywhere
	dervish and banges, the wizardingequipment shop, zonko's joke shop, into the three broomsticks forfoaming mugs of hot butterbeer, and many places besides
	the post office, harry about two hundred owls, all sitting on shelves,all colorcoded depending on how fast you want your letter to gettherehoneydukes has got a new kind of fudge they were giving out freesamples, there's a bit, look we think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts at the threebroomsticks wish we could have brought you some butterbeer, really warms you up what did you do said hermione, looking anxious
	did you get any workdoneno, said harry
	lupin made me a cup of tea in his office
	and thensnape came in
	he told them all about the goblet
	ron's mouth fell open
	lupin drank it he gasped
	is he madhermione checked her watch
	we'd better go down, you know, the feast'll be starting in fiveminutesthey hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd, stilldiscussing snape
	but if he  you know  hermione dropped her voice, glancingnervously around  if he was trying to to poison lupin  he wouldn'thave done it in front of harry
	yeah, maybe, said harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossedinto the great hall
	it had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds ofcandlefilled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live bats, and manyflaming orange streamers, which were swimming lazily across the stormyceiling like brilliant watersnakes
	the food was delicious even hermione and ron, who were full to burstingwith honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything
	harrykept glancing at the staff table
	professor lupinlooked cheerful and as well as he ever did he was talking animatedly totiny little professor flitwick, the charms teacher
	harry moved his eyesalong the table, to the place where snape sat
	was he imagining it, orwere snape's eyes flickering toward lupin more often than was naturalthe feast finished with an entertainment provided by the hogwartsghosts
	they popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formationgliding nearly headless nick, the gryffindor ghost, had a great successwith a reenactment of his own botched beheading
	it had been such a pleasant evening that harry's good mood couldn't evenbe spoiled by malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left thehall, the dementors send their love, potterharry, ron, and hermione followed the rest of the gryffindors along theusual path to gryffindor tower, but when they reached the corridor thatended with the portrait of the fat lady, they found it jammed withstudents
	why isn't anyone going in said ron curiously
	harry peered over the heads in front of him
	the portrait seemed to beclosed
	let me through, please, came percy's voice, and he came bustlingimportantly through the crowd
	what's the holdup here you can't allhave forgotten the password  excuse me, i'm head boy and then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that achill seemed to spread down the corridor
	they heard percy say, in asuddenly sharp voice, somebody get professor dumbledore
	people's heads turned those at the back were standing on tiptoe
	what's going on said ginny, who had just arrived
	a moment later, professor dumbledore was there, sweeping toward theportrait the gryffindors squeezed together to let him through, andharry, ron, and hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was
	oh, my  hermione grabbed harry's arm
	the fat lady had vanished from her portrait, which had been slashed soviciously that strips of canvas littered the floor great chunks of ithad been torn away completely
	dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned, hiseyes somber, to see professors mcgonagall, lupin, and snape hurryingtoward him
	we need to find her, said dumbledore
	professor mcgonagall, please goto mr
	filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castlefor the fat lady
	you'll be lucky said a cackling voice
	it was peeves the poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd and lookingdelighted, as he always did, at the sight of wreckage or worry
	what do you mean, peeves said dumbledore calmly, and peeves's grinfaded a little
	he didn't dare taunt dumbledore
	instead he adopted anoily voice that was no better than his cackle
	ashamed, your headship,sit
	doesn't want to be seen
	she's a horrible mess
	saw her runningthrough the landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging between thetrees
	crying something dreadful, he said happily
	poor thing, headded unconvincingly
	did she say who did it said dumbledore quietly
	oh yes, professorhead, said peeves, with the air of one cradling alarge bombshell in his arms
	he got very angry when she wouldn't lethim in, you see
	peeves flipped over and grinned at dumbledore frombetween his own legs
	nasty temper he's got, that sirius black
	chapter ninegrim defeatprofessor dumbledore sent all the gryffindors back to the great hall,where they were joined ten minutes later by the students fromhufflepuff, ravenclaw, and slytherin, who all looked extremely confused
	the teachers and i need to conduct a thorough search of the castle,professor dumbledore told them as professors mcgonagall and flitwickclosed all doors into the hall
	i'm afraid that, for your own safety,you will have to spend the night here
	i want the prefects to standguard over the entrances to the hall and i am leaving the head boy andgirl in charge
	any disturbance should be reported to me immediately,he added to percy, who was looking immensely proud and important
	sendword with one of the ghosts
	professor dumbledore paused, about to leave the hall, and said, oh,yes, you'll be needing
	one casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of thehall and stood themselves against the walls another wave, and the floorwas covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags
	sleep well, said professor dumbledore, closing the door behind him
	the hall immediately began to buzz excitedly the gryffindors weretelling the rest of the school what had just happened
	everyone into their sleeping bags shouted percy
	come on, now, nomore talking lights out in ten minutesc'mon, ron said to harry and hermione they seized three sleeping bagsand dragged them into a corner
	do you think black's still in the castle hermione whisperedanxiously
	dumbledore obviously thinks he might be, said ron
	it's very lucky he picked tonight, you know, said hermione as theyclimbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves ontheir elbows to talk
	the one night we weren't in the tower
	i reckon he's lost track of time, being on the run, said ron
	didn'trealize it was halloween
	otherwise he'd have come bursting in here
	all around them, people were asking one another the same question howdid he get inmaybe he knows how to apparate, said a ravenclaw a few feet away,just appear out of thin air, you know
	disguised himself, probably, said a hufflepuff fifth year
	hecould've flown in, suggested dean thomas
	honestly, am i the only person who's ever bothered to read hogwarts, ahistory said hermione crossly to harry and ron
	whybecause the castle's protected by more than walls, you know,,, saidhermione
	there are all sorts of enchantments on it, to stop peopleentering by stealth
	you can't just apparate in here
	and i'd like tosee the disguise that could fool those dementors
	they're guarding everysingle entrance to the grounds
	they'd have seen him fly in too
	andfitch knows all the secret passages, they'll have them covered
	the lights are going out now percy shouted
	i want everyone in theirsleeping bags and no more talkingthe candles all went out at once
	the only light now came from thesilvery ghosts, who were drifting about talking seriously to theprefects, and the enchanted ceiling, which, like the sky outside, wasscattered with stars
	what with that, and the whispering that stillfilled the hall, harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in alight wind
	once every hour, a teacher would reappear in the hall to check thateverything was quiet
	around three in the morning, when many studentshad finally fallen asleep, professor dumbledore came in
	harry watchedhim looking around for percy, who had been prowling between the sleepingbags, telling people off for talking
	percy was only a short way awayfrom harry, ron, and hermlone, who quickly pretended to be asleep asdumbledore's footsteps drew nearer
	any sign of him, professor asked percy in a whisper
	all well hereeverything under control, sir
	there's no point moving them all now
	i've found a temporaryguardian for the gryffindor portrait hole
	you'll be able to move themback in tomorrow
	and the fat lady, sirhiding in a map of argyllshire on the second floor
	apparently sherefused to let black in without the password, so he attacked
	she'sstill very distressed, but once she's calmed down, i'll have mr
	harry heard the door of the hall creak open again, and more footsteps
	headmaster it was snape
	harry kept quite still, listening hard
	thewhole of the third floor has been searched
	and filchhas done the dungeons nothing there either
	what about the astronomy tower professor trelawney's room theowleryall searched
	i didn't really expect black to linger
	have you any theory as to how he got in, professor asked snape
	harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear,many, severus, each of them as unlikely as the next
	harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stooddumbledore's back was to him, but he could see percy's face, rapt withattention, and snape's profile, which looked angry
	you remember the conversation we had, headmaster, just before  ah the start of term said snape, who was barely opening his lips, asthough trying to block percy out of the conversation
	i do, severus, said dumbledore, and there was something like warningin his voice
	it seems  almost impossible  that black could have entered theschool without inside help
	i did express my concerns whet, youappointed i do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helpedblack enter it, said dumbledore, and his tone made it so clear that thesubject was closed that snape didn't reply
	i must go down to thedementors, said dumbledore
	i said i would inform them when our searchwas complete
	didn't they want to help, sit said percy
	oh yes, said dumbledore coldly
	but i'm afraid no dementor will crossthe threshold of this castle while i am headmaster
	percy looked slightly abashed
	dumbledore left the hall, walking quicklyand quietly
	snape stood for a moment, watching the headmaster with anexpression of deep resentment on his face then he too left
	harry glanced sideways at ron and hermione
	both of them had their eyesopen too, reflecting the starry ceiling
	what was all that about ron mouthed
	the school talked of nothing but sirius black for the next few days
	thetheories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilderhannah abbott, from hufflepuff, spent much of their next herbology classtelling anyone who'd listen that black could turn into a floweringshrub
	the fat lady's ripped canvas had been taken off the wall andreplaced with the portrait of sir cadogan and his fat gray pony
	nobodywas very happy about this
	sir cadogan spent half his time challengingpeople to duels, and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicatedpasswords, which he changed at least twice a day
	he's a complete lunatic, said seamus finnigan angrily to percy
	can'twe get anyone elsenone of the other pictures wanted the job, said percy
	frightened ofwhat happened to the fat lady
	sir cadogan was the only one brave enoughto volunteer
	sir cadogan, however, was the least of harry's worries
	he was now beingclosely watched
	teachers found excuses to walk along corridors withhim, and percy weasley acting, harry suspected, on his mother's orderswas tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog
	to capit all, professor mcgonagall summoned harry into her office, with such asomber expression on her face harry thought someone must have died
	there's no point hiding it from you any longer, potter, she said in avery serious voice
	i know this will come as a shock to you, but siriusblack i know he's after me, said harry wearily
	i heard ron's dad tellinghis mum
	weasley works for the ministry of magic
	professor mcgonagall seemed very taken aback
	she stared at harry for amoment or two, then said, i see well, in that case, potter, you'llunderstand why i don't think it's a good idea for you to be practicingquidditch in the evenings
	out on the field with only your team members,it's very exposed, potter we've got our first match on saturday said harry, outraged
	i've gotto train, professorprofessor mcgonagall considered him intently
	harry knew she was deeplyinterested in the gryffindor team's prospects it had been she, afterall, who'd suggested him as seeker in the first place
	he waited,holding his breath
	professor mcgonagall stood up and stared out of the window atthe quidditch field, just visible through the rain
	goodnessknows, i'd like to see us win the cup at last
	but all the same,potter
	i'd be happier if a teacher were present
	i'll ask madam hoochto oversee your training sessions
	the weather worsened steadily as the first quidditch match drew nearer
	undaunted, the gryffindor team was training harder than ever under theeye of madam hooch
	then, at their final training session beforesaturday's match, oliver wood gave his team some unwelcome news
	we're not playing slytherin he told them, looking very angry
	flint's just been to see me
	we're playing hufflepuff instead
	why chorused the rest of the team
	flint's excuse is that their seeker's arm's still injured, said wood,grinding his teeth furiously
	but it's obvious why they're doing it
	don't want to play in this weather
	think it'll damage theirchances
	there had been strong winds and heavy rain all day, and as wood spoke,they heard a distant rumble of thunder
	there's nothing wrong with malfoy's arm said harry furiously
	he'sfaking iti know that, but we can't prove it, said wood bitterly, and we'vebeen practicing all those moves assuming we're playing slytherin, andinstead it's hufflepuff, and their style's quite different
	they've gota new captain and seeker, cedric diggory angelina, alicia, and katie suddenly giggled
	what said wood, frowning at this lighthearted behavior
	he's that tall, goodlooking one, isn't he said angelina
	strong and silent, said katie, and they started to giggle again
	he's only silent because he's too thick to string two words together,said fred impatiently
	i don't know why you're worried, oliver,hufflepuff is a pushover
	last time we played them, harry caught thesnitch in about five minutes, rememberwe were playing in completely different conditions wood shouted, hiseyes bulging slightly
	diggory's put a very strong side together he'san excellent seeker i was afraid you'd take it like this we mustn'trelax we must keep our focus slytherin is trying to wrongfoot us wemust winoliver, calm down said fred, looking slightly alarmed
	we're takinghufflepuff very seriously
	the day before the match, the winds reached howling point and the rainfell harder than ever
	it was so dark inside the corridors andclassrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit
	the slytherin teamwas looking very smug indeed, and none more so than malfoy
	ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better he sighed as the galeoutside pounded the windows
	harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the matchtomorrow
	oliver wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and givinghim tips
	the third time this happened, wood talked for so long thatharry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for defense against thedark arts, and set off at a run with wood shouting after him, diggory'sgot a very fast swerve, harry, so you might want to try looping him harry skidded to a halt outside the defense against the dark artsclassroom, pulled the door open, and dashed inside
	sorry i'm late, professor lupin
	i but it wasn't professor lupin who looked up at him from the teacher'sdesk it was snape
	this lesson began ten minutes ago, potter, so i think we'll make it tenpoints from gryffindor
	but harry didn't move
	where's professor lupin he said
	he says he is feeling too ill to teach today, said snape with atwisted smile
	i believe i told you to sit downbut harry stayed where he was
	what's wrong with himsnape's black eyes glittered
	nothing lifethreatening, he said, looking as though he wished itwere
	five more points from gryffindor, and if i have to ask you to sitdown again, it will be fifty
	harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down
	snape looked around at theclass
	as i was saying before potter interrupted, professor lupin has not leftany record of the topics you have covered so far please, sir, we've done boggarts, red caps, kappas, and grindylows,said hermione quickly, and we're just about to start be quiet, said snape coldly
	i did not ask for information
	i wasmerely commenting on professor lupin's lack of organization
	he's the best defense against the dark arts teacher we've ever had,said dean thomas boldly, and there was a murmur of agreement from therest of the class
	snape looked more menacing than ever
	you are easily satisfied
	lupin is hardly overtaxing you  i ,wouldexpect first years to be able to deal with red caps and grindylows
	today we shall discuss harry watched him flick through the textbook, to the very back chapter,which he must know they hadn't covered
	werewolves, said snape
	but, sir, said hermione, seemingly unable to restrain herself, we'renot supposed to do werewolves yet, we're due to start hinkypunks miss granger, said snape in a voice of deadly calm, i was under theimpression that i am teaching this lesson, not you
	and i am telling youall to turn to page 394
	he glanced around again
	'all of you nowwith many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering, the classopened their books
	which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf andthe true wolf said snape
	everyone sat in motionless silence everyone except hermione, whosehand, as it so often did, had shot straight into the air
	anyone snape said, ignoring hermione
	his twisted smile was back
	are you telling me that professor lupin hasn't even taught you thebasic distinction between we told you, said parvati suddenly, we haven't got as far aswerewolves yet, we're still on silence snarled snape
	well, well, well, i never thought i'd meet athirdyear class who wouldn't even recognize a werewolf when they sawone
	i shall make a point of informing professor dumbledore how verybehind you all are
	please, sir, said hermione, whose hand was still in the air, thewerewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways
	the snout ofthe werewolf that is the second time you have spoken out of turn, miss granger,said snape coolly
	five more points from gryffindor for being aninsufferable knowitall
	hermione went very red, put down her hand, and stared at the floor withher eyes full of tears
	it was a mark of how much the class loathedsnape that they were all glaring at him, because every one of them hadcalled hermione a knowitall at least once, and ron, who told hermioneshe was a knowitall at least twice a week, said loudly, you asked usa question and she knows the answer why ask if you don't want to betoldthe class knew instantly he'd gone too far
	snape advanced on ronslowly, and the room held its breath
	detention, weasley, snape said silkily, his face very close to ron's
	and if i ever hear you criticize the way i teach a class again, youwill be very sorry indeed
	no one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson
	they sat and madenotes on werewolves from the textbook, while snape prowled up and downthe rows of desks, examining the work they had been doing with professorlupin
	very poorly explained
	that is incorrect, the kappa is more commonlyfound in mongolia
	professor lupin gave this eight out of ten iwouldn't have given it three
	when the bell rang at last, snape held them back
	you will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways yourecognize and kill werewolves
	i want two rolls of parchment or, thesubject, and i want them by monday morning
	it is time somebody tookthis class in hand
	weasley, stay behind, we need to arrange yourdetention
	harry and hermione left the room with the rest of the class, who waiteduntil they were well out of earshot, then burst into a furious tiradeabout snape
	snape's never been like this with any of our other defense against thedark arts teachers, even if he did want the job, harry said tohermione
	why's he got it in for lupin d'you think this is all becauseof the boggarti don't know, said hermione pensively
	but i really hope professorlupin gets better soon
	ron caught up with them five minutes later, in a towering rage
	d'you know what that  he called snape something that made hermionesay ron  is making me do i've got to scrub out the bedpans inthe hospital wing
	without magic he was breathing deeply, his fistsclenched
	why couldn't black have hidden in snape's office, eh hecould have finished him off for usharry woke extremely early the next morning so early that it was tilldark
	for a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him
	then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright peeves the poltergeist had been floating next to him, blowing hard inhis ear
	what did you do that for said harry furiously
	peeves puffed out hischeeks, blew hard, and zoomed backward out of the room, cackling
	harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it
	it was half pastfour
	cursing peeves, he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, butit was very difficult, now that he was awake, to ignore the sounds ofthe thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind against thecastle walls, and the distant creaking of the trees in the forbiddenforest
	in a few hours he would be out on the quidditch field, battlingthrough that gale
	finally, he gave up any thought of more sleep, gotup, dressed, picked up his nimbus two thousand, and walked quietly outof the dormitory
	as harry opened the door, something brushed against his leg
	he bentdown just in time to grab crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail anddrag him outside
	you know, i reckon ron was right about you, harry told crookshankssuspiciously
	there are plenty of mice around this place  go andchase them
	go on, he added, nudging crookshanks down the spiralstaircase with his foot
	leave scabbers alone
	the noise of the storm was even louder in the common roorn
	harry knewbetter than to think the match would be canceled quidditch matchesweren't called off for trifles like thunderstorms
	nevertheless, he wasstarting to feel very apprehensive
	wood had pointed out cedric diggoryto him in the corridor diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger thanharry
	seekers were usually lightand speedy, but diggory's weight would be an advantage in this weatherbecause he was less likely to be blown off course
	harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire, getting upevery now and then to stop crookshanks from sneaking upthe boys, staircase again
	at long last harry thought it must be timefor breakfast, so he headed through the portrait hole alone
	stand and fight, you mangy cur yelled sir cadogan
	oh, shut up, harry yawned
	he revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by the time he'dstarted on toast, the rest of the team had turned up
	it's going to be a tough one, said wood, who wasn't eating anything
	stop worrying, oliver, said alicia soothingly, we don't mind a bit ofrain
	but it was considerably more than a bit of rain
	such was the popularityof quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match asusual, but they ran down the lawns toward the quidditch field, headsbowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of theirhands as they went
	just before he entered the locker room, harry sawmalfoy, crabbe, and goyle, laughing and pointing at him from under anenormous umbrella on their way to the stadium
	the team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for wood's usualprematch pep talk, but it didn't come
	he tried to speak several times,made an odd gulping noise, then shook his head hopelessly and beckonedthem to follow him
	the wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked outonto the field
	if the crowd was cheering, they couldn't hear it overthe fresh rolls of thunder
	rain was splattering over harry's glasses
	how on earth was he going to see the snitch in thisthe hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field,wearing canaryyellow robes
	the captains walked up to eacb other andshook hands diggory smiled at wood but wood no, looked as though he hadlockjaw and merely nodded
	harry saw madam hooch's mouth form the words,mount your brooms
	,, he pulled his right foot out of the mud with asquelch and swung it over his nimbus two thousand
	madam hooch put herwhistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distantthey were offharry rose fast, but his nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind
	heheld it as steady as he could and turned, squinting into the rain
	within five minutes harry was soaked to his skin and frozen, hardly ableto see his teammates, let alone the tiny snitch
	he flew backward andforward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes, with noidea of what was happening in the rest of the game
	he couldn't hear thecommentary over the wind
	the crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaksand battered umbrellas
	twice harry came very close to being unseated bya bludger his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses hehadn't seen them coming
	he lost track of time
	it was getting harder and harder to hold hisbroom straight
	the sky was getting darker, as though night had decidedto come early
	twice harry nearly hit another player, without knowingwhether it was a teammate or opponent everyone was now so wet, and therain so thick, he could hardly tell them apart
	with the first flash of lightning came the sound of madam hooch'swhistle harry could just see the outline of wood through the thickrain, gesturing him to the ground
	the whole team splashed down into themud
	i called for timeout wood roared at his team
	come on, under herethey huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella harry tookoff his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes
	what's the scorewe're fifty points up, said wood, but unless we get the snitch soon,we'll be playing into the night
	i've got no chance with these on, harry said exasperatedly, waving hisglasses
	at that very moment, hermione appeared at his shoulder she was holdingher cloak over her head and was, inexplicably, beaming
	i've had an idea, harry give me your glasses, quickhe handed them to her, and as the team watched in amazement, hermionetapped them with her wand and said, imperviusthere she said, handing them back to harry
	they'll repel waterwood looked as though he could have kissed her
	brilliant he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into thecrowd
	okay, team, let's go for ithermione's spell had done the trick
	harry was still numb with cold,still wetter than he'd ever been in his life, but he could see
	full offresh determination, he urged his broom through the turbulent air,staring in every direction for the snitch, avoiding a bludger, duckingbeneath diggory, who was streaking in the opposite direction
	there was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by forkedlightning
	this was getting more and more dangerous
	harry needed to getthe snitch quickly he turned, intending to head back toward the middle of the field, but atthat moment, another flash of lightning illuminated the stands, andharry saw something that distracted him completely , the silhouette ofan enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted against the sky,motionless in the topmost, empty row of seats
	harry's numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his nimbus dropped afew feet
	shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes, he squinted backinto the stands
	the dog had vanished
	harry came wood's anguished yell from the gryffindor goal posts
	harry, behind youharry looked wildly around
	cedric diggory was pelting up the field, anda tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rainfilled air between themwith a jolt of panic, harry threw himself flat to the broornhandle andzoomed toward the snitch
	come on he growled at his nimbus as the rain whipped his face
	'tasterbut something odd was happening
	an eerie silence was falling across thestadium
	the wind, though as strong as ever, was forgetting to roar
	itwas as though someone had turned off the sound, as though harry had gonesuddenly deaf  what was going onand then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him, inside him,just as he became aware of something moving on the field below
	before he'd had time to think, harry had taken his eyes off the snitchand looked down
	at least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him,were standing beneath him
	it was as though freezing water were risingin his chest, cutting at his insides
	and then he heard it again
	someone was screaming, screaming inside his head
	not harry, not harry, please not harrystand aside, you silly girl
	not harry, please no, take me, kill me instead numbing, swirling white mist was filling harry's brain
	what was hedoing why was he flying he needed to help her
	she was going to be murdered
	he was falling, falling through the icy mist
	a shrill voice was laughing, the woman was screaming, and harry knew nomore
	lucky the ground was so soft
	i thought he was dead for sure
	but he didn't even break his glasses
	harry could hear the voices whispering, but they made no sensewhatsoever
	he didn't have a clue where he was, or how he'd got there,or what he'd been doing before he got there
	all he knew was that everyinch of him was aching as though it had been beaten
	that was the scariest thing i've ever seen in my life
	hooded black figures
	harry's eyes snapped open
	he was lying in the hospital wing
	thegryffindor quidditch team, spattered with mud from head to foot, wasgathered around his bed
	ron and hermione were also there, looking asthough they'd just climbed out of a swimming pool
	harry said fred, who looked extremely white underneath, the mud
	how're you feelingit was as though harry's memory was on fast forward
	the lightning the grim  the snitch  and the dementors
	what happened he said, sitting up so suddenly they all gasped
	you fell off, said fred
	must've been  what  fifty feetwe thought you'd died, said alicia, who was shaking
	hermione made a small, squeaky noise
	her eyes were extremely bloodshot
	but the match, said harry
	what happened are we doing a replayno one said anything
	the horrible truth sank into harry like a stone
	we didn't  losediggory got the snitch, said george
	he didn'trealize what had happened
	when he looked back and saw you on theground, he tried to call it off
	but they won fair andsquare
	where is wood said harry, suddenly realizing he wasn't there
	still in the showers, said fred
	we think he's trying to drownhimself
	harry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair
	fredgrabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly
	c'mon, harry, you've never missed the snitch before
	there had to be one time you didn't get it, said george
	it's not over yet, said fred
	we lost by a hundred pointsright so if hufflepuff loses to ravenclaw and we beat ravenclaw andslytherin
	hufflepuff'll have to lose by at least two hundred points, saidgeorge
	but if they beat ravenclaw
	no way, ravenclaw is too good
	but if slytherin loses againsthufflepuff
	it all depends on the points  a margin of a hundred either way
	harry lay there, not saying a word
	for the first timeever, he had lost a quidditch match
	after ten minutes or so, madam pomfrey came over to tell the team toleave him in peace
	we'll come and see you later, fred told him
	don't beat yourself up,harry, you're still the best seeker we've ever had
	the team trooped out, trailing mud behind them
	madam pomfrey shut thedoor behind them, looking disapproving
	ron and hermione moved nearer toharry's bed
	dumbledore was really angry, hermione said in a quaking voice
	i'venever seen him like that before
	he ran onto the field as you fell,waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground
	then he whirled his wand at the dementors
	shot silver stuff at them
	they left the stadium right away
	he was furious they'd come onto thegrounds
	we heard him then he magicked you onto a stretcher, said ron
	and walked up toschool with you floating on it
	everyone thought you were his voice faded, but harry hardly noticed
	he was thinking about whatthe dementors had done to him
	about the screaming voice
	he looked upand saw ron and hermione lookin, at him so anxiously that he quicklycast around for something matteroffact to say
	did someone get my nimbusron and hermione looked quickly at each other
	er what said harry, looking from one to the other
	when you fell off, it got blown away, said hermionehesitantly
	andand it hit  it hit  oh, harry  it hit the whomping willow
	harry's insides lurched
	the whomping willow was a very violent treethat stood alone in the middle of the grounds
	and he said, dreading the answer
	well, you know the whomping willow, said ron
	it  it doesn't likebeing hit
	professor flitwick brought it back just before you came around, saidhermione in a very small voice
	slowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside down,and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, theonly remains of harry's faithful, finally beaten broomstick
	chapter tenthe marauder's mapmadam pomfrey insisted on keeping harry in the hospital wing for therest of the weekend
	he didn't argue or complain, but he wouldn't lether throw away the shattered remnants of his nimbus two thousand
	heknew he was being stupid, knew that the nimbus was beyond repair, butharry couldn't help it he felt as though he'd lost one of his bestfriends
	he had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him up
	hagrid senthim a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages, andginny weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a getwell card shehad made herself, which sang shrilly unless harry kept it shut under hisbowl of fruit
	the gryffindor team visited again on sunday morning, thistime accompanied by wood, who told harry in a hollow, dead sort ofvoice that he didn't blamehim in the slightest
	ron and hermione left harry's bedside only atnight but nothing anyone said or did could make harry feel any better,because they knew only half of what was troubling him
	he hadn't told anyone about the grim, not even ron and hermione,because he knew ron would panic and hermione would scoff
	the factremained, however, that it had now appeared twice, and both appearanceshad been followed by nearfatal accidents the first time, he had nearlybeen run over by the knight bus the second, fallen fifty feet from hisbroomstick
	was the grim going to haunt him until he actually died washe going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for thebeastand then there were the dementors
	harry felt sick and humiliated everytime he thought of them
	everyone said the dementors were horrible, butno one else collapsed every time they went near one
	no one else heardechoes in their head of their dying parents
	because harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now
	he hadheard her words, heard them over and over again during the night hoursin the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at the strips ofmoonlight on the ceiling
	when the dementors approached him, he heardthe last moments of his mother's life, her attempts to protect him,harry, from lord voldemort, and voldemort's laughter before he murderedher
	harry dozed fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rottedhands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on hismother's voice
	it was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school onmonday, where he was forced to think about other things, eve', if he hadto endure draco malfoys taunting
	malfoy was almost beside himself withglee at gryffindor's defeat
	he had finally taken off his bandages, andcelebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spiritedimitations of harry falling off his broom
	malfoy spent much of theirnext potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon ronfinally cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at malfoy,which hit him in the face and caused snape to take fifty points fromgryffindor
	if snape's teaching defense against the dark arts again, i'm skivingoff, said ron as they headed toward lupin's classroom after lunch
	check who's in there, hermione
	hermione peered around the classroom door
	it's okayprofessor lupin was back at work
	it certainly looked as though he hadbeen ill
	his old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there weredark shadows beneath his eyes nevertheless, he smiled at the class asthey took their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion ofcomplaints about snape's behavior while lupin had been ill
	it's not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us homeworkwe don't know anything about werewolves two rolls of parchmentdid you tell professor snape we haven't covered them yet lupin asked,frowning slightly
	the babble broke out again
	yes, but he said we were really behind he wouldn't listen  two rolls of parchmentprofessor lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face
	i'll speak to professor snape
	you don't have to do theessay
	oh no, said hermione, looking very disappointed
	i've alreadyfinished itthey had a very enjoyable lesson
	professor lupin had brought along aglass box containing a hinkypunk, a little onelegged creature wholooked as though he were made of wisps of smoke, rather frail andharmless looking
	lures travelers into bogs, said professor lupin as they took notes
	you notice the lantern dangling from his hand hops ahead peoplefollow the light  then the hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass
	when the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for thedoor, harry among them, but wait a moment, harry, lupin called
	harry doubled back and watched professor lupin covering the hinkypunk'sbox with a cloth
	i heard about the match, said lupin, turning back to his desk andstarting to pile books into his briefcase, and i'm sorry about yourbroomstick
	is there any chance of fixing itno, said harry
	the tree smashed it to bits
	they planted the whomping willow the same year that i arrived athogwarts
	people used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touchthe trunk
	in the end, a boy called davey gudgeon nearly lost an eye,and we were forbidden to go near it
	no broomstick would have a chance
	did you hear about the dementors too said harry with difficulty
	lupin looked at him quickly
	i don't think any of us have seen professor dumbledore thatangry
	they have been growing restless for some time  furious at hisrefusal to let them inside the grounds
	i suppose they were thereason you fellyes, said harry
	he hesitated, and then the question he had to askburst from him before he could stop himself
	why why do they affect melike that am i just it has nothing to do with weakness, said professor lupin sharply, asthough he had read harry's mind
	the dementors affect you worse thanthe others because there are horrors in your past that the others don'thave
	a ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom, illuminatinglupin's gray hairs and the lines on his young face
	dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth
	theyinfest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair,they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them
	evenmuggles feel their presence, though they can't see them
	get too near adementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked outof you
	if it can, the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduceyou to something like itself
	you'll be left withnothing but the worst experiences of your life
	and the worst thathappened to you, harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their broom
	you have nothing to feel ashamed of
	when they get near me  harry stared at lupin's desk, his throattight
	i can hear voldemort murdering my mum
	lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip harry'sshoulder, but thought better of it
	there was a moment's silence, thenwhy did they have to come to the match said harry bitterly
	they're getting hungry, said lupin coolly, shutting his briefcase witha snap
	dumbledore won't let them into the school, so their supply ofhuman prey has dried up
	i don't think they could resist the largecrowd around the quidditch field
	all that excitement
	emotionsrunning high
	it was their idea of a feast
	azkaban must be terrible, harry muttered
	the fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don'tneed walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they're alltrapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheery thought
	most of them go mad within weeks
	but sirius black escaped from them, harry said slowly
	lupin's briefcase slipped from the desk he had to stoop quickly tocatch it
	yes, he said, straightening up, black must have found a way to fightthem
	i wouldn't have believed it possible
	dementors are supposed todrain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long
	you made that dementor on the train back off, said harry suddenly
	there are  certain defenses one can use, said lupin
	but there wasonly one dementor on the train
	the more there are, the more difficultit becomes to resist
	what defenses said harry at once
	can you teach mei don't pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors, harry, quite thecontrary
	but if the dementors come to another quidditch match, i need to be ableto fight them lupin looked into harry's determined face, hesitated, then said,well
	but it'll have to wait until nextterm, i'm afraid
	i have a lot to do before the holidays
	i chose a veryinconvenient time to fall ill
	what with the promise of antidementor lessons from lupin, the thoughtthat he might never have to hear his mother's death again, and the factthat ravenclaw flattened hufflepuff in their quidditch match at the endof november, harry's mood took a definite upturn
	gryffindor were notout of the running after all, although they could not afford to loseanother match
	wood became repossessed of his manic energy, and workedhis team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted intodecember
	harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds
	dumbledore's anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at theentrances
	two weeks before the end of the term, the sky lightened suddenly to adazzling, opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morningcovered in glittering frost
	inside the castle, there was a buzz ofchristmas in the air
	professor flitwick, the charms teacher, hadalready decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned outto be real, fluttering fairies
	the students were all happily discussingtheir plans for the holidays
	both ron and hermione had decided toremain at hogwarts, and though ron said it was because he couldn't standtwo weeks with percy, and hermione insisted she needed to use thelibrary, harry wasn't fooled they were doing it to keep him company,and he was very grateful
	to everyone's delight except harry's, there was to be another hogsmeadetrip on the very last weekend of the term
	we can do all our christmas shopping there said hermione
	mum anddad would really love those toothflossing stringmints from honeydukesresigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behindagain, harry borrowed a copy of which broomstick from wood, and decidedto spend the day reading up on the different makes
	he had been ridingone of the school brooms at team practice, an ancient shooting star,which was very slow and jerky he definitely needed a new broom of hisown
	on the saturday morning of the hogsmeade trip, harry bid goodbye to ronand hermione, who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up themarble staircase alone, and headed back toward gryffindor tower
	snowhad started to fall outside the windows, and the castle was very stilland quiet
	psst  harryhe turned, halfway along the thirdfloor corridor, to see fred andgeorge peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked, oneeyedwitch
	what are you doing said harry curiously
	how come you're not goingto hogsmeadewe've come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go, said fred,with a mysterious wink
	he nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the oneeyed statue
	harry followed fred and george inside
	george closed the door quietlyand then turned, beaming, to look at harry
	early christmas present for you, harry, he said
	fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid iton one of the desks
	it was a large, square, very worn piece ofparchment with nothing written on it
	harry, suspecting one of fred andgeorge's jokes, stared at it
	what's that supposed to bethis, harry, is the secret of our success, said george, patting theparchment fondly
	it's a wrench, giving it to you, said fred, but we decided lastnight, your need's greater than ours
	anyway, we know it by heart, said george
	we bequeath it to you
	wedon't really need it anymore
	and what do i need with a bit of old parchment said harry
	a bit of old parchment said fred, closing his eyes with a grimace asthough harry had mortally offended him
	when we were in our first year, harry  young, carefree, andinnocent harry snorted
	he doubted whether fred and george had ever beeninnocent
	well, more innocent than we are now  we got into a spot of botherwith filch
	we let off a dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reasonso he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with theusual  detention disembowelment and we couldn't help noticing adrawer in one of his filing cabinets marked confiscated and highlydangerous
	don't tell me  said harry, starting to grin
	well, what would you've done said fred
	george caused a diversion bydropping another dungbomb, i whipped the drawer open, and grabbed this
	it's not as bad as it sounds, you know, said george
	we don't reckonfilch ever found out how to work it
	he probably suspected what it was,though, or he wouldn't have confiscated it
	and you know how to work itoh yes, said fred, smirking
	this little beauty's taught us more thanall the teachers in this school
	you're winding me up, said harry, looking at the ragged old bit ofparchment
	oh, are we said george
	he took out his wand, touched the parchment lightly, and said, isolemnly swear that i am up to no good
	and at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a spider's web from thepoint that george's wand had touched
	they joined each other, theycrisscrossed, they fanned into every corner of the parchment then wordsbegan to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, thatproclaimedmessrs
	moony, wormtail, padfoot, and prongspurveyors of aids to magical mischiefmakers are proud to present themarauder's mapit was a map showing every detail of the hogwarts castle and grounds
	but the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it,each labeled with a name in minuscule writing
	astounded, harry bentover it
	a labeled dot in the top left corner showed that professordumbledore was pacing his study the caretaker's cat, mrs
	norris, wasprowling the second floor and peeves the poltergeist was currentlybouncing around the trophy room
	and as harry's eyes traveled up anddown the familiar corridors, he noticed something else
	this map showed a set of passages he had never entered
	and many of themseemed to lead right into hogsmeade, said fred, tracing one of them with his finger
	there are seven in all
	now, filch knows about these four  hepointed them out  but we're sure we're the only ones who know aboutthese
	don't bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor
	we used it until last winter, but it's caved in  completely blocked
	and we don't reckon anyone's ever used this one, because the whompingwillow's planted right over the entrance
	but this one here, this oneleads right into the cellar of honeydukes
	we've used it loads of times
	and as you might've noticed, the entrance is right outside this room,through that oneeyed old crone's hump
	moony, wormtaill padfoot, and prongs, sighed george, patting theheading of the map
	noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers,said fred solemnly
	right, said george briskly
	don't forget to wipe it after you've usedit or anyone can read it, fred said warningly
	just tap it again and say, 'mischief managed' and it'll go blank
	so, young harry, said fred, in an uncanny impersonation of percy,mind you behave yourself
	see you in honeydukes, said george, winking
	they left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of way
	harry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map
	he watched the tiny inkmrs
	norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor
	iffilch really didn't know
	he wouldn't have to pass the dementors atall
	but even as he stood there, flooded with excitement, something harry hadonce heard mr
	weasley say came floating out of his memory
	never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can't see whereit keeps its brain
	this map was one of those dangerous magical objects mr
	weasley had beenwarning against
	aids for magical mischief makers
	but then, harryreasoned, he only wanted to use it to get into hogsmeade, it wasn't asthough he wanted to steal anything or attack anyone
	and fred andgeorge had been using it for years without anything horriblehappening
	harry traced the secret passage to honeydukes with his finger
	then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he rolled up the map,stuffed it inside his robes, and hurried to the door of the classroom
	he opened it a couple of inches
	there was no one outside
	verycarefully, he edged out of the room and behind the statue of theoneeyed witch
	what did he have to do he pulled out the map again and saw to hisastonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon it, labeled harrypotter
	this figure was standing exactly where the real harry wasstanding, about halfway down the thirdfloor corridor
	harry watched carefully
	his little ink self appeared to be tapping thewitch with his minute wand
	harry quickly took out his real wand andtapped the statue
	he looked back at the map
	thetiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure
	the word insidesaid, dissendium
	dissendium harry whispered, tapping the stone witch again
	at once, the statue's hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thinperson
	harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked themap away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushedhimself forward
	he slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, thenlanded on cold, damp earth
	he stood up, looking around
	he held up his wand, muttered, lumos  and saw that he wasin a very narrow, low, earthy passageway
	he raised the map, tapped itwith the tip of his wand, and muttered, mischief managed the map wentblank at once
	he folded it carefully, tucked it inside his robes, then,heart beating fast, both excited and apprehensive, he set off
	the passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow of a giant rabbitthan anything else
	harry hurried along it, stumbling now and then onthe uneven floor, holding his wand out in front of him
	it took ages, but harry had the thought of honeydukes to sustain him
	after what felt like an hour, the passage began to rise
	panting, harrysped up, his face hot, his feet very cold
	ten minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn stone steps, whichrose out of sight above him
	careful not to make any noise, harry beganto climb
	a hundred steps, two hundred steps, he lost count as heclimbed, watching his feet
	then, without warning, his head hitsomething hard
	it seemed to be a trapdoor
	harry stood there, massaging the top of hishead, listening
	he couldn't hear any sounds above him
	very slowly, hepushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge
	he was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates and boxes
	harryclimbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it  it blended so perfectlywith the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there
	harrycrept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs
	now he coulddefinitely hear voices, not to mention the tinkle of a bell and theopening and shutting of a door
	wondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a door open much closerat hand somebody was about to come downstairs
	and get another box of jelly slugs, dear, they've nearly cleaned us out said a woman's voice
	a pair of feet was coming down the staircase
	harry leapt behind anenormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass
	he heard the manshifting boxes against the opposite wall
	he might not get anotherchance quickly and silently, harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbedthe stairs looking back, he saw an enormous backside and shiny baldhead, buried in a box
	harry reached the door at the top of the stairs,slipped through it, and found himself behind the counter of honeydukes he ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up
	honeydukes was so crowded with hogwarts students that no one lookedtwice at harry
	he edged among them, looking around, and suppressed alaugh as he imagined the look that would spread over dudley's piggy faceif he could see where harry was now
	there were shelves upon shelves of the most succulentlooking sweetsimaginable
	creamy chunks of nougat, shimmering pink squares of coconutice, fat, honeycolored toffees hundreds of different kinds ofchocolate in neat rows there was a large barrel of every flavor beans,and another of fizzing whizbees, the levitating sherbert balls that ronhad mentioned along yet another wall were special effects  sweetsdroobles best blowing gum which filled a room with bluebellcoloredbubbles that refused to pop for days, the strange, splinterytoothflossing stringmints, tiny black pepper imps breathe fire foryour friends, ice mice hear your teeth chatter and squeak,peppermint creams shaped like toads hop realistically in thestomach, fragile sugarspun quills, and exploding bonbons
	harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a signhanging in the farthest corner of the shop unusual tastes
	ron andhermione were standing underneath it, examining a tray of bloodflavoredlollipops
	harry sneaked up behind them
	ugh, no, harry won't want one of those, they're for vampires, iexpect, hermione was saying
	how about these said ron, shoving a jar of cockroach clusters underhermione's nose
	definitely not, said harry
	ron nearly dropped the jar
	harry squealed hermione
	what are you doing here how  how did youwow said ron, looking very impressed, you've learned to apparate'course i haven't, said harry
	he dropped his voice so that none ofthe sixth years could hear him and told them all about the marauder'smap
	how come fred and george never gave it to me said ron, outraged
	i'mtheir brotherbut harry isn't going to keep it said hermione, as though the ideawere ludicrous
	he's going to hand it in to professor mcgonagall,aren't you, harryno, i'm not said harry
	are you mad said ron, goggling at hermione
	hand in something thatgoodif i hand it in, i'll have to say where i got it filch would know fredand george had nicked itbut what about sirius black hermione hissed
	he could be using oneof the passages on that map to get into the castle the teachers havegot to knowhe can't be getting in through a passage, said harry quickly
	thereare seven secret tunnels on the map, right fred and george reckon filchalready knows about four of them
	and of the other three  one ofthem's caved in, so no one can get through it
	one of them's got thewhomping willow planted over the entrance, so you can't get out of it
	and the one i just came through well   it's really hard to see theentrance to it down in the cellar, so unless he knew it was there
	what if black did know the passage was thereron, however, cleared his throat significantly, and pointed to a noticepasted on the inside of the sweetshop door
	by order of  the ministry of magiccustomers are reminded that until further notice, dementors will bepatrolling the streets of hogsmeade every night after sundown
	thismeasure has been put in place for the safety of hogsmeade residents andwill be lifted upon the recapture of sirius black
	it is thereforeadvisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall
	merry christmassee said ron quietly
	i'd like to see black try and break intohoneydukes with dementors swarming all over the village
	anyway,hermione, the honeydukes owners would hear a breakin, wouldn't theythey live over the shopyes, but but  hermoine seemed to be struggling to find anotherproblem
	look, harry still shouldn't be coming into hogsmeade
	hehasn't got a signed form if anyone finds out, he'll be in so muchtrouble and it's not nightfall yet  what if sirius black turns uptoday nowhe'd have a job spotting harry in this, said ron, nodding through themullioned windows at the thick, swirling snow
	come on, hermione, it'schristmas
	harry deserves a break
	hermione bit her lip, looking extremely worried
	are you going to report me harry asked her, grinning
	oh  of course not  but honestly, harry seen the fizzing whizbees, harry said ron, grabbing him and leadinghim over to their barrel
	and the jelly slugs and the acid pops fredgave me one of those when i was seven  it burnt a hole right throughmy tongue
	i remember mum walloping him with her broomstick
	ron staredbroodingly into the acid pop box
	reckon fred'd take a bit of cockroachcluster if i told him they were peanutswhen ron and hermione had paid for all their sweets, the three of themleft honeydukes for the blizzard outside
	hogsmeade looked like a christmas card the little thatched cottages andshops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow there were hollywreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in thetrees
	harry shivered unlike the other two, he didn't have his cloak
	theyheaded up the street, heads bowed against the wind, ron and hermioneshouting through their scarves
	that's the post officezonko's is up there we could go up to the shrieking shacktell you what, said ron, his teeth chattering, shall we go for abutterbeer in the three broomsticksharry was more than willing the wind was fierce and his hands werefreezing, so they crossed the road, and in a few minutes were enteringthe tiny inn
	it was extremely crowded, noisy, warm, and smoky
	a curvy sort of womanwith a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlock' up at the bar
	that's madam rosmerta, said ron
	i'll get the drinks, shall i headded, going slightly red
	harry and hermione made their way to the back of the room, ,,her, therewas a small, vacant table between the window and a handsome christmastree, which stood next to the fireplace
	ron came back five minuteslater, carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer
	merry christmas he said happily, raising his tankard
	it was the most delicious thing he'd ever tasted andseemed to heat every bit of him from the inside
	a sudden breeze ruffled his hair
	the door of the three broomsticks hadopened again
	harry looked over the rim of his tankard and choked
	professors mcgonagall and flitwick had just entered the pub with aflurry of snowflakes, shortly followed by hagrid, who was deep inconversation with a portly man in a limegreen bowler hat and apinstriped cloak  cornelius fudge, minister of magic
	in an instant, ron and hermione had both placed hands on the top ofharry's head and forced him off his stool and under the table
	drippingwith butterbeer and crouching out of sight, harry clutched his emptytankard and watched the teachers' and fudge's feet move toward the bar,pause, then turn and walk right toward him
	somewhere above him, hermione whispered, mobiliarbusthe christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the ground,drifted sideways, and landed with a soft thump right in front of theirtable, hiding them from view
	staring through the dense lower branches,harry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right besidetheirs, then heard the grunts and sighs if the teachers and minister asthey sat down
	next he saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high heels,and heard a woman's voice
	a small gillywater mine, said professor mcgonagall's voice
	four pints of mulled mead ta, rosmerta, said hagrid
	a cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella mmm said professor flitwick, smacking his lips
	so you'll be the red currant rum, minister
	thank you, rosmerta, m'dear, said fudge's voice
	lovely to see youagain, i must say
	have one yourself, won't you come and join us
	well, thank you very much, minister
	harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again
	his heartwas pounding uncomfortably in his throat
	why hadn't it occurred to himthat this was the last weekend of term for the teachers to and how longwere they going to sit there he needed time to sneak back intohoneydukes if he wanted to return to school tonight
	hermione's leggave a nervous twitch next to him
	so, what brings you to this neck of the woods, minister came madamrosmerta's voice
	harry saw the lower part of fudge's thick body twist in his chair asthough he were checking for eavesdroppers
	then he said in a quietvoice, what else, m'dear, but sirius black i daresay you heard whathappened up at the school at halloweeni did hear a rumor, admitted madam rosmerta
	did you tell the whole pub, hagrid said professor mcgonagallexasperatedly
	do you think blacks still in the area, minister whispered madamrosmerta
	i'm sure of it, said fudge shortly
	you know that the dementors have searched the whole village twjcesaid madam rosmerta, a slight edge to her voice
	scared all mycustomers away
	it's very bad for business, minister
	rosmerta, dear, i don't like them any more than you do, said fudgeuncomfortably
	necessary precaution
	unfortunate, but there youare
	i've just met some of them
	they're in a fury against dumbledore he won't let them inside the castle grounds
	i should think not, said professor mcgonagall sharply
	how are wesupposed to teach with those horrors floating aroundhear, hear squeaked tiny professor flitwick, whose feet were danglinga foot from the ground
	all the same, demurred fudge, they are here to protect you all fromsomething much worse
	we all know what black's capable of
	do you know, i still have trouble believing it, said madam rosmertathoughtfully
	of all the people to go over to the dark side, siriusblack was the last i'd have thought
	i mean, i remember him when hewas a boy at hogwarts
	if you'd told me then what he was going tobecome, i'd have said you'd had too much mead
	you don't know the half of it, rosmerta, said fudge gruffly
	theworst he did isn't widely known
	the worst said madam rosmerta, her voice alive with curiosity, worsethan murdering all those poor people, you meani certainly do, said fudge
	what could possibly be worse you say youremember him at hogwarts, rosmerta, mur mured professor mcgonagall
	do you remember who hisbest friend wasnaturally, said madam rosmerta, with a small laugh
	never saw onewithout the other, did you the number of times i had them in here ooh, they used to make me laugh
	quite the double act, sirius black andjames potterharry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk
	precisely, said professor mcgonagall
	ringleadersof their little gang
	both very bright, of course  exceptionallybright, in fact  but i don't think we've ever had such a pair oftroublemakers i dunno, chuckled hagrid
	fred and george weasley could give 'em arun fer their money
	you'd have thought black and potter were brothers chimed in professorflitwick
	inseparableof course they were, said fudge
	potter trusted black beyond all hisother friends
	nothing changed when they left school
	black was best manwhen james married lily
	then they named him godfather to harry
	harryhas no idea, of course
	you can imagine how the idea would torment him
	because black turned out to be in league with youknowwho whisperedmadam rosmerta
	worse even than that, rn'dear
	fudge dropped his voice andproceeded in a sort of low rumble
	not many people are aware that thepotters knew youknowwho was after them
	dumbledore, who was of courseworking tirelessly against youknowwho, had a number of useful spies
	one of them tipped him off, and he alerted james and lily at once
	headvised them to go into hiding
	well, of course, youknowwho wasn't aneasy person to hide from
	dumbledore told them that their best chancewas the fidelius charm
	how does that work said madam rosmerta, breathless with interest
	professor flitwick cleared his throat
	an immensely complex spell, he said squeakily, involving the magicalconcealment of a secret inside a single, living soul
	the information ishidden inside the chosen person, or secretkeeper, and is henceforthimpossible to find  unless, of course, the secretkeeper chooses todivulge it
	as long as the secretkeeper refused to speak, youknowwhocould search the village where lily and james were staying for years andnever find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against theirsitting room windowso black was the potters' secretkeeper whispered madam rosmerta
	naturally, said professor mcgonagall
	james potter told dumbledorethat black would die rather than tell where they were, that black wasplanning to go into hiding himself
	and yet, dumbledore remainedworried
	i remember him offering to be the potters' secretkeeperhimself
	he suspected black gasped madam rosmerta
	he was sure that somebody close to the potters had been keepingyouknowwho informed of their movements, said professor mcgonagalldarkly
	indeed, he had suspected for some time that someone on our sidehad turned traitor and was passing a lot of information toyouknowwho
	but james potter insisted on using blackhe did, said fudge heavily
	and then, barely a week after thefidelius charm had been performed  black betrayed them breathedmadam rosmerta
	black was tired of his doubleagent role, he was readyto declare his support openly for youknowwho, and he seems to haveplanned this for the moment of the potters' death
	but, as we all know,youknowwho met his downfall in little harry potter
	powers gone,horribly weakened, he fled
	and this left black in a very nasty positionindeed
	his master had fallen at the very moment when he, black, hadshown his true colors as a traitor
	he had no choice but to run for itfilthy, stinkin' turncoat hagrid said, so loudly that half the barwent quiet
	shh said professor mcgonagall
	i met him growled hagrid
	i musta bin the last ter see him before hekilled all them people it was me what rescued harry from lily an'james's house after they was killed jus' got him outta the ruins, poorlittle thing, with a great slash across his forehead, an' his parentsdead
	an' sirius black turns up, on that flyin' motorbike he used terride
	never occurred ter me what he was doin' there
	i didn' know he'dbin lily an' james's secretkeeper
	thought he'd jus' heard the news o'youknowwho's attack an' come ter see what he could do
	white an'shakin', he was
	an' yeh know what i did i comforted the murderin'traitor hagrid roared
	hagrid, please said professor mcgonagall
	keep your voice downhow was i ter know he wasn' upset abou' lily an' james it wasyouknowwho he cared abou' an' then he says, 'give harry ter me,hagrid, i'm his godfather, i'll look after him ' ha but i'd had meorders from dumbledore, an' i told black no, dumbledore said harry waster go ter his aunt an' uncle's
	black argued, but in the end he gavein
	told me ter take his motorbike ter get harry there
	'i won't need itanymore,' he says
	i shoulda known there was somethin' fishy goin' on then
	he loved thatmotorbike, what was he givin' it ter me for why wouldn' he need itanymore fact was, it was too easy ter trace
	dumbledore knew he'd binthe potters' secretkeeper
	black knew he was goin' ter have ter run ferit that night, knew it was a matter o' hours before the ministry wasafter him
	but what if i'd given harry to him, eh i bet he'd 've pitched him offthe bike halfway out ter sea
	his bes' friends' son but when a wizardgoes over ter the dark side, there's nothin' and no one that matters toem anymore
	a long silence followed hagrid's story
	then madam rosmerta said withsome satisfaction, but he didn't manage to disappear, did he theministry of magic caught up with him next dayalas, if only we had, said fudge bitterly
	it was not we who foundhim
	it was little peter pettigrew  another of the potters' friends
	maddened by grief, no doubt, and knowing that black had been thepotters' secretkeeper, he went after black himself
	that fat little boy who was always tagging around afterthem at hogwarts said madam rosmerta
	heroworshipped black and potter, said professor mcgonagall
	neverquite in their league, talentwise
	i was often rather ,harp with him
	you can imagine how i how i regret that now
	she sounded as thoughshe had a sudden head cold
	there, now, minerva, said fudge kindly, pettigrew died a hero'sdeath
	eyewitnesses  muggles, of course, we wiped their, memorieslater  told us how pettigrew cornered black
	they say he was sobbing,'lily and james, sirius how could you' and then he went for his wand
	well, of course, black was quicker
	blew pettigrew to smithereens
	professor mcgonagall blew her nose and said thickly, stupid boy
	he was always hopeless at dueling
	should have left itto the ministry
	i tell yeh, if i'd got ter black before little pettigrew did, iwouldn't 've messed around with wands  i'd 've ripped him limb  from limb, hagrid growled
	you don't know what you're talking about, hagrid, said fudge sharply
	nobody but trained hit wizards from the magical law enforcement squadwould have stood a chance against black once he was cornered
	i wasjunior minister in the department of magical catastrophes at the time,and i was one of the first on the scene after black murdered all thosepeople
	i  i will never forget it
	i still dream about it sometimes
	acrater in the middle of the street, so deep it had cracked the sewerbelow
	and black standing therelaughing, with what was left of pettigrew in front of him
	a heap ofbloodstained robes and a few  a few fragments fudge's voice stopped abruptly
	there was the sound of five noses beingblown
	well, there you have it, rosmerta, said fudge thickly
	black wastaken away by twenty members of the magical law enforcement 'squad andpettigrew received the order of merlin, first class, which i think wassome comfort to his poor mother
	blades been in azkaban ever since
	madam rosmerta let out a long sigh
	is it true he's mad, ministeri wish i could say that he was, said fudge slowly
	i certainlybelieve his master's defeat unhinged him for a while
	the murder ofpettigrew and all those muggles was the action of a cornered anddesperate man  cruel
	yet i met black on my lastinspection of azkaban
	you know, most of the prisoners in there sitmuttering to themselves in the dark there's no sense in them
	but iwas shocked at how normal black seemed
	he spoke quite rationally to me
	you'd have thought he was merely bored  asked if i'dfinished with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he missed doing thecrossword
	yes, i was astounded at how little effect the dementorsseemed to be having on him  and he was one of the most heavily guardedin the place, you know
	dementors outside his door day and night
	but what do you think he's broken out to do said madam rosmerta
	good gracious, minister, he isn't trying to rejoin youknowwho, ishei daresay that is his  er  eventual plan, said fudge evasively
	but we hope to catch black long before that
	i must say, youknowwhoalone and friendless is one thing
	but give him back his most devotedservant, and i shudder to think how quickly he'll rise again
	there was a small chink of glass on wood
	someone had set down theirglass
	you know, cornelius, if you're dining with the headmaster, he'd betterhead back up to the castle, said professor mcgonagall
	one by one, the pairs of feet in front of harry took the weight of theirowners once more hems of cloaks swung into sight, and madam rosemerta'sglittering heels disappeared behind the bar
	the door of the threebroomsticks opened again, there was another flurry of snow, and theteachers had disappeared
	harryron's and hermione's faces appeared under the table
	they were bothstaring at him, lost for words
	chapter eleventhe fireboltharry didn't have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get backinto the honeydukes cellar, through the tunnel, and into the castle oncemore
	all he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time atall, and that he hardly noticed what he was doing, because his head wasstill pounding with the conversation he had just heard
	why had nobody ever told him dumbledore, hagrid, mr
	weasley, corneliusfudge
	why hadn't anyone ever mentioned the fact that harry's parentshad died because their best friend had betrayed themron and herinione watched harry nervously all through dintier, notdaring to talk about what they'd overheard, because percy was sittingclose by them
	when they went upstairs to the crowded common room, itwas to find fred and george had set off half a dozen dungbombs in a fitof end ofterm high spirits
	harry, who didn't want fred and georgeasking him whether he'd reached hogsmeade or not, sneaked quietly up tothe empty dormitory and headed straight for his bedside cabinet
	hepushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for  theleatherbound photo album hagrid had given him two years ago, which wasfull of wizard pictures of his mother and father
	he sat down on hisbed, drew the hangings around him, and started turning the pages,searching, until
	he stopped on a picture of his parents' wedding day
	there was hisfather waving up at him, beaming, the untidy black hair harry hadinherited standing up in all directions
	there was his mother, alightwith happiness, arm in arm with his dad
	harry had never given him a thought before
	if he hadn't known it was the same person, he would never have guessedit was black in this old photograph
	his face wasn't sunken and waxy,but handsome, full of laughter
	had he already been working forvoldemort when this picture had been taken was he already planning thedeaths of the two people next to him did he realize he was facingtwelve years in azkaban, twelve years that would make himunrecognizablebut the dementors don't affect him, harry thought, staring into thehandsome, laughing face
	he doesn't have to hear my min screaming ifthey get too close harry slammed the album shut, reached over and stuffed it back into hiscabinet, took off his robe and glasses and got into bed, making sure thehangings were hiding him from view
	the dormitory door opened
	harry said ron's voice uncertainly
	but harry still, pretending to be asleep
	he heard ron leave again, androlled over on his back, his eyes wide open
	a hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through harrylike poison
	he could see black laughing at him through the darkness, asthough somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes
	hewatched, as though somebody was playing him a piece of film, siriusblack blasting peter pettigrew who resembled neville longbottom into athousand pieces
	he could hear though having no idea what black's voicemight sound like a low, excited mutter
	it has happened, my lord
	the potters have made me their secretkeeper and then came anothervoice, laughing shrilly, the same laugh that harry heard inside his headwhenever the dementors drew near
	harry, you  you look terrible
	harry hadn't gotten to sleep until daybreak
	he had awoken to find thedormitory deserted, dressed, and gone down the spiral staircase to acommon room that was completely empty except for ron, who was eating apeppermint toad and massaging his stomach, and hermione, who had spreadher homework over three tables
	where is everyone said harry
	gone it's the first day of the holidays, remember said ron, watchingharry closely
	it's nearly lunchtime i was going to come and wake youup in a minute
	harry slumped into a chair next to the fire
	snow was still fallingoutside the windows
	crookshanks was spread out in front of the firelike a large, ginger rug
	you really don' look well, you know, hermione said, peering anxiouslyinto his face
	harry, listen, said hermione, exchanging a look with ron, you must bereally upset about what we heard yesterday
	but the thing is, youmustn't go doing anything stupid
	like trying to go after black, said ron sharply
	harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had beenasleep
	he didn't say anything
	you won't, will you, harry said hermione
	because black's not worth dying for, said ron
	they didn't seem to understand at all
	d'you know what i see and hear every time a dementor gets too near meron and hermione shook their heads, looking apprehensive
	i can hear mymum screaming and pleading with voldemort
	and if you'd heard your mumscreaming like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn't forget it ina hurry
	and if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend ofhers betrayed her and sent voldemort after her there's nothing you can do said hermione, looking stricken
	thedementors will catch black and he'll go back to azkaban and  and servehim rightyou heard what fudge said
	black isn't affected by azkaban like normalpeople are
	it's not a punishment for him like it is for the others
	so what are you saying said ron, looking very tense
	you want to to kill black or somethingdon't be silly, said herinione in a panicky voice
	harry doesn't wantto kill anyone, do you, harryagain, harry didn't answer
	he didn't know what he wanted to do
	all heknew was that the idea of doing nothing, while black was at liberty, wasalmost more than he could stand
	malfoy knows, he said abruptly
	remember what he said to me inpotions 'if it was me, i'd hunt him down myself
	you're going to take malfoy's advice instead of ours said ronfuriously
	you know what pettigrew's mother got back afterblack had finished with him dad told me  the order of merlin, firstclass, and pettigrew's finger in a box
	that was the biggest bit of himthey could find
	black's a madman, harry, and he's dangerous malfoy's dad must have told him, said harry, ignoring ron
	he wasright in voldemort's inner circle say youknowwho, will you interjected ron angrily
	so obviously, the malfoys knew black was working for voldemort  and malfoy'd love to see you blown into about a million pieces, likepettigrew get a grip
	malfoy's just hoping you'll get yourself killedbefore he has to play you at quidditch
	harry, please, said hermione, her eyes now shining with tears, pleasebe sensible
	black did a terrible, terrible thing, but ddon't putyourself in danger, it's what black wants
	oh, harry, you'd beplaying right into black's hands if you went looking for him
	your mumand dad wouldn't want you to get hurt, would they they'd never want youto go looking for blacki'll never know what they'd have wanted, because thanks to black, i'venever spoken to them, said harry shortly
	there was a silence in which crookshanks stretched luxuriously flexinghis claws
	ron's pocket quivered
	look, said ron, obviously casting around for a change of subject,it's the holidays it's nearly christmas let's  let's go down andsee hagrid
	we haven't visited him for agesno said hermione quickly
	harry isn't supposed to leave the castle,ron yeah, let's go, said harry, sitting up, and i can ask him how come henever mentioned black when he told me all about my parentsfurther discussion of sirius black plainly wasn't what ron had had inmind
	or we could have a game of chess, he said hastily, or gobstones
	percyleft a set no, let's visit hagrid, said harry firmly
	so they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through theportrait hole stand and fight, you yellowbellied mongrels, downthrough the empty castle and out through the oak front doors
	they made their way slowly down the lawn, making a shallow trench in theglittering, powdery snow, their socks and the hems of their cloakssoaked and freezing
	the forbidden forest looked as though it had beenenchanted, each tree smattered with silver, and hagrid's cabin lookedlike an iced cake
	ron knocked, but there was no answer
	he's not out, is he said hermione, who was shivering under her cloak
	ron had his ear to the door
	there's a weird noise, he said
	listen  is that fangharry and hermione put their ears to the door too
	from inside the cabincame a series of low, throbbing moans
	think we'd better go and get someone said ron nervously
	hagrid called harry, thumping the door
	hagrid, are you in there
	there was a sound of heavy footsteps, then the door creaked open
	hagridstood there with his eyes red and swollen, tears splashing down thefront of his leather vest
	ywve heard he bellowed, and he flung himself onto harry's neck
	hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man, this was nolaughing matter
	harry, about to collapse under hagrid's weight, wasrescued by ron and hermione, who each seized hagrid under an arm andheaved him back into the cabin
	hagrid allowed himself to be steeredinto a chair and slumped over the table, sobbing uncontrollably, hisface glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard
	hagrid, what is it said hermione, aghast
	harry spotted an officiallooking letter lying open on the table
	what's this, hagridhagrid's sobs redoubled, but he shoved the letter toward harry, whopicked it up and read alouddear mr
	hagrid,further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student inyour class, we have accepted the assurances of professor dumbledore thatyou bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident
	well, that's okay then, hagrid said ron, clapping hagrid oil theshoulder
	but hagrid continued to sob, and waved one of his gigantichands, inviting harry to read on
	however, we must register our concern about the hippogriff in question
	we have decided to uphold the official complaint of mr
	lucius malfoy,and this matter will therefore be taken to the committee for thedisposal of dangerous creatures
	the hearing will take place on april20th, and we ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at thecommittee's offices in london on that date
	in the meantime, thehippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated
	there followed a list of the school governors
	but you said buckbeak isn't a bad hippogriff, hagrid
	ibet he'll get offyeh don' know them gargoyles at the committee fer the disposal o'dangerous creatures choked hagrid, wiping his eyes on his sleeve
	they've got it in fer interestin' creaturesa sudden sound from the corner of hagrid's cabin made harry, ron, andhermione whip around
	buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor
	i couldn' leave him tied up out there in the snow choked hagrid
	allon his own at christmas
	harry, ron, and hermione looked at one another
	they had never seen eyeto eye with hagrid about what he called interesting creatures andother people called terrifying monsters
	or' the other hand, theredidn't seem to be any particular harm in buckbeak
	in fact, by hagrid'susual standards, he was positively cute
	you'll have to put up a good strong defense, hagrid, said hermione,sitting down and laying a hand on hagrid's massive forearm
	i'm sureyou can prove buckbeak is safe
	won't make no diff'rence sobbed hagrid
	them disposal devils,they're all in lucius malfoy's pocket scared o' him ad if i lose thecase, buckbeak hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then gave a great wailand lurched forward, his face in his arms
	what about dumbledore, hagrid said harry
	he's done more'n enough fer me already, groaned hagrid
	got enough onhis plate what with keepin' them dementors outta the castle, an' siriusblack lurkin' around ron and hermione looked quickly at harry, as though expecting him tostart berating hagrid for not telling him the truth about black
	butharry couldn't bring himself to do it, not now that he saw hagrid somiserable and scared
	listen, hagrid, he said, you can't give up
	hermione's right, youjust need a good defense
	you can call us as witnesses i'm sure i've read about a case of hippogriffbaiting, said hermionethoughtfully, where the hippogriff got off i'll look it up for you,hagrid, and see exactly what happened
	hagrid howled still more loudly
	harry and hermione looked at ron tohelp them
	er  shall i make a cup of tea said ron
	it's what my mum does whenever someone's upset, ron muttered,shrugging
	at last, after many more assurances of help, with a steaming mug of teain front of him, hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of atablecloth and said, yer right
	i can' afford to go ter pieces
	gottapull meself together
	fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid hishead on hagrid's knee
	i've not bin meself lately, said hagrid, stroking fang with one handand mopping his face with the other
	worried abou' buckbeak, an' no onelikin' me classes we do like them lied hermione at once
	yeah, they're great said ron, crossing his fingers under the table
	er  how are the flobberwormsdead, said hagrid gloomily
	oh no said ron, his lip twitching
	an' them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an' all, said hagrid,with a sudden shudder
	gotta walk past 'em ev'ry time i want a drink inthe three broomsticks
	's like bein' back in azkaban he fell silent, gulping his tea
	harry, ron, and hermione watched himbreathlessly
	they had never heard hagrid talk about his brief spell inazkaban before
	after a pause, hermione said timidly, is it awful inthere, hagridyeh've no idea, said hagrid quietly
	never bin anywhere like it
	thought i was goin' mad
	kep' goin' over horrible stuff in me mind
	the day i got expelled from hogwarts
	day i had terlet norbert go
	his eyes filled with tears
	norbert was the baby dragon hagrid had oncewon in a game of cards
	yeh can' really remember who yeh are after a while
	an' yeh can' reallysee the point o' livin' at all
	i used ter hope i'd jus' die in mesleep
	when they let me out, it was like bein' born again, ev'rythin' icame floodin' back, it was the bes' feelin' in the world
	mind, thedementors weren't keen on lettin' me go
	but you were innocent said hermione
	think that matters to them they don' care
	long as they've got acouple o' hundred humans stuck there with 'em, so they can leech all thehappiness out of 'em, they don' give a damn who's guilty an' who's not
	hagrid went quiet for a moment, staring into his tea
	then he saidquietly, thought o' jus' letting buckbeak go
	tryin' ter make him flyaway
	but how d'yeh explain ter a hippogriff it's gotta go interhidin' an' an' i'm scared o' breakin' the law
	he looked up atthem, tears leaking down his face again
	i don' ever want ter go backter azkaban
	the trip to hagrid's, though far from fun, had nevertheless had theeffect ron and hermione had hoped
	though harry had by no meansforgotten about black, he couldn't brood constantly on revenge if hewanted to help hagrid win his case against the committee for thedisposal of dangerous creatures
	he, ron, and hermione went to thelibrary the next day and returned to the empty common room laden withbooks that might help prepare a defense for buckbeak
	the three of themsat in front of the roaring fire, slowly turning the pages of dustyvolumes about famous cases if marauding beasts, speaking occasionallywhen they ran across something relevant
	there was a case in 1722
	but the hippogriff wasconvicted  ugh, look what they did to it, that's disgusting this might help, look  a manticore savaged someone in 1296, and theylet the manticore off  oh  no, that was only because everyone wastoo scared to go near it
	meanwhile, in the rest of the castle, the usual magnificent christmasdecorations had been put up, despite the fact that hardly any of thestudents remained to enjoy them
	thick streamers of holly and mistletoewere strung along the corridors, mysterious lights shone from insideevery suit of armor, and the great hall was filled with its usual twelvechristmas trees, glittering with golden stars
	a powerful and delicioussmell of cooking pervaded the corridors, and by christmas eve, it hadgrown so strong that even scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter ofron's pocket to sniff hopefully at the air
	on christmas morning, harry was woken by ron throwing his pillow at him
	oy presentsharry reached for his glasses and put them on, squinting through thesemidarkness to the foot of his bed, where a small heap of parcels hadappeared
	ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents
	'another sweater from mum
	see if you've got one
	weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with thegryffindor lion knitted on the front, also a dozen homebaked mincepies, some christmas cake, and a box of nut brittle
	as he moved allthese things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying underneath
	what's that said ron, looking over, a freshly unwrapped pair ofmaroon socks in his hand
	harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent, gleamingbroomstick rolled out onto his bedspread
	ron dropped his socks andjumped off his bed for a closer look
	i don't believe it, he said hoarsely
	it was a firebolt, identical to the dream broom harry had gone to seeevery day in diagon alley
	its handle glittered as he picked it up
	hecould feel it vibrating and let go it hung in midair, unsupported, atexactly the right height for him to mount it
	his eyes moved from thegolden registration number at the top of the handle, right down to theperfectly smooth, streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail
	who sent it to you said ron in a hushed voice
	look and see if there's a card, said harry
	ron ripped apart the firebolt's wrappings
	nothing blimey, who'd spend that much on youwell, said harry, feeling stunned, i'm betting it wasn't thedursleys
	i bet it was dumbledore, said ron, now walking around and around thefirebolt, taking in every glorious inch
	he sent you the invisibilitycloak anonymously
	that was my dad's, though, said harry
	dumbledore was just passing iton to me
	he wouldn't spend hundreds of galleons on me
	he can't gogiving students stuff like this that's why he wouldn't say it was from him said ron
	in case somegit like malfoy said it was favoritism
	hey, harry  ron gave a greatwhoop of laughter  malfoy wait till he sees you on this he'll besick as a pig this is an international standard broom, this isi can't believe this, harry muttered, running a hand along thefirebolt, while ron sank onto harry's bed, laughing his head off at thethought of malfoy
	who i know, said ron, controlling himself, i know who it could've been lupinwhat said harry, now starting to laugh himself lupin listen, if hehad this much gold, he'd be able to buy himself some new robes
	yeah, but he likes you, said ron
	and he was away when your nimbusgot smashed, and he might've heard about it and decided to visit diagonalley and get this for you what d'you mean, he was away said harry
	he was ill when i wasplaying in that match
	well, he wasn't in the hospital wing, said ron
	i was there, cleaningout the bedpans on that detention from snape, rememberharry frowned at ron
	i can't see lupin affording something like this
	what're you two laughing abouthermione had just come in, wearing her dressing gown and carryingcrookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tiedaround his neck
	don't bring him in here said ron, hurriedly snatching scabbers fromthe depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket
	but hermione wasn't listening
	she dropped crookshanks onto seamus'sempty bed and stared, openmouthed, at the firebolt
	oh, harry who sent you thatno idea, said harry
	there wasn't a card or anything with it
	to his great surprise, hermione did not appear either excited orintrigued by the news
	on the contrary, her face fell, and she bit herlip
	what's the matter with you said ron
	i don't know, said hermione slowly, but it's a bit odd, isn't it imean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn't itron sighed exasperatedly
	it's the best broom there is, hermione, he said
	so it must've been really expensive
	probably cost more than all the slytherins' brooms put together, saidron happily
	who'd send harry something as expensive as that, and not eventell him they'd sent it said hermione
	who cares said ron impatiently
	listen, harry, can i have a go onit can ii don't think anyone should ride that broom just yet said hermioneshrilly
	harry and ron looked at her
	what d'you think harry's going to do with it  sweep the floor saidron
	but before hermione could answer, crookshanks sprang from seamus's bed,right at ron's chest
	get  him  out  of  here ron bellowed as crookshanks's clawsripped his pajamas and scabbers attempted a wild escape over hisshoulder
	ron seized scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick atcrookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of harry's bed, knocking itover and causing ron to hop up and down, howling with pain
	crookshanks's fur suddenly stood on end
	a shrill, tint,, whistling wasfilling the room
	the pocket sneakoscope had become dislodged from unclevernon's old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor
	i forgot about that harry said, bending down and picking up thesneakoscope
	i never wear those socks if i can help it
	the sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm
	crookshanks washissing and spitting at it
	you'd better take that cat out of here, hermione, said ron furiously,sitting on harry's bed nursing his toe
	can't you shut that thing uphe added to harry as hermione strode out of the room, crookshanks'syellow eyes still fixed maliciously on ron
	harry stuffed the sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it backinto his trunk
	all that could be heard now were ron's stifled moans ofpain and rage
	scabbers was huddled in ron's hands
	it had been a whilesince harry had seen him out of ron's pocket, and he was unpleasantlysurprised to see that scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinnypatches of fur seemed to have fallen out toohe's not looking too good, is he harry said
	he'd be fine if that big stupid furball lefthim alonebut harry, remembering what the woman at the magical menagerie had saidabout rats living only three years, couldn't help feeling that unlessscabbers had powers he had never revealed, he was reaching the end ofhis life
	and despite ron's frequent conplaints that scabbers was bothboring and useless, he was sure ron would be very miserable if scabbersdied
	christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the gryffindorcommon room that morning
	hermione had shut crookshanks in herdormitory, but was furious with ron for trying to kick him ron wasstill fuming about crookshanks's fresh attempt to eat scabbers
	harrygave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself toexamining the firebolt, which he had brought down to the common roomwith him
	for some reason this seemed to annoy hermione as well shedidn't say anything, but she kept looking darkly at the broom as thoughit too had been criticizing her cat
	at lunchtime they went down to the great hall, to find that the housetables had been moved against the walls again, and that a single table,set for twelve, stood in the middle of the room
	professors dumbledore,mcgonagall, snape, sprout, and flitwick were there, along with filch,the caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing avery old and rather moldy looking tailcoat
	there were only three otherstudents, two extremely nervouslooking first years and a sullenfacedslytherin fifth year
	merry christmas said dumbledore as harry, ron, and hermioneapproached the table
	as there are so few of us, it seemed foolish touse the house tables
	sit down, sit downharry, ron, and hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table
	crackers said dumbledore enthusiastically, offering the end of alarge silver noisemaker to snape, who took it reluctantly and tugged
	with a bang like a gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal a large,pointed witchs hat topped with a stuffed vulture
	harry, remembering the boggart, caught ron's eye and they both grinnedsnape's mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward dumbledore, whoswapped it for his wizard's hat at once
	dig in he advised the table, beaming around
	as harry was helping himself to roast potatoes, the doors of the greathall opened again
	it was professor trelawney, gliding toward them asthough on wheels
	she had put on a green sequined dress in honor of theoccasion, making her look more than ever like a glittering, oversizeddragonfly
	sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise said dumbledore, standing up
	i have been crystal gazing, headmaster, said professor trelawney inher mistiest, most faraway voice, and to my astonishment, i saw myselfabandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you
	who am i torefuse the promptings of fate i at once hastened from my tower, and ido beg you to forgive my lateness
	certainly, certainly, said dumbledore, his eyes twinkling
	let medraw you up a chair and he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand, which revolvedfor a few seconds before falling with a thud between professors snapeand mcgonagall
	professor trelawney, however, did not sit down herenormous eyes had been roving around the table, and she suddenly uttereda kind of soft scream
	i dare not, headmaster if i join the table, we shall be thirteennothing could be more unlucky never forget that when thirteen dinetogether, the first to rise will be the first to diewe'll risk it, sibyll, said professor mcgonagall inpatiendy
	do sitdown, the turkey's getting stone cold
	professor trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the emptychair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though expecting athunderbolt to hit the table
	professor mcgonagall poked a large spooninto the nearest tureen
	tripe, sibyllprofessor trelawney ignored her
	eyes open again, she looked around oncemore and said, but where is dear professor lupini'm afraid the poor fellow is ill again, said dumbledore, indicatingthat everybody should start serving themselves
	most unfortunate thatit should happen on christmas day
	but surely you already knew that, sibyll said professor mcgonagall,her eyebrows raised
	professor trelawney gave professor mcgonagall a very cold look
	certainly i knew, minerva, 11 she said quietly
	but one does notparade the fact that one is all knowing
	i frequently act as though iam not possessed of the inner eye, so as not to make others nervous
	that explains a great deal, said professor mcgonagall tartly
	professor trelawney's voice suddenly became a good deal less misty
	if you must know, minerva, i have seen that poor professor lupin willnot be with us for very long
	he seems aware, himself, that his time isshort
	he positively fled when i offered to crystal gaze for him imagine that, said professor mcgonagall dryly
	i doubt, said dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice,which put an end to professor mcgonagall and professor trelawney'sconversation, that professor lupin is in any immediate danger
	severus,you've made the potion for him againyes, headmaster, said snape
	w  what said harry, scrambling tohis feet
	whyit will need to be checked for jinxes, said professor mcgonagall
	ofcourse, i'm no expert, but i daresay madam hooch and professor flitwickwill strip it down strip it down repeated ron, as though professor mcgonagall was mad
	it shouldn't take more than a few weeks, said professor mcgonagall
	you will have it back if we are sure it is jinxfree
	there's nothing wrong with it said harry, his voice shaking slightly
	honestly, professor you can't know that, potter, said professor mcgonagall, quite kindly,not until you've flown it, at any rate, and i'm afraid that is out ofthe question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with
	ishall keep you informed
	professor mcgonagall turned on her heel and carried the firebolt out ofthe portrait hole, which closed behind her
	harry stood staring afterher, the tin of highfinish polish still clutched in his hands
	ron,however, rounded on hermione
	what did you go running to mcgonagall forhermione threw her book aside
	she was still pink in the face, but stoodup and faced ron defiantly
	because i thought  and professor mcgonagall agrees with me  thatthat broom was probably sent to harry by sirius blackchapter twelvethe patronusharry knew that hermione had meant well, but that didn't stop him frombeing angry with her
	he had been the owner of the best broom in theworld for a few short hours, and now, because of her interference, hedidn't know whether he would ever see it again
	he was positive thatthere was nothing wrong with the firebolt now, but what sort of statewould it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of antijinxtestsron was furious with hermione too
	as far as he was concerned, thestrippingdown of a brand new firebolt was nothing less than criminaldamage
	hermione, who remained convinced that she had acted for thebest, started avoiding the common room
	harry and ron supposed she hadtaken refuge in the library and didn't try to persuade her to come back
	all in all, they were glad when the rest of the school returned shortlyafter new year, and gryffindor tower became crowded and noisy again
	wood sought harry out on the night before term started
	had a good christmas he said, and then, without waiting for ananswer, he sat down, lowered his voice, and said, i've been, doing somethinking over christmas, harry
	after last match, you know
	if thedementors come to the next one
	we can't afford you to well wood broke off, looking awkward
	i'm working on it, said harry quickly
	professor lupin said he'dtrain me to ward off the dementors
	we should be starting this week
	hesaid he'd have time after christmas
	ah, said wood, his expression clearing
	well, in that case  ireally didn't want to lose you as seeker, harry
	and have you ordered anew broom yetno, said harry
	what you'd better get a move on, you know  you can't ride thatshooting star against ravenclawhe got a firebolt for christmas, said ron
	a firebolt no seriously a  a real fireboltdon't get excited, oliver, said harry gloomily
	i haven't got itanymore
	and he explained all about how thefirebolt was now being checked for jinxes
	jinxed how could it be jinxedsirius black harry said wearily
	he's supposed to be after me
	somcgonagall reckons he might have sent it
	waving aside the information that a famous murderer was after hisseeker, wood said, but black couldn't have bought a firebolt he's onthe run the whole country's on the lookout for him how could he justwalk into quality quidditch supplies and buy a broomsticki know, said harry, but mcgonagall still wants to strip it down wood went pale
	i'll go and talk to her, harry, he promised
	i'll make her seereason
	a real firebolt, on our team
	she wantsgryffindor to win as much as we do
	i'll make her see sense
	classes started again the next day
	the last thing anyone felt likedoing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw january morning,but hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for theirenjoyment, and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry woodand leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flameloving lizardsscampered up and down the crumbling, whitehot logs
	the firstdivination lesson of the new term was much less fun professor trelawneywas now teaching them palmistry, and she lost no time in informing harrythat he had the shortest life line she had ever seen
	it was defense against the dark arts that harry was keen to get toafter his conversation with wood, he wanted to get started on hisantidementor lessons as soon as possible
	ah yes, said lupin, when harry reminded him of his promise at the endof class
	how about eight o'clock on thursday eveningthe history of magic classroom should be large enough
	i'll have tothink carefully about how we're going to do this
	we can't bring areal dementor into the castle to practice on
	still looks ill, doesn't he said ron as they walked down thecorridor, heading to dinner
	what d'you reckon's the matter with himthere was a loud and impatient tuh from behind them
	it was hermione,who had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor, repacking her bag,which was so full of books it wouldn't close
	and what are you tutting at us for said ron irritably
	nothing, said hermione in a lofty voice, heaving her bag back over hershoulder
	yes, you were, said ron
	i said i wonder what's wrong with lupin, andyou well, isn't it obvious said hermione, with a look of maddeningsuperiority
	if you don't want to tell us, don't, snapped ron
	fine, said hermione haughtily, and she marched off
	she doesn't know, said ron, staring resentfully after hermione
	she'sjust trying to get us to talk to her again
	at eight o'clock on thursday evening, harry left gryffindor tower forthe history of magic classroom
	it was dark and empty when he arrived,but he lit the lamps with his wand and had waited only five minutes whenprofessor lupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which heheaved onto professor binn's desk
	what's that said harry
	another boggart, said lupin, stripping off his cloak
	i've beencombing the castle ever since tuesday, and very luckily, i found thisone lurking inside mr
	filch's filing cabinet
	it's the nearest we'llget to a real dementor
	the boggart will turn into a dementor when hesees you, so we'll be able to practice on him
	i can store him in myoffice when we're not using him there's a cupboard under my desk he'lllike
	okay, said harry, trying to sound as though he wasn't apprehensive atall and merely glad that lupin had found such a good substitute for areal dementor
	professor lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated thatharry should do the same
	the spell i am going to try and teach you ishighly advanced magic, harry  well beyond ordinary wizarding level
	itis called the patronus charm
	how does it work said harry nervously
	well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a patronus, said lupin,which is a kind of anti dementor  a guardian that acts as a shieldbetween you and the dementor
	harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a hagridsizedfigure holding a large club
	professor lupin continued, the patronus isa kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that thedementor feeds upon  hope, happiness, the desire to survive  but itcannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt it
	but i must warn you, harry, that the charm might be too advanced foryou
	many qualified wizards have difficulty with it
	what does a patronus look like said harry curiously
	each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it
	and how do you conjure itwith an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating,with all your might, on a single, very happy memory
	harry cast his mind about for a happy memory
	certainly, nothing thathad happened to him at the dursleys' was going to do
	finally, hesettled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick
	right, he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful,soaring sensation of his stomach
	the incantation is this  lupin cleared his throat
	expectopatronumexpecto patronum,  harry repeated under his breath, expectopatronum
	concentrating hard on your happy memoryoh  yeah  said harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to thatfirst broom ride
	expecto patrono  no, patronum  sorry  expectopatronum, expecto patronumsomething whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand it looked like awisp of silvery gas
	did you see that said harry excitedly
	something happenedvery good, said lupin, smiling
	right, then  ready to try it on adementoryes, harry said, gripping his wand very tightly, and moving into themiddle of the deserted classroom
	he tried to keep his mind on flying,but something else kept intruding
	any second now, he might hear hismother again
	but he shouldn't think that, or he would hear her again,and he didn't want to
	or did helupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled
	a dementor rose slowly from the box, its hooded face turned towardharry, one glistening, scabbed hand gripping its cloak
	the lamps aroundthe classroom flickered and went out
	the dementor stepped from the boxand started to sweep silently toward harry, drawing a deep, rattlingbreath
	a wave of piercing cold broke over him expecto patronum harry yelled
	expecto patronum expecto but the classroom and the dementor were dissolving
	harry was failingagain through thick white fog, and his mother's voice was louder thanever, echoing inside his head  not harry not harry please  i'lldo anythingstand aside
	stand aside, girlharryharry jerked back to life
	he was lying flat on his back on the floor
	the classroom lamps were alight again
	he didn't have to ask what hadhappened
	sorry, he muttered, sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling downbehind his glasses
	are you all right said lupin
	harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned againstit
	here  lupin handed him a chocolate frog
	eat this before we tryagain
	i didn't expect you to do it your first time in fact, i wouldhave been astounded if you had
	it's getting worse, harry muttered, biting off the frog's head
	icould hear her louder that time  and him  voldemortlupin looked paler than usual
	,harry, if you don't want to continue, i will more than understand i do said harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the chocolate froginto his mouth
	i've got to what if the dementors turn up at our matchagainst ravenclaw i can't afford to fall off again
	if we lose thisgame we've lost the quidditch cupall right then
	you might want to select 'othermemory, a happy memory, i mean, to concentrate on
	that one doesn'tseem to have been strong enough
	harry thought hard and decided his feelings when gryffindor had won thehouse championship last year had definitely qualified as very happy
	hegripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle ofthe classroom
	ready said lupin, gripping the box lid
	ready, said harry trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughtsabout gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going tohappen when the box opened
	go said lupin, pulling off the lid
	the room went icily cold and darkonce more
	the dementor glided forward, drawing its breath one rottinghand was extending toward harry expecto patronum harry yelled
	expecto patronum expecto pat white fog obscured his senses
	big, blurred shapes were moving aroundhim
	then came a new voice, a man's voice, shouting, panicking lily, take harry and go it's him go run i'll hold him off the sounds of someone stumbling ftom a room  a door bursting open  acackle of high pitched laughter harry harry
	lupin was tapping harry hard on the face
	this time it was a minutebefore harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor
	i heard my dad, harry mumbled
	that's the first time i've ever heardhim  he tried to take on voldemort himself, to give my mum time to runfor it
	harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling withthe sweat
	he bent his face as low as possible, wiping them off on hisrobes, pretending to do up his shoelace, so that lupin wouldn't see
	you heard james said lupin in a strange voice
	face dry, harry looked up
	why  you didn't know my dad, didyoui  i did, as a matter of fact, said lupin
	we were friends athogwarts
	listen, harry  perhaps we should leave it here for tonight
	this charm is ridiculously advanced
	i shouln't have suggestedputting you through this
	i'll have one more go i'm notthinking of happy enough things, that's what it is
	a really, really happy memory
	one that he couldturn into a good, strong patronus
	the moment when he'd first found out he was a wizard, and would beleaving the dursleys for hogwarts if that wasn't a happy memory, hedidn't know what was
	concentrating very hard on how he had felt whenhe'd realized he'd be leaving privet drive, harry got to his feet andfaced the packing case once more
	ready said lupin, who looked as though he were doing this against hisbetter judgment
	concentrating hard all right  gohe pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the dementorrose out of it the room fell cold and dark'expecto patronum harry bellowed
	expecto patronum expecto patronumthe screaming inside harry's head had started again  except this time,it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio  softerand louder and softer again  and he could still see the dementor  ithad halted  and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of theend of harry's wand, to hover between him and the dementor, and thoughharry's legs felt like water, he was still on his feet  though for howmuch longer, he wasn't sure riddikulus roared lupin, springing forward
	there was a loud crack, and harry's cloudy patronus vanished along withthe dementor he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he'd justrun a mile, and felt his legs shaking
	out of the corner of his eye, hesaw professor lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case withhis wand it had turned into a silvery orb again
	excellent lupin said, striding over to where harry sat
	excellent,harry that was definitely a startcan we have another go just one more gonot now, said lupin firmly
	you've had enough for one night
	here he handed harry a large bar of honeydukes' best chocolate
	eat the lot, or madam pomfrey will be after my blood
	same time nextweekokay, said harry
	he took a bite of the chocolate and watched lupinextinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of thedementor
	a thought had just occurred to him
	professor lupin he said
	if you knew my dad, you must've knownsirius black as well
	lupin turned very quickly
	what gives you that idea he said sharply
	nothing  i mean, i just knew they were friends at hogwarts too
	yes, i knew him, he said shortly
	you'd better beoff, harry, it's getting late
	harry left the classroom, walking along the corridor and around acorner, then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on itsplinth to finish his chocolate, wishing he hadn't mentioned black, aslupin was obviously not keen on the subject
	then harry's thoughtswandered back to his mother and father
	he felt drained and strangely empty, even though he was so full ofchocolate
	terrible though it was to hear his parents' last momentsreplayed inside his head, these were the only times harry had heardtheir voices since he was a very small child
	but he'd never be able toproduce a proper patronus if he half wanted to hear his parentsagain
	they're dead, he told himself sternly
	they're dead and listening toechoes of them won't bring them back
	you'd better get a grip onyourself if you want that quidditch cup
	he stood up, crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth, andheaded back to gryffindor tower
	ravenclaw played slytherin a week after the start of term
	slytherinwon, though narrowly
	according to wood, this was good news forgryffindor, who would take second place if they beat ravenclaw too
	hetherefore increased the number of team practices to five a leek
	thismeant that with lupin's antidementor classes, which in themselves weremore draining than six quidditch practices, harry had just one night aweek to do all his homework
	even so, he was showing the strain nearlyas much as hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to be gettingto her
	every night, without fail, hermione was to be seen in a cornerof the common room, several tables spread with books, arithmancy charts,rune dictionaries, diagrams of muggles lifting heavy objects, and fileupon file of extensive notes she barely spoke to anybody and snappedwhen she was interrupted
	how's she doing it ron muttered to harry one evening as harry satfinishing a nasty essay on undetectable poisons for snape
	hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books
	doing whatgetting to all her classes ron said
	i heard her talking toprofessor vector, that arithmancy witch, this morning
	they were goingon about yesterday's lesson, but hermione can't 've been there, becauseshe was with us in care of magical creatures and ernie mcmillan told meshe's never missed a muggle studies class, but half of them are at thesame time as divination, and she's never missed one of them eitherharry didn't have time to fathom the mystery of hermione's impossibleschedule at the moment he really needed to get on with snape's essay
	two seconds later, however, he was interrupted again, this time by wood
	i've just been to see professor mcgonagall about thefirebolt
	she  er  got a bit shirty with me
	told m' i'd got mypriorities wrong
	seemed to think i cared more about winning the cupthan i do about you staying alive
	just because i told her i didn't careif it threw you off, as long as you caught the snitch first
	wood shookhis head in disbelief
	honestly, the way she was yelling at me
	you'dthink i'd said something terrible
	then i asked her how much longershe was going to keep it
	he screwed up his face and imitated professormcgonagall's severe voice
	'as long as necessary, wood'
	i reckon it'stime you ordered a new broom, harry
	there's an order form at the backof which broomstick
	you could get a nimbus two thousand and one, likemalfoy's got
	i'm not buying anything malfoy thinks is good, said harry flatly
	january faded imperceptibly into february, with no change in thebitterly cold weather
	the match against ravenclaw was drawing nearerand nearer, but harry still hadn't ordered a new broom
	he was nowasking professor mcgonagall for news of the firebolt after everytransfiguration lesson, ron standing hopefully at his shoulder, hermionerushing past with her face averted
	no, potter, you can't have it back yet, professor mcgonagall told himthe twelfth time this happened, before he'd even opened his mouth
	we've checked for most of the usual curses, but professor flitwickbelieves the broom might be carrying a hurling hex
	i shall tell youonce we've finished checking it
	now, please stop badgering me
	to make matters even worse, harry's antidementor lessons were not goingnearly as well as he had hoped
	several sessions on, he was able toproduce an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the boggartdementorapproached him, but his patronus was too feeble to drive the dementoraway
	all it did was hover, like a semitransparent cloud, draining harryof energy as he fought to keep it there
	harry felt angry with himself,guilty about his secret desire to hear his parents' voices again
	you're expecting too much of yourself, said professor lupin, sternlyin their fourth week of practice
	for a thirteenyearold wizard, evenan indistinct patronus is a huge achievement
	you aren't passing outanymore, are youi thought a patronus would  charge the dementors down or something,said harry dispiritedly
	make them disappear the true patronus does do that, said lupin
	but you've achieved agreat deal in a very short space of time
	if the dementors put in anappearance at your next quidditch match, you will be able to keep themat bay long enough to get back to the ground
	you said it's harder if there are loads of them, said harry
	i have complete confidence in you, said lupin, smiling
	here you've earned a drink  something from the three broomsticks
	you won'thave tried it before he pulled two bottles out of his briefcase
	butterbeer said harry, without thinking
	yeah, i like that stufflupin raised an eyebrow
	oh ron and hermione brought me some back from hogsmeade, harry liedquickly
	i see, said lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious
	well let's drink to a gryffindor victory against ravenclaw not that i'msupposed to take sides, as a teacher
	he added hastilythey drank the butterbeer in silence, until harry voiced something he'dbeen wondering for a while
	what's under a dementor's hoodprofessor lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully
	well, the only people who really know are in no condition totell us
	you see, the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last andworst weapon
	what's thatthey call it the dementor's kiss, said lupin, with a slightly twistedsmile
	it's what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly
	isuppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamptheir jaws upon the mouth of the victim and  and suck out his soul
	harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer
	what  they kill oh no, said lupin
	much worse than that
	you can exist without yoursoul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working
	butyou'll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no
	there's no chance at all of recovery
	and your soul is gone forever
	lupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, it's the fate thatawaits sirius black
	it was in the daily prophet this morning
	theministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they findhim
	harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soulsucked out through their mouth
	but then he thought of black
	he deserves it, he said suddenly
	you think so said lupin lightly
	do you really think anyone deservesthatyes, said harry defiantly
	he would have liked to have told lupin about the conversation he'doverheard about black in the three broomsticks, about black betrayinghis mother and father, but it would have involved revealing that he'dgone to hogsmeade without permission, and he knew lupin wouldn't be veryimpressed by that
	so he finished his butterbeer, thanked lupin, andleft the history of magic classroom
	harry half wished that he hadn't asked what was under a dementor's hood,the answer had been so horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasantthoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of youthat he walked headlong into professor mcgonagall halfway up the stairs
	do watch where you're going, pottersorry, professor i've just been looking for you in the gryffindor common room, well,here it is, we've done everything we could think of, and there doesn'tseem to be anything wrong with it at all
	you've got a very good friendsomewhere, potter
	she was holding out his firebolt, and it looked asmagnificent as ever
	i can have it back harry said weakly
	seriouslyseriously, said professor mcgonagall, and she was actually smiling
	idaresay you'll need to get the feel of it before saturday's match, won'tyou and potter  do try and win, won't you or we'll be out of therunning for the eighth year
	in a row, as professor snape was kindenough to remind me only last night
	speechless, harry carried the firebolt back upstairs toward gryffindortower
	as he turned a corner, he saw ron dashing toward him, grinningfrom ear to ear
	she gave it to you excellent listen, can i still have a go on ittomorrowyeah
	anything, said harry, his heart lighter than it had been in amonth
	you know what  we should make up with hermione
	she wasonly trying to help
	yeah, all right, said ron
	she's in the common room how working, fora change they turned into the corridor to gryffindor tower and saw nevillelongbottom, pleading with sir cadogan, who seemed to be refusing himentrance
	i wrote them down neville was saying tearfully
	but i must'vedropped them somewherea likely tale roared sir cadogan
	then, spotting harry and ron goodeven, my fine young yeomen come clap this loon in irons
	he is tryingto force entry to the chambers withinoh, shut up, said ron as he and harry drew level with neville
	i've lost the passwords neville told them miserably
	i made him tellme what passwords he was going to use this week, because he keepschanging them, and now i don't know what i've done with themoddsbodikins, said harry to sir cadogan, who looked extremelydisappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the commonroom
	there was a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and thenext moment, harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over hisfirebolt
	where'd you get it, harrywill you let me have a go have you ridden it yet, harryravenclaw'll have no chance, they're all on cleansweep sevenscan i just hold it, harryafter ten minutes or so, during which the firebolt was passed around andadmired from every angle, the crowd dispersed and harry and ron had aclear view of hermione, the only person who hadn't rushed over to them,bent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes
	harry and ronapproached her table and at last, she looked up
	i got it back, said harry, grinning at her and holding up thefirebolt
	see, hermione there wasn't anything wrong with it said ron
	well  there might have been said hermione
	i mean, at least youknow now that it's safeyeah, i suppose so, said harry
	id better put it upstairs
	i'll take it said ron eagerly
	i've got to give scabbers his rattonic
	he took the firebolt and, holding it as if it were made of glass,carried it away up the boys' staircase
	can i sit down, then harry asked hermione
	i suppose so, said hermione, moving a great stack of parchment off achair
	harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long arithmancy essayon which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer muggle studiesessay explain why muggles need electricity and at the runetranslation hermione was now poring over
	how are you getting through all this stuff harry asked her
	oh, well  you know  working hard, said hermione
	closeup, harrysaw that she looked almost as tired as lupin
	why don't you just drop a couple of subjects harry asked, watchingher lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary
	i couldn't do that said hermione, looking scandalized
	arithmancy looks terrible, said harry, picking up a verycomplicatedlooking number chart
	oh no, it's wonderful said hermione earnestly
	it's my favoritesubject it's but exactly what was wonderful about arithmancy, harry never found out
	at that precise moment, a strangled yell echoed down the boys'staircase
	the whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at theentrance
	then came hurried footsteps, growing louder and louder  andthen ron came leaping into view, dragging with him a bedsheet
	look he bellowed, striding over to hermione's table
	look he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face
	ron, what scabbers look scabbershermione was leaning away from ron, looking utterly bewildered
	harrylooked down at the sheet ron was holding
	there was something red on it
	something that looked horribly like blood ron yelled into the stunned silence
	he's gone and you knowwhat was on the floorn  no, said hermione in a trembling voice
	ron threw something down onto hermione's rune translation
	hermione andharry leaned forward
	lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes wereseveral long, ginger cat hairs
	chapter thirteengryffindor versus ravenclawit looked like the end of ron and hermione's friendship
	each was soangry with the other that harry couldn't see how they'd ever make up
	ron was enraged that hermione had never taken crookshanks's attempts toeat scabbers seriously, hadn't bothered to keep a close enough watch onhim, and was still trying to pretend that crookshanks was innocent bysuggesting that ron look for scabbers under all the boys' beds
	hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that ron had no proof thatcrookshanks had eaten scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have beenthere since christmas, and that ron had been prejudiced against her catever since crookshanks had landed on ron's head in the magicalmenagerie
	personally, harry was sure that crookshanks had eaten scabbers, and whenhe tried to point out to hermione that the evidence all pointed thatway, she lost her temper with harry too
	okay, side with ron, i knew you would she said shrilly
	first thefirebolt, now scabbers, everything's my fault, isn't it just leave mealone, harry, i've got a lot of work to doron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed
	come on, ron, you were always saying how boring scabbers was, saidfred bracingly
	and he's been offcolor for ages, he was wasting away
	it was probably better for him to snuff it quickly  one swallow  heprobably didn't feel a thing
	fred said ginny indignantly
	all he did was eat and sleep, ron, you said it yourself, said george
	he bit goyle for us once ron said miserably
	remember, harryyeah, that's true, said harry
	his finest hour, said fred, unable to keep a straight face
	let thescar on goyle's finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory
	oh,come on, ron, get yourself down to hogsmeade and buy a new rat, what'sthe point of moaningin a lastditch attempt to cheer ron up, harry persuaded him to comealong to the gryffindor team's final practice before the ravenclawmatch, so that he could have a ride on the firebolt after they'dfinished
	this did seem to take ron's mind off scabbers for a momentgreat can i try and shoot a few goals on it so they set off forthe quidditch field together
	madam hooch, who was still overseeing gryffindor practices to keep aneye on harry, was just as impressed with the firebolt as everyone elsehad been
	she took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them thebenefit of her professional opinion
	look at the balance on it if the nimbus series has a fault, it's aslight list to the tail end  you often find they develop a drag aftera few years
	they've updated the handle too, a bit slimmer than thecleansweeps, reminds me of the old silver arrows  a pity they'vestopped making them
	i learned to fly on one, and a very fine old broomit was too
	she continued in this vein for some time, until wood said, er  madamhooch is it okay if harry has the firebolt back we need topractice
	oh  right  here you are, then, potter, said madam hooch
	i'll sitover here with weasley
	she and ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and the gryffindorteam gathered around wood for his final instructions for tomorrow'smatch
	harry, i've just found out who ravenclaw is playing as seeker
	she's a fourth year, and she's pretty good
	i really hoped shewouldn't be fit, she's had some problems with injuries
	wood scowledhis displeasure that cho chang had made a full recovery, then said, onthe other hand, she rides a comet two sixty, which is going to look likea joke next to the firebolt
	he gave harry's broom a look of ferventadmiration, then said, okay, everyone, let's go  and at long last, harry mounted his firebolt, and kicked off from theground
	it was better than he'd ever dreamed
	the firebolt turned with thelightest touch it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip itsped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into agreenandgray blur harry turned it so sharply that alicia spinnetscreamed, then he went into a perfectly controlled dive, brushing thegrassy field with his toes before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet intothe air again
	harry, i'm letting the snitch out wood called
	harry turned and raced a bludger toward the goal posts he outstrippedit easily, saw the snitch dart out from behind wood, and within tenseconds had caught it tightly in his hand
	the team cheered madly
	harry let the snitch go again, gave it aminute's head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of theothers he spotted it lurking near katie bell's knee, looped her easily,and caught it again
	it was the best practice ever the team, inspired by the presence of thefirebolt in their midst, performed their best moves faultlessly, and bythe time they hit the ground again, wood didn't have a single criticismto make, which, as george weasley pointed out, was a first
	i can't see what's going to stop us tomorrow said wood
	not unless harry, you've sorted out your dementor problem, haven't youyeah, said harry, thinking of his feeble patronus and wishing it werestronger
	the dementors won't turn up again, oliver
	dumbledore'd go ballistic,said fred confidently
	well, let's hope not, said wood
	anyway  good work, everyone
	let'sget back to the tower
	turn in early i'm staying out for a bit ron wants a go on the firebolt, harry toldwood, and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms,harry strode over to ron, who vaulted the barrier to the stands and cameto meet him
	madam hooch had fallen asleep in her seat
	here you go, said harry, handing ron the firebolt
	ron, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom and zoomedoff into the gathering darkness while harry walked around the edge ofthe field, watching him
	night had fallen before madam hooch awoke witha start, told harry and ron off for not waking her, and insisted thatthey go back to the castle
	harry shouldered the firebolt and he and ron walked out of the shadowystadium, discussing the firebolt's superbly smooth action, itsphenomenal acceleration, and its pinpoint turning
	they were halfwaytoward the castle when harry, glancing to his left, saw something thatmade his heart turn over  a pair of eyes, gleaming out of thedarkness
	harry stopped dead, his heart banging against his ribs
	what's the matter said ron
	ron pulled out his wand and muttered, lumosa beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of a tree, andilluminated its branches there, crouching among the budding leaves, wascrookshanks
	get out of here ron roared, and he stooped down and seized a stonelying on the grass, but before he could do anything else, crookshankshad vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail
	see ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again
	she's stillletting him wander about wherever he wants  probably washing downscabbers with a couple of birds now
	harry didn't say anything
	he took a deep breath as relief seepedthrough him he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belongedto the grim
	they set off for the castle once more
	slightly ashamed ofhis moment of panic, harry didn't say anything to ron  nor did he lookleft or right until they had reached the welllit entrance hall
	harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boysin his dormitory, all of whom seemed to think the firebolt deserved asort of guard of honor
	as harry entered the great hall, heads turned inthe direction of the firebolt, and there was a good deal of excitedmuttering
	harry saw, with enormous satisfaction, that the slytherinteam were all looking thunderstruck
	did you see his face said ron gleefully, looking back at malfay
	hecan't believe it this is brilliantwood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the firebolt
	put it here, harry, he said, laying the broom in the middle of thetable and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward
	peoplefrom the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look
	cedric diggory came over to congratulate harry on having acquired such asuperb replacement for his nimbus, and percy's ravenclaw girlfriend,penelope clearwater, asked if she could actually hold the firebolt
	now, now, penny, no sabotage said percy heartily as she examined thefirebolt closely
	penelope and i have got a bet on, he told the team
	ten galleons on the outcome of the matchpenelope put the firebolt down again, thanked harry, and went back toher table
	harry  make sure you win, said percy, in an urgent whisper
	ihaven't got ten galleons
	yes, i'm coming, penny andhe bustled off tojoin her in a piece of toast
	sure you can manage that broom, potter said a cold, drawling voice
	draco malfoy had arrived for a closer look, crabbe and coyle rightbehind him
	yeah, reckon so, said harry casually
	got plenty of special features, hasn't it said malfoy, eyesglittering maliciously
	shame it doesn't come with a parachute  incase you get too near a dementor
	crabbe and goyle sniggered
	pity you can't attach an extra arm to yours, malfoy, said harry
	thenit could catch the snitch for you
	the gryffindor team laughed loudly
	malfoy's pale eyes narrowed, and hestalked away
	they watched him rejoin the rest of the slytherin team,who put their heads together, no doubt asking malfoy whether harry'sbroom really was a firebolt
	at a quarter to eleven, the gryffindor team set off for the lockerrooms
	the weather couldn't have been more different from their matchagainst hufflepuff
	it was a clear, cool day with a very light breezethere would be no visibility problems this time, and harry, thoughnervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a quidditch matchcould bring
	they could hear the rest of the school moving into thestadium beyond
	harry took off his black school robes, removed his wandfrom his pocket, and stuck it inside the tshirt he was going to wearunder his quidditch robes
	he only hoped he wouldn't need it
	hewondered suddenly whether professor lupin was in the crowd, watching
	you know what we've got to do, said wood as they prepared to leave thelocker rooms
	if we lose this match, we're out of the running
	just just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we'll be okaythey walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause
	the ravenclawteam, dressed in blue, were already standing in the middle of the field
	their seeker, cho chang, was the only girl on their team
	she wasshorter than harry by about a head, and harry couldn't help noticing,nervous as he was, that she was extremely pretty
	she smiled at harry asthe teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slightlurch in the region of his stomach that he didn't think had anything todo with nerves
	wood, davies, shake hands, madam hooch said briskly, and wood shookhands with the ravenclaw captain
	three  two  one harry kicked off into the air and the firebolt zoomed higher and fasterthan any other broom he soared around the stadium and began squintingaround for the snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, whichwas being provided by the weasley twins' friend lee jordan
	they're off, and the big excitement this match is the firebolt thatharry potter is flying for gryffindor
	according to which broomstick,the firebolt's going to be the broom of choice for the national teams atthis year's world championship jordan, would you mind telling us what's going on in the matchinterrupted professor mcgonagall's voice
	right you are, professor  just giving a bit of background information the firebolt, incidentally, has a builtin autobrake and jordanokay, okay, gryffindor in possession, katie bell of gryffindor, headingfor goal
	harry streaked past katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for aglint of gold and noticing that cho chang was tailing him closely
	shewas undoubtedly a very good flier  she kept cutting across him,forcing him to change direction
	show her your acceleration, harry fred yelled as he whooshed past inpursuit of a bludger that was aiming for alicia
	harry urged the firebolt forward as they rounded the ravenclaw goalposts and cho fell behind
	just as katie succeeded in scoring the firstgoal of the match, and the gryffindor end of the field went wild, he sawit  the snitch was close to the ground, flitting near one of thebarriers
	harry dived cho saw what he was doing and tore after him  harry wasspeeding up, excitement flooding him dives were his speciality, he wasten feet away then a bludger, hit by one of the ravenclaw beaters, came pelting out ofnowhere harry veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in thosefew, crucial seconds, the snitch had vanished
	there was a great ooooooh of disappointment from the gryffindorsupporters, but much applause for their beater from the ravenclaw end
	george weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second bludgerdirectly at the offending beater, who was forced to roll right over inmidair to avoid it
	gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that fireboltgo potter's really putting it through its paces now, see it turn chang's comet is just no match for it, the firebolt's precision balanceis really noticeable in these long jordan are you being paid to advertise firebolts get on with thecommentaryravenclaw was pulling back they had now scored three goals, which putgryffindor only fifty points ahead  if cho got the snitch before him,ravenclaw would win
	harry dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a ravenclawchaser, scanning the field frantically  a glint of gold, a flutter oftiny wings  the snitch was circling the gryffindor goal post harry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead  but justthen, cho appeared out of thin air, blocking him harry, this is no time to be a gentleman wood roared as harry swervedto avoid a collision
	knock her off her broom if you have toharry turned and caught sight of cho she was grinning
	the snitch hadvanished again
	harry turned his firebolt upward and was soon twentyfeet above the game
	out of the corner of his eye, he saw cho followinghim
	she'd decided to mark him rather than search for the snitchherself
	if she wanted to tail him, she'd have totake the consequences
	he dived again, and cho, thinking he'd seen the snitch, tried to followharry pulled out of the dive very sharply she hurtled downward he rosefast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time  thesnitch was glittering way above the field at the ravenclaw end
	he accelerated so, many feet below, did cho
	he was winning, gaining onthe snitch with every second  then oh screamed cho, pointing
	distracted, harry looked down
	three dementors, three tall, black, hooded dementors, were looking up athim
	he didn't stop to think
	plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, hewhipped out his wand and roared, expecto patronumsomething silverwhite, something enormous, erupted from the end of hiswand
	he knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didn't pause towatch his mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead  he wasnearly there
	he stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and justmanaged to close his fingers over the small, struggling snitch
	madam hooch's whistle sounded
	harry turned around in midair and saw sixscarlet blurs bearing down on him next moment, the whole team washugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom
	down below hecould hear the roars of the gryffindors in the crowd
	that's my boy wood kept yelling
	alicia, angelina, and katie had allkissed harry fred had him in a grip so tight harry felt as though hishead would come off in complete disarray, the team managed to make itsway back to the ground
	harry got off his broom and looked up to see agaggle of gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field, ron in thelead
	before he knew it, he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd
	yes ron yelled, yanking harry's arm into the air
	yes yeswell done, harry said percy, looking delighted
	ten galleons to memust find penelope, excuse me good for you, harry roared seamus finnigan
	ruddy brilliant boomed hagrid over the heads of the millinggryffindors
	that was quite some patronus, said a voice in harry's ear
	harry turned around to see professor lupin, who looked both shaken andpleased
	the dementors didn't affect me at all harry said excitedly
	i didn'tfeel a thingthat would be because they  er  weren't dementors, said professorlupin
	come and see  he led harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge ofthe field
	malfoy quite a fright, said lupin
	lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were malfoy,crabbe, goyle, and marcus flint, the slytherin team captain, allstruggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes
	itlooked as though malfoy had been standing on goyle's shoulders
	standingover them, with an expression of the utmost fury on her face, wasprofessor mcgonagall
	an unworthy trick she was shouting
	a low and cowardly attempt tosabotage the gryffindor seeker detention for all of you, and fiftypoints from slytherin i shall be speaking to professor dumbledore aboutthis, make no mistake ah, here he comes nowif anything could have set the seal on gryffindor's victory, it wasthis
	ron, who had fought his way through to harry's side, doubled upwith laughter as they watched malfoy fighting to extricate himself fromthe robe, goyle's head still stuck inside it
	come on, harry said george, fighting his way over
	party gryffindorcommon room, nowright, said harry, and feeling happier than he had in ages, he and therest of the team led the way, still in their scarlet robes, out of thestadium and back up to the castle
	it felt as though they had already won the quidditch cup the party wenton all day and well into the night
	fred and george weasley disappearedfor a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles ofbutterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of honeydukes sweets
	how did you do that squealed angelina johnson as george startedthrowing peppermint toads into the crowd
	with a little help from moony, wormtail, padfoot, and prongs, fredmuttered in harry's ear
	only one person wasn't joining in the festivities
	hermione, incredibly,was sitting in a corner, attempting to read an enormous book entitledhome life and social habits of british muggles
	harry broke away fromthe table where fred and george had started juggling butterbeer bottlesand went over to her
	did you even come to the match he asked her
	of course i did, said hermione in a strangely highpitched voice, notlooking up
	and i'm very glad we won, and i think you did really well,but i need to read this by monday
	come on, hermione, come and have some food, harry said, looking overat ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury thehatchet
	i've still got four hundred and twentytwo pages toread said hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical
	sheglanced over at ron too
	he doesn't want me to join in
	there was no arguing with this, as ron chose that moment to say loudly,if scabbers hadn't just been eaten, he could have had some of thosefudge flies
	he used to really like them hermione burst into tears
	before harry could say or do anything, shetucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran towardthe staircase to the girls' dormitories and out of sight
	can't you give her a break harry asked ron quietly
	if she just acted like she was sorry  butshe'll never admit she's wrong, hermione
	she's still acting likescabbers has gone on vacation or something
	the gryffindor party ended only when professor mcgonagall turned up inher tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning, to insistthat they all go to bed
	harry and ron climbed the stairs to theirdormitory, still discussing the match
	at last, exhausted, harry climbedinto bed, twitched the hangings of his fourposter shut to block out aray of moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly driftingoff to sleep
	he had a very strange dream
	he was walking through a forest, hisfirebolt over his shoulder, following something silverywhite
	it waswinding its way through the trees ahead, and he could only catchglimpses of it between the leaves
	anxious to catch up with it, he spedup, but as he moved faster, so did his quarry
	harry broke into a run,and ahead he heard hooves gathering speed
	now he was running flat out,and ahead he could hear galloping
	then he turned a corner into aclearing and aaarrgghh noooharry woke as suddenly as though he'd been hit in the face
	disorientedin the total darkness, he fumbled with his hangings, he could hearmovements around him, and seamus finnigan's voice from the other side ofthe room what's going onharry thought he heard the dormitory door slam
	at last finding thedivide in his curtains, he ripped them back, and at the same moment,dean thomas lit his lamp
	ron was sitting up in bed, the hangings torn from one side, a look ofutmost terror on his face
	black sirius black with a knifewhathere just now slashed the curtains woke me upyou sure you weren't dreaming, ron said dean
	look at the curtains i tell you, he was herethey all scrambled out of bed harry reached the dormitory door first,and they sprinted back down the staircase
	doors opened behind them, andsleepy voices called after them
	who shoutedwhat're you doingthe common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire, still litteredwith the debris from the party
	are you sure you weren't dreaming, roni'm telling you, i saw himwhat's all the noiseprofessor mcgonagall told us to go to beda few of the girls had come down their staircase, pulling or, dressinggowns and yawning
	boys, too, were reappearing
	excellent, are we carrying on said fred weasley brightly
	everyone back upstairs said percy, hurrying into the common room andpinning his head boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke
	perce  sirius black said ron faintly
	in our dormitory with aknife woke me upthe common room went very still
	nonsense said percy, looking startled
	you had too much to eat, ron had a nightmare i'm telling you now, really, enough's enoughprofessor mcgonagall was back
	she slammed the portrait behind her asshe entered the common room and stared furiously around
	i am delighted that gryffindor won the match, but this is gettingridiculous percy, i expected better of youi certainly didn't authorize this, professor said percy, puffinghimself up indignantly
	i was just telling them all to get back to bedmy brother ron here had a nightmare it wasn't a nightmare ron yelled
	professor, i woke up, and siriusblack was standing over me, holding a knifeprofessor mcgonagall stared at him
	don't be ridiculous, weasley, how could he possibly have gotten throughthe portrait holeask him said ron, pointing a shaking finger at the back of sircadogan's picture
	ask him if he saw glaring suspiciously at ron, professor mcgonagall pushed the portraitback open and went outside
	the whole common room listened with batedbreath
	sir cadogan, did you just let a man enter gryffindor towercertainly, good lady cried sir cadogan
	there was a stunned silence, both inside and outside the common room
	you  you did said professor mcgonagall
	but  but the passwordhe had 'em said sir cadogan proudly
	had the whole week's, my ladyread 'em off a little piece of paperprofessor mcgonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole toface the stunned crowd
	she was white as chalk
	which person, she said, her voice shaking, which abysmally foolishperson wrote down this week's passwords and left them lying aroundthere was utter silence, broken by the smallest of terrified squeaks
	neville longbottom, trembling from head to fluffy slippered toes, raisedhis hand slowly into the air
	chapter fourteensnape's grudgeno one in gryffindor tower slept that night
	they knew that the castlewas being searched again, and the whole house stayed awake in the commonroom, waiting to hear whether black had been caught
	professormcgonagall came back at dawn, to tell them that he had again escaped
	throughout the day, everywhere they went they saw signs of tightersecurity professor flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors torecognize a large picture of sirius black filch was suddenly bustlingup and down the corridors, boarding up everything from tiny cracks inthe walls to mouse holes
	sir cadogan had been fired
	his portrait hadbeen taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the fatlady was back
	she had been expertly restored, but was still extremelynervous, and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that shewas given extra protection
	a bunch of surly security trolls had beenhired to guard her
	they paced the corridor in a menacing group, talkingin grunts and comparing the size of their clubs
	harry couldn't help noticing that the statue of the oneeyed witch onthe third floor remained unguarded and unblocked
	it seemed that fredand george had been right in thinking that they  and now harry, ron,and hermione  were the only ones who knew about the hidden passagewaywithin it
	d'you reckon we should tell someone harry asked ron
	we know he's not coming in through honeyduke's, said ron dismissively
	we'd've heard if the shop had been broken into
	harry was glad ron took this view
	if the oneeyed witch was boarded uptoo, he would never be able to go into hogsmeade again
	ron had become an instant celebrity
	for the first time in his life,people were paying more attention to him than to harry, and it was clearthat ron was rather enjoying the experience
	though still severelyshaken by the night's events, he was happy to tell anyone who asked whathad happened, with a wealth of detail
	i was asleep, and i heard this ripping noise, and i thought it wasin my dream, you know but then there was this draft
	i woke up andone side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down
	and i saw him standing over me
	like a skeleton, with loads offilthy hair
	holding this great long knife, must've been twelveinches
	and he looked at me, and i looked at him, and then i yelled,and he scampered
	why, though ron added to harry as the group of secondyear girls whohad been listening to his chilling tale departed
	why did he runharry had been wondering the same thing
	why had black, having got thewrong bed, not silenced ron and proceeded to harry black had provedtwelve years ago that he didn't mind murdering innocent people, and thistime he had been facing five unarmed boys, four of whom were asleep
	he must've known he'd have a job getting back out of the castle onceyou'd yelled and woken people up, said harry thoughtfully
	he'd've hadto kill the whole house to get back through the portrait hole
	then hewould' ve met the teachers
	neville was in total disgrace
	professor mcgonagall was so furious withhim she had banned him from all future hogsmeade visits, given him adetention, and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower
	poor neville was forced to wait
	outside the common room every night forsomebody to let him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly athim
	none of these punishments, however, came close to matching the onehis grandmother had in store for him
	two days after black's breakin,she sent neville the very worst thing a hogwarts student could receiveover breakfast  a howler
	the school owls swooped into the great hall carrying the mail as usual,and neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him, a scarletenvelope clutched in its beak
	harry and ron, who were sitting oppositehim, recognized the letter as a howler at once  ron had got one fromhis mother the year before
	run for it, neville, ron advised
	neville didn't need telling twice
	he seized the envelope, and holdingit before him like a bomb, sprinted out of the hall, while the slytherintable exploded with laughter at the sight of him
	they heard the howlergo off in the entrance hall  neville's grandmother's voice, magicallymagnified to a hundred times its usual volume, shrieking about how hehad brought shame on the whole family
	harry was too busy feeling sorry for neville to notice immediately thathe had a letter too
	hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply onthe wrist
	ouch oh  thanks, hedwig
	harry tore open the envelope while hedwig helped herself to some ofneville's cornflakes
	the note inside saiddear harry and ron, how abut having tea with me this afternoon 'roundsix i'll come collect you from the castle
	wait for me in the entrancehall you're not allowed out on your own
	cheers, hagridhe probably wants to hear all about black said ron
	so at six o'clock that afternoon, harry and ron left gryffindor tower,passed the security trolls at a run, and headed down to the entrancehall
	hagrid was already waiting for them
	all right, hagrid said ron
	s'pose you want to hear about saturdaynight, do youi've already heard all abou' it, said hagrid, opening the front doorsand leading them outside
	oh, said ron, looking slightly put out
	the first thing they saw on entering hagrid's cabin was buckbeak, whowas stretched out on top of hagrid's patchwork quilt, his enormous wingsfolded tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets
	averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight, harry saw a gigantic,hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellowandorange tie hanging fromthe top of hagrid's wardrobe door
	what are they for, hagrid said harry
	buckbeaks case against the committee fer the disposal o' dangerouscreatures, said hagrid
	him an' me'll be goin' down terlondon together
	i've booked two beds on the knight bus
	harry felt a nasty pang of guilt
	he had completely forgotten thatbuckbeak's trial was so near, and judging by the uneasy look on ron'sface, he had too
	they had also forgotten their promise about helpinghim prepare buckbeak's defense the arrival of the firebolt had drivenit clean out of their minds
	hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of bath buns but theyknew better than to accept they had had too much experience withhagrid's cooking
	i got somethin' ter discuss with you two, said hagrid, sitting himselfbetween them and looking uncharacteristically serious
	hermione, said hagrid
	what about her said ron
	she's in a righ' state, that's what
	she's bin comin' down ter visit mea lot since chris'mas
	firs' yeh weren' talking toher because o' the firebolt, now yer not talkin' to her because her cat ate scabbers ron interjected angrily
	because her cat acted like all cats do, hagrid continued doggedly
	she's cried a fair few times, yeh know
	goin' through a rough time atthe moment
	bitten off more'n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the workshe's tryin' ter do
	still found time ter help me with buckbeak's case,mind
	she's found some really good stuff fer me
	reckon he'll standa good chance now
	hagrid, we should've helped as well  sorry  harry began awkwardly
	i'm not blamin' yeh said hagrid, waving harry's apology aside
	gawdknows yeh've had enough ter be gettin' on with
	i've seen yeh practicin'quidditch ev'ry hour o' the day an' night  but i gotta tell yeh, ithought you two'd value yer friend more'n broomsticks or rats
	harry and ron exchanged uncomfortable looks
	really upset, she was, when black nearly stabbed yeh, ron
	she's gother heart in the right place, hermione has, an' you two not talkin' toher if she'd just get rid of that cat, i'd speak to her again ron saidangrily
	but she's still sticking up for it it's a maniac, and shewon't hear a word against itah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou' their pets, said hagridwisely
	behind him, buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto hagrid'spillow
	they spent the rest of their visit discussing gryffindor's improvedchances for the quidditch cup
	at nine o'clock, hagrid walked them backup to the castle
	a large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when theyreturned to the common room
	hogsmeade, next weekend said ron, craning over the heads to read thenew notice
	what d'you reckon he added quietly to harry as they wentto sit down
	well, filch hasn't done anything about the passage into honeydukes
	harry said, even more quietly
	harry said a voice in his right ear
	harry started and looked aroundat hermione, who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearinga space in the wall of books that had been hiding her
	harry, if you go into hogsmeade again
	i'll tell professor mcgonagallabout that map said hermione
	can you hear someone talking, harry growled ron, not looking athermione
	ron, how can you let him go with you after what sirius black nearlydid to you i mean it, i'll tell so now you're trying to get harry expelled said ron furiously
	haven't you done enough damage this yearhermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, crookshanksleapt onto her lap
	hermione took one frightened look at the expressionon ron's face, gathered up crookshanks, and hurried away toward thegirls' dormitories
	so how about it ron said to harry as though there had been nointerruption
	come on, last time we went you didn't see anything
	youhaven't even been inside zonko's yetharry looked around to check that hermione was well out of earshot
	but i'm taking the invisibility cloak this time
	on saturday morning, harry packed his invisibility cloak in his bag,slipped the marauder's map into his pocket, and went down to breakfastwith everyone else
	hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down thetable at him, but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see himwalking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybodyelse proceeded to the front doors
	'bye harry called to ron
	see you when you get backron grinned and winked
	harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the marauder's map out ofhis pocket as he went
	crouching behind the oneeyed witch, he smoothedit out
	a tiny dot was moving in his direction
	harry squinted at it
	the minuscule writing next to it read neville longbottom
	harry quickly pulled out his wand, muttered, dissendium and shovedhis bag into the statue, but before he could climb in himself, nevillecame around the corner
	harry i forgot you weren't going to hogsmeade eitherhi, neville, said harry, moving swiftly away from the statue andpushing the map back into his pocket
	what are you up tonothing, shrugged neville
	want a game of exploding snaper  not now  i was going to go to the library and do that vampireessay for lupin i'll come with you said neville brightly
	i haven't done it eitherer  hang on  yeah, i forgot, i finished it last nightgreat, you can help me said neville, his round face anxious
	i don'tunderstand that thing about the garlic at all  do they have to eat it,or he broke off with a small gasp, looking over harry's shoulder
	neville took a quick step behind harry
	and what are you two doing here said snape, coming to a halt andlooking from one to the other
	an odd place to meet to harry's immense disquiet, snape's black eyes flicked to the doorwayson either side of them, and then to the oneeyed witch
	we're not  meeting here, said harry
	you have a habit of turning up in unexpectedplaces, potter, and you are very rarely there for no good reason
	isuggest the pair of you return to gryffindor tower, where you belong
	harry and neville set off without another word
	as they turned thecorner, harry looked back
	snape was running one of his hands over theoneeyed witch's head, examining it closely
	harry managed to shake neville off at the fat lady by telling him thepassword, then pretending he'd left his vampire essay in the library anddoubling back
	once out of sight of the security trolls, he pulled outthe map again and held it close to his nose
	the third floor corridor seemed to be deserted
	harry scanned the mapcarefully and saw, with a leap of relief, that the tiny dot labeledseverus snape was now back in its office
	he sprinted back to the oneeyed witch, opened her hump, heaved himselfinside, and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute
	he wiped the marauder's map blank again, then set off at a run
	harry, completely hidden beneath the invisibility cloak, emerged intothe sunlight outside honeydukes and prodded ron in the back
	what kept you ron hissed
	snape was hanging around
	they set off up the high street
	where are you ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth
	areyou still there this feels weird
	they went to the post office ron pretended to be checking the price ofan owl to bill in egypt so that harry could have a good look around
	theowls sat hooting softly down at him, at least three hundred of themfrom great grays right down to tiny little scops owls local deliveriesonly, which were so small they could have sat in the palm of harry'shand
	then they visited zonko's, which was so packed with students harry hadto exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic
	therewere jokes and tricks to fulfill even fred's and george's wildestdreams harry gave ron whispered orders and passed him some gold fromunder the cloak
	they left zonko's with their money bags considerablylighter than they had been on entering, but their pockets bulging withdungbombs, hiccup sweets, frog spawn soap, and a nosebiting teacupapiece
	the day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt like stayingindoors, so they walked past the three broomsticks and climbed a slopeto visit the shrieking shack, the most haunted dwelling in britain
	itstood a little way above the rest of the village, and even in daylightwas slightly creepy, with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden
	even the hogwarts ghosts avoid it, said ron as they leaned on thefence, looking up at it
	i asked nearly headless nick
	he says he'sheard a very rough crowd lives here
	fred and georgetried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut
	harry, feeling hot from their climb, was just considering taking off thecloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby
	someone wasclimbing toward the house from the other side of the hill momentslater, malfoy had appeared, followed closely by crabbe and goyle
	should have an owl from father any time now
	he had to go to thehearing to tell them about my arm
	about how i couldn't use it forthree months
	crabbe and goyle sniggered
	i really wish i could hear that great hairy moron trying to defendhimself
	'there's no 'arm in 'im, 'onest that hippogriff's as good asdead malfoy suddenly caught sight of ron
	his pale face split in a malevolentgrin
	what are you doing, weasleymalfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind ron
	suppose you'd love to live here, wouldn't you, weasley dreaming abouthaving your own bedroom i heard your family all sleep in one room  isthat trueharry seized the back of ron's robes to stop him from leaping on malfoy
	leave him to me, he hissed in ron's ear
	the opportunity was too perfect to miss
	harry crept silently aroundbehind malfoy, crabbe, and goyle, bent down, and scooped a large handfulof mud out of the path
	we were just discussing your friend hagrid, malfoy said to ron
	justtrying to imagine what he's saying to the committee for the disposal ofdangerous creatures
	d'you think he'll cry when they cut off hishippogriff'ssplat
	malfoy's head jerked forward as the mud hit him his silverblond hairwas suddenly dripping in muck
	what the ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing, he was laughingso hard
	malfoy, crabbe, and goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staringwildly around, malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean
	what was that 'who did thatvery haunted up here, isn't it said ron, with the air of onecommenting on the weather
	crabbe and goyle were looking scared
	their bulging muscles were no useagainst ghosts
	malfoy was staring madly around at the desertedlandscape
	harry sneaked along the path, where a particularly sloppy puddle yieldedsome foulsmelling, green sludge
	crabbe and goyle caught some this time
	goyle hopped furiously on thespot, trying to rub it out of his small, dull eyes
	it came from over there said malfoy, wiping his face, and staring ata spot some six feet to the left of harry
	crabbe blundered forward, his long arms outstretched like a zombie
	harry dodged around him, picked up a stick, and lobbed it at crabbe'sback
	harry doubled up with silent laughter as crabbe did a kind ofpirouette in midair, trying to see who had thrown it
	as ron was theonly person crabbe could see, it was ron he started toward, but harrystuck out his leg
	crabbe stumbled  and his huge, flat foot caught thehem of harry's cloak
	harry felt a great tug, then the cloak slid offhis face
	for a split second, malfoy stared at him
	aaargh he yelled, pointing at harry's head
	then he turned tail andran, at breakneck speed, back down the hill, crabbe and goyle behindhim
	harry tugged the cloak up again, but the damage was done
	harry ron said, stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the pointwhere harry had disappeared, you'd better run for it if malfoy tellsanyone  you'd better get back to the castle, quick  see youlater, said harry, and without another word, he tore back down the pathtoward hogsmeade
	would malfoy believe what he had seen would anyone believemalfoy nobody knew about the invisibility cloak  nobody exceptdumbledore
	harry's stomach turned over  dumbledore would know exactlywhat had happened, if malfoy said any thing back into honeydukes, back down the cellar steps, across the stonefloor, through the trapdoor  harry pulled off the cloak, tucked itunder his arm, and ran, flat out, along the passage
	malfoy would getback first
	how long would it take him to find a teacher panting, asharp pain in his side, harry didn't slow down until he reached thestone slide
	he would have to leave the cloak where it was, it was toomuch of a giveaway in case malfoy had tipped off a teacher  he hid itin a shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast as he could, his sweatyhands slipping on the sides of the chute
	he reached the inside of thewitch's hump, tapped it with his wand, stuck his head through, andhoisted himself out the hump closed, and just as harry jumped out frombehind the statue, he heard quick footsteps approaching
	he approached harry at a swift walk, his black robesswishing, then stopped in front of him
	there was a look of surpressed triumph about him
	harry tried to lookinnocent, all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands, which hequickly hid in his pockets
	come with me, potter, said snape
	harry followed him downstairs, trying to wipe his hands clean on theinside of his robes without snape noticing
	they walked down the stairsto the dungeons and then into snape's office
	harry had been in here only once before, and he had been in very serioustrouble then too
	snape had aquired a few more slimy horrible things injars since last time, all standing on shelves behind his desk, glintingin the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere
	snape, however, remained, standing
	malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, potter, saidsnape
	harry didn't say anything
	he tells me that he was up by the shrieking shack when he ran intoweasley  apparently alone
	still, harry didn't speak
	malfoy states that he was standing talking to weasley, when a largeamount of mud hit him in the back of the head
	how do you think thatcould have happenedharry tried to look mildly surprised
	i don't know, professor
	snape's eyes were boring into harry's
	it was exactly like trying tostare down a hippogriff
	harry tried hard not to blink
	malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition
	can you imagine whatit might have been, potterno, said harry, now trying to sound innocently curious
	it was your head, potter
	there was a long silence
	maybe he'd better go to madam pomfrey, said harry
	if he's seeingthings like what would your head have been doing in hogsmeade, potter said snapesoftly
	your head is not allowed in hogsmeade
	no part of your body haspermission to be in hogsmeade
	i know that, said harry, striving to keep his face free of guilt orfear
	it sounds like malfoy's having hallucin malfoy is not having hallucinations, snarled snape, and he bent down,a hand on each arm of harry's chair, so that their faces were a footapart
	if your head was in hogsmeade, so was the rest of you
	i've been up in gryffindor tower, said harry
	like you told  cananyone confirm thatharry didn't say anything
	snape's thin mouth curled into a horriblesmile
	so, he said, straightening up again
	everyone from the minister ofmagic downward has been trying to keep famous harry potter safe fromsirius black
	but famous harry potter is a law unto himself let theordinary people worry about his safety famous harry potter goes wherehe wants to, with no thought for the consequences
	snape was trying to provoke him into telling thetruth
	he wasn't going to do it
	snape had no proof  yet
	how extraordinarily like your father you are, potter, snape saidsuddenly, his eyes glinting
	he too was exceedingly arrogant
	a smallamount of talent on the quidditch field made him think he was a cutabove the rest of us too
	strutting around the place with his friendsand admirers
	the resemblance between you is uncanny
	my dad didn't strut, said harry, before he could stop himself
	your father didn't set much store by rules either, snape went on,pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice
	rules were forlesser mortals, not quidditch cupwinners
	his head was so swollen shut upharry was suddenly on his feet
	rage such as he had not felt since hislast night in privet drive was coursing through him
	he didn't care thatsnape's face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing dangerously
	what did you say to me, potteri told you to shut up about my dad harry yelled
	i know the truth,all right he saved your life dumbledore told me you wouldn't even behere if it wasn't for my dadsnape's sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk
	and did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your fathersaved my life he whispered
	or did he consider the details toounpleasant for precious potter's delicate earsharry bit his lip
	he didn't know what had happened and didn't want toadmit it  but snape seemed to have guessed the truth
	i would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father,potter, he said, a terrible grin twisting his face
	have you beenimagining some act of glorious heroism then let me correct you  yoursaintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me thatwould have resulted in my death if your father hadn't got cold feet atthe last moment
	there was nothing brave about what he did
	he wassaving his own skin as much as mine
	had their joke succeeded, he wouldhave been expelled from hogwarts
	snape's uneven, yellowish teeth were bared
	turn out your pockets, potter he spat suddenly
	there was a pounding in his ears
	turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the headmaster pull themout, pottercold with dread, harry slowly pulled out the bag of zonko's tricks andthe marauder's map
	snap picked up the zonko's bag
	ron gave them to me, said harry, praying he'd get a chance to tip ronoff before snape saw him
	he brought them back from hogsmeade lasttime indeed and you've been carrying them around ever since how verytouching
	and what is thissnape had picked up the map
	harry tried with all his might to keep hisface impassive
	spare bit of parchment, he said with a shrug
	snape turned it over, his eyes on harry
	surely you don't need such a very old piece of parchment he said
	why don't i just  throw this awayhis hand moved toward the fire
	no harry said quickly
	so said snape, his long nostrils quivering
	is this anothertreasured gift from mr
	weasley or is it  something else a letter,perhaps, written in invisible ink or  instructions to get intohogsmeade without passing the dementorsharry blinked
	snape's eyes gleamed
	let me see, let me see
	he muttered, taking out his wand andsmoothing the map out on his desk
	reveal your secret he said,touching the wand to the parchment
	harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking
	show yourself snape said, tapping the map sharply
	harry was taking deep, calming breaths
	professor severus snape, master of this school, commands you to yieldthe information you conceal snape said, hitting the map with his wand
	as though an invisible hand were writing upon it, words appeared on thesmooth surface of the map
	mooney presents his compliments to professor snape, and begs him to keephis abnormally large nose out of other people's business
	harry stared, dumbstruck, at the message
	but the mapdidn't stop there
	more writing was appearing beneath the first
	prongs agrees with mr
	moony and would like to add that professorsnape is an ugle git
	it would have been very funny if the situation hadn't been so serious
	padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot likethat ever became a professor
	harry closed his eyes in horror
	when he'd opened them, the map had hadits last word
	wormtail bids professor snape good day, and advises him to wash hishair , the slimeball
	harry waited for the blow to fall
	we'll see about this
	he strode across to his fire, seized a fistful of glittering powder froma jar on the fireplace, and threw it into the flames
	lupin snape called into the fire
	i want a wordutterly bewildered, harry stared at the fire
	a large shape had appearedin it, revolving very fast
	seconds later, professor lupin wasclambering out of the fireplace, brushing ash off his shabby robes
	you called, severus said lupin mildly
	i certainly did, said snape, his face contorted with fury as he strodeback to his desk
	i have just asked potter to empty his pockets
	snape pointed at the parchment, on which the words of messrs
	moony,wormtail, padfoot, and prongs were still shining
	an odd, closedexpression appeared on lupin's face
	lupin continued to stare at the map
	harry had the impression that lupinwas doing some very quick thinking
	well said snape again
	this parchment is plainly full of dark magic
	this is supposed to be your area of expertise, lupin
	where do youimagine potter got such a thinglupin looked up and, by the merest halfglance in harry's direction,warned him not to interrupt
	full of dark magic he repeated mildly
	do you really think so,severus it looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment thatinsults anybody who reads it
	childish, but surely not dangerous iimagine harry got it from a joke shop indeed said snape
	his jaw had gone rigid with anger
	you think ajoke shop could supply him with such a thing you don't think it morelikely that he got it directly from the manufacturersharry didn't understand what snape was talking about
	nor, apparently,did lupin
	wormtail or one of these people he said
	harry, doyou know any of these menno, said harry quickly
	you see, severus said lupin, turning back to snape
	it looks like azonko product to me right on cue, ron came bursting into the office
	he was completely outof breath, and stopped just short of snape's desk, clutching the stitchin his chest and trying to speak
	i  gave  harry  that  stuff, he choked
	well said lupin, clapping his hands together and looking aroundcheerfully
	that seems to clear that up severus, i'll take this back,shall i he folded the map and tucked it inside his robes
	harry, ron,come with me, i need a word about my vampire essay  excuse us, severusharry didn't dare look at snape as they left his office
	ron, andlupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking
	then harry turned to lupin
	professor, i i don't want to hear explanations, said lupin shortly
	he glancedaround the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice
	i happen to knowthat this map was confiscated by mr
	filch many years ago
	yes, i knowit' s a map, he said as harry and ron looked amazed
	i don't want toknow how it fell into your possession
	i am, however, astounded that youdidn't hand it in
	particularly after what happened the last time astudent left information about the castle lying around
	and i can't letyou have it back, harry
	harry had expected that, and was too keen for explanations to protest
	why did snape think i'd got it from the manufacturersbecause
	, lupin hesitated, because these mapmakers would havewanted to lure you out of school
	they'd think it extremelyentertaining
	do you know them said harry, impressed
	we've met, he said shortly
	he was looking at harry more seriouslythan ever before
	don't expect me to cover up for you again, harry
	i cannot make youtake sirius black seriously
	but i would have thought that what you haveheard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effecton you
	your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, harry
	a poorway to repay them  gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magictricks
	he walked away, leaving harry feeling worse by far than he had at anypoint in snape's office
	slowly, he and ron mounted the marblestaircase
	as harry passed the oneeyed witch, he remembered theinvisibility cloak  it was still down there, but he didn't dare go andget it
	it's my fault, said ron abruptly
	i persuaded you to go
	lupin'sright, it was stupid, we shouldn't've done it he broke off they reached the corridor where the security trolls werepacing, and hermione was walking toward them
	one look at her faceconvinced harry that she had heard what had happened
	his heartplummeted  had she told professor mcgonagallcome to have a good gloat said ron savagely as she stopped in frontof them
	or have you just been to tell on usno, said hermione
	she was holding a letter in her hands and her lipwas trembling
	i just thought you ought to know
	buckbeak is going to be executed
	chapter fifteenthe quidditch finalhe sent me this, hermione said, holding out the letter
	the parchment was damp, and enormous teardrops hadsmudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to read
	dear hermione, we lost
	i'm allowed to bring him back to hogwarts
	execution date to be fixed
	beaky has enjoyed london
	i won't forget allthe help you gave us
	hagridthey can't do this, said harry
	buckbeak isn'tdangerous
	malfoy's dad's frightened the committee into it, said hermione, wipingher eyes
	you know what he's like
	they're a bunch of doddery oldfools, and they were scared
	there'll be an appeal, though, there alwaysis
	only i can't see any hope
	nothing will have changed
	yeah, it will, said ron fiercely
	you won't have to do all the workalone this time, hermione
	oh, ronhermione flung her arms around ron's neck and broke down completely
	ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top ofthe head
	finally, hermione drew away
	ron, i'm really, really sorry about scabbers
	oh  well  he was old, said ron, looking thoroughly relieved thatshe had let go of him
	and he was a bit useless
	you never know, mumand dad might get me an owl now
	the safety measures imposed on the students since black's secondbreakin made it impossible for harry, ron, and hermione to go and visithagrid in the evenings
	their only chance of talking to him was duringcare of magical creatures lessons
	he seemed numb with shock at the verdict
	they was all sittin' there inblack robes an' i kep' droppin' me notes and forgettin' all them datesyeh looked up fer me, hermione
	an' then lucius malfoy stood up an' saidhis bit, and the committee jus' did exac'ly what he told 'em
	there's still the appeal said ron fiercely
	don't give up yet, we'reworking on itthey were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the class
	ahead they could see malfoy, who was walking with crabbe and goyle, andkept looking back, laughing derisively
	s'no good, ron, said hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps
	that committee's in lucius malfoy's pocket
	i'm jus' gonna make surethe rest o' beaky's time is the happiest he's ever had
	hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin, his face buriedin his handkerchief
	look at him blubbermalfoy, crabbe, and goyle had been standing just inside the castledoors, listening
	have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic said malfoy
	and he'ssupposed to be our teacherharry and ron both made furious moves toward malfoy, but hermione gotthere first  smackshe had slapped malfoy across the face with all the strength she couldmuster
	harry, ron, crabbe, and goyle stoodflabbergasted as hermione raised her hand again
	don't you dare call hagrid pathetic, you foul  you evil hermione said ron weakly, and he tried to grab her hand as she swungit back
	get off, ronhermione pulled out her wand
	malfoy stepped backward
	crabbe and goylelooked at him for instructions, thoroughly bewildered
	c'mon, malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three of them haddisappeared into the passageway to the dungeons
	hermione ron said again, sounding both stunned and irnpressed
	harry, you'd better beat him in the quidditch final hermione saidshrilly
	you just better had, because i can't stand it if slytherinwinswe're due in charms, said ron, still goggling at hermione
	they hurried up the marble staircase toward professor flitwick'sclassroom
	you're late, boys said professor flitwick reprovingly as harry openedthe classroom door
	come along, quickly, wands out, we're experimentingwith cheering charms today, we've already divided into pairs harry and ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags
	ronlooked behind him
	where's hermione goneharry looked around too
	hermione hadn't entered the classroom, yetharry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the door
	that's weird, said harry, staring at ron
	maybe  maybe she went tothe bathroom or somethingbut hermione didn't turn up all lesson
	she could've done with a cheering charm on her too, said ron as theclass left for lunch, all grinning broadly  the cheering charms hadleft them with a feeling of great contentment
	hermione wasn't at lunch either
	by the time they had finished theirapple pie, the aftereffects of the cheering charms were wearing off,and harry and ron had started to get slightly worried
	you don't think malfoy did something to her ron said anxiously asthey hurried upstairs toward gryffindor tower
	they passed the security trolls, gave the fat lady the passwordflibbertigibbet, and scrambled through the portrait hole into thecommon room
	hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head resting on anopen arithmancy book
	they went to sit down on either side of her
	harryprodded her awake
	wh  what said hermione, waking with a start and staring wildlyaround
	is it time to go w  which lesson have we got nowdivination, but it's not for another twenty minutes, said harry
	hermione, why didn't you come to charmswhat oh no hermione squeaked
	i forgot to go to charmsbut how could you forget said harry
	you were with us till we wereright outside the classroomi don't believe it hermione wailed
	was professor flitwick angryoh, it was malfoy, i was thinking about him and i lost track of thingsyou know what, hermione said ron, looking down at the enormousarithmancy book hermione had been using as a pillow
	i reckon you'recracking up
	you're trying to do too much
	no, i'm not said hermione, brushing her hair out of her eyes andstaring hopelessly around for her bag
	i just made a mistake, that'sall i'd better go and see professor flitwick and say sorry
	i'll seeyou in divinationhermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to professor trelawneysclassroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely harrassed
	i can't believe i missed cheering charms and i bet they come up in ourexams professor flitwick hinted they mighttogether they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room
	glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly whitemist
	harry, ron, and hermione sat down together at the same ricketytable
	i thought we weren't starting crystal balls until next term, ronmuttered, casting a wary eye around for professor trelawney, in case shewas lurking nearby
	don't complain, this means we've finished palmistry, harry mutteredback
	i was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at myhands
	good day to you said the familiar, misty voice, and professortrelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows
	parvatiand lavender quivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky glowof their crystal ball
	i have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than ihad planned, said professor trelawney, sitting with her back to thefire and gazing around
	the fates have informed me that yourexamination in june will concern the orb, and i am anxious to give yousufficient practice
	'the fates have informed her' who sets the exam shedoes what an amazing prediction she said, not troubling to keep hervoice low
	harry and ron choked back laughs
	it was hard to tell whether professor trelawney had heard them as herface was hidden in shadow
	she continued, however, as though she hadnot
	crystal gazing is a particularly refined art, she said dreamily
	i donot expect any of you to see when first you peer into the orb's infinitedepths
	we shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind andexternal eyes  ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuffhis fist in his mouth to stifle the noise  so as to clear the innereye and the superconscious
	perhaps, if we are lucky, some of you willsee before the end of the class
	harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staringblankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep his mind empty when thoughtssuch as this is stupid kept drifting across it
	it didn't help thatron kept breaking into silent giggles and hermione kept tutting
	seen anything yet harry asked them after a quarter of an hour's quietcrystal gazing
	yeah, there's a burn on this table, said ron, pointing
	someone'sspilled their candle
	this is such a waste of time, hermione hissed
	i could be practicingsomething useful
	i could be catching up on cheering charms professor trelawney rustled past
	would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents withintheir orb she murmured over the clinking of her bangles
	i don't need help, ron whispered
	it's obvious what this means
	there's going to be loads of fog tonight
	both harry and hermione burst out laughing
	now, really said professor trelawney as everyone's heads turned intheir direction
	parvati and lavender were looking scandalized
	you aredisturbing the clairvoyant vibrations she approached their table andpeered into their crystal ball
	harry felt his heart sinking
	he wassure he knew what was coming there is something here professor trelawney whispered, lowerng herface to the ball, so that it was reflected twice in her huge glasses
	but what is itharry was prepared to bet everything he owned, including his firebolt,that it wasn't good news, whatever it was
	and sure enough my dear professor trelawney breathed, gazing up at harry
	it is here,plainer than ever before
	my dear, stalking toward you, growing evercloser
	the gr oh, for goodness' sake said hermione loudly
	not that ridiculousgrim againprofessor trelawney raised her enormous eyes to hermione's face
	parvatiwhispered something to lavender, and they both glared at hermione too
	professor trelawney stood up, surveying hermione with unmistakableanger
	i am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this classmy dear, it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art ofdivination requires
	indeed, i don't remember ever meeting a studentwhose mind was so hopelessly mundane
	there was a moment's silence
	then fine said hermione suddenly, getting up and cramming unfogging thefuture back into her bag
	fine she repeated, swinging the bag overher shoulder and almost knocking ron off his chair
	i give up i'mleavingand to the whole class's amazement, hermione strode over to thetrapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed down the ladder out of sight
	it took a few minutes for the class to settle down again
	professortrelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the grim
	she turnedabruptly from harry and ron's table, breathing rather heavily as shetugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her
	ooooo said lavender suddenly, making everyone start
	ooooo,professor trelawney, i've just remembered you saw her leaving, didn'tyou didn't you, professor 'around easter, one of our number will leaveus forever' you said it ages ago, professorprofessor trelawney gave her a dewy smile
	yes, my dear, i did indeed know that miss granger would be leaving us
	one hopes, however, that one might have mistaken the signs
	the innereye can be a burden, you know
	lavender and parvati looked deeply impressed, and moved over so thatprofessor trelawney could join their table instead
	some day hermione's having, eh ron muttered to harry, looking awed
	harry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling whitemist
	had professor trelawney really seen the grim again would he thelast thing he needed was another nearfatal accident, with the quidditchfinal drawing ever nearer
	the easter holidays were not exactly relaxing
	the third years had neverhad so much homework
	neville longbottom seemed close to a nervouscollapse, and he wasn't the only one
	call this a holiday seamus finnigan roared at the common room oneafternoon
	the exams are ages away, what're they playing atbut nobody had as much to do as hermione
	even without divination, shewas taking more subjects than anybody else
	she was usually last toleave the common room at night, first to arrive at the library the nextmorning she had shadows like lupin's under her eyes, and seemedconstantly close to tears
	ron had taken over responsibility for buckbeak's appeal
	when he wasn'tdoing his own work, he was poring over enormously thick volumes withnames like the handbook of hippogriff psychology and fowl or foul astudy of hippogriff brutality
	he was so absorbed, he even forgot to behorrible to crookshanks
	harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around quidditch practiceevery day, not to mention endless discussions of tactics with wood
	thegryffindorslytherin match would take place on the first saturday afterthe easter holidays
	slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly twohundred points
	this meant as wood constantly reminded his team thatthey needed to win the match by more than that amount to win the cup
	italso meant that the burden of winning fell largely on harry, becausecapturing the snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points
	so you must catch it only if we're more than fifty points up, woodtold harry constantly
	only if we're more than fifty points up, harry,or we win the match but lose the cup
	you've got that, haven't you youmust catch the snitch only if we're i know, oliver harry yelled
	the whole of gryffindor house was obsessed with the coming match
	gryffindor hadn't won the quidditch cup since the legendary charlieweasley ron's second oldest brother had been seeker
	but harry doubtedwhether any of them, even wood, wanted to win as much as he did
	theenmity between harry and malfoy was at its highest point ever
	malfoywas still smarting ,bout the mudthrowing incident in hogsmeade and waseven more furious that harry had somehow wormed his way out ofpunishment
	harry hadn't forgotten malfoy's attempt to sabotage him inthe match against ravenclaw, but it was the matter of buckbeak that madehim most determined to beat malfoy in front of the entire school
	never, in anyone's memory, had a match approached in such a highlycharged atmosphere
	by the time the holidays were over, tension betweenthe two teams and their houses was at the breaking point
	a number ofsmall scuffles broke out in the corridors, culminating in a nastyincident in which a gryffindor fourth year and a slytherin sixth yearended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears
	harry was having a particularly bad time of it
	he couldn't walk toclass without slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip himup crabbe and goyle kept popping up wherever he went, and slouchingaway looking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people
	woodhad given instructions that harry should be accompanied everywhere hewent, in case the slytherins tried to put him out of action
	the wholeof gryffindor house took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that itwas impossible for harry to get to classes on time because he wassurrounded by a vast, chattering crowd
	harry was more concerned for hisfirebolt's safety than his own
	when he wasn't flying it, he locked itsecurely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to gryffindor towerat break times to check that it was still there
	all usual pursuits were abandoned in the gryffindor common room thenight before the match
	even hermione had put down her books
	i can't work, i can't concentrate, she said nervously
	there was a great deal of noise
	fred and george weasley were dealingwith the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than ever
	oliverwood was crouched over a model of a quidditch field in the corner,prodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himselfangelina, alicia, and katie were laughing at fred's and george's jokes
	harry was sitting with ron and hermione, removed from the center ofthings, trying not to think about the next day, because every time hedid, he had the horrible sensation that something very large wasfighting to get out of his stomach
	you're going to be fine, hermione told him, though she lookedpositively terrified
	you've got a firebolt said ron
	said harry, his stomach writhing
	it came as a relief when wood suddenly stood up and yelled, team bedharry slept badly
	first he dreamed that he had overslept, and that woodwas yelling, where were you we had to use neville instead then hedreamed that malfoy and the rest of the slytherin team arrived for thematch riding dragons
	he was flying at breakneck speed, trying to avoida spurt of flames from malfoy's steed's mouth, when he realized he hadforgotten his firebolt
	he fell through the air and woke with a start
	it was a few seconds before harry remembered that the match hadn't takenplace yet, that he was safe in bed, and that the slytherin teamdefinitely wouldn't be allowed to play on dragons
	he was feeling verythirsty
	quietly as he could, he got out of his fourposter and went topour himself some water from the silver jug beneath the window
	the grounds were still and quiet
	no breath of wind disturbed thetreetops in the forbidden forest the whomping willow was motionless andinnocentlooking
	it looked as though the conditions for the match wouldbe perfect
	harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed whensomething caught his eye
	an animal of some kind was prowling across thesilvery lawn
	harry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his glasses, and put themon, then hurried back to the window
	it couldn't be the grim  not now not right before the match he peered out at the grounds again and, after a minute's franticsearching, spotted it
	it was skirting the edge of the forest now
	itwasn't the grim at all
	harry clutched the windowledge in relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail
	it was onlycrookshanks
	or was it only crookshanks harry squinted, pressing his nose flatagainst the glass
	crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt
	harry wassure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too
	and just then, it emerged  a gigantic, shaggy black dog, movingstealthily across the lawn, crookshanks trotting at its side
	what did this mean if crookshanks could see the dog as well,how could it be an omen of harry's deathron harry hissed
	ron wake uphuhi need you to tell me if you can see somethings'all dark, harry, ron muttered thickly
	what're you or, aboutdown here harry looked quickly back out of the window
	crookshanks and the dog had vanished
	harry climbed onto the windowsillto look right down into the shadows of the castle, but they weren'tthere
	where had they gonea loud snore told him ron had fallen asleep again
	harry and the rest of the gryffindor team entered the great hall thenext day to enormous applause
	harry couldn't help grinning broadly ashe saw that both the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables were applaudingthem too
	the slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed
	harrynoticed that malfoy looked even paler than usual
	wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while touchingnothing himself then he hurried them off to the field before anyone elsehad finished, so they could get an idea of the conditions
	as they leftthe great hall, everyone applauded again
	good luck, harry called cho
	harry felt himself blushing
	okay  no wind to speak of  sun's a bit bright, that could impairyour vision, watch out for it  ground's fairly hard, good, that'llgive us a fast kickoff wood paced the field, staring around with the team behind him
	finally,they saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the restof the school spilling onto the lawn
	locker rooms, said wood tersely
	none of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes
	harrywondered if they were feeling like he was as though he'd eatensomething extremely wriggly for breakfast
	in what seemed like no timeat all, wood was saying, okay, it's time, let's go they walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise
	threequartersof the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with thegryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like gogryffindor and lions for the cuk' behind the slytherin goal posts,however, two hundred people were wearing green the silver serpent ofslytherin glittered on their flags, and professor snape sat in the veryfront row, wearing green like everyone else, and a very grim smile
	and here are the gryffindors yelled lee jordan, who was acting ascommentator as usual
	potter, bell, johnson, spinnet, weasley, weasley,and wood
	widely acknowledged as the best team hogwarts has seen in agood few years lee's comments were drowned by a tide of boos from the slytherin end
	and here come the slytherin team, led by captain flint
	he's made somechanges in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skillmore boos from the slytherin crowd
	harry, however, thought lee had apoint
	malfoy was easily the smallest person on the slytherin team therest of them were enormous
	captains, shake hands said madam hooch
	flint and wood approached each other and grasped each other's hand verytightly it looked as though each was trying to break the other'sfingers
	mount your brooms said madam hooch
	the sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteenbrooms rose into the air
	harry felt his hair fly back off his foreheadhis nerves left him in the thrill of the flight he glanced around, sawmalfoy on his tail, and sped off in search of the snitch
	and it's gryffindor in possession, alicia spinner of gryffindor withthe quaffle, heading straight for the slytherin goal posts, lookinggood, alicia argh, no  quaffle intercepted by warrington, warringtonof slytherin tearing up the field  wham  nice bludger work there bygeorge weasley, warrington drops the quaffle, it's caught by  johnson,gryffindor back in possession, come on, angelina  nice swerve aroundmontague  duck, angelina, that's a bludger she scores tenzero togryffindorangelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the field thesea of scarlet below was screaming its delightouchangelina was nearly thrown from her broom as marcus flint went smashinginto her

	yes she's beaten the keeper twentyzero to gryffindorharry turned the firebolt sharply to watch flint, still bleeding freely,fly forward to take the slytherin penalty
	wood was hovering in front ofthe gryffindor goal posts, his jaw clenched
	'course, wood's a superb keeper lee jordan told the crowd as flintwaited for madam hooch's whistle
	superb very difficult to pass very difficult indeed  yes i don't believe it he's saved itrelieved, harry zoomed away, gazing around for the snitch, but stillmaking sure he caught every word of lee's commentary

	katie cart wheeled in theair, managed to stay on her broom, but dropped the quaffle
	madam hooch's whistle rang out again as she soared over to montague andbegan shouting at him
	a minute later, katie had put another penaltypast the slytherin seeker
	thirtyzero take that, you dirty, cheating jordan, if you can't commentate in an unbiased way i'm telling it like it is, professorharry felt a huge jolt of excitement
	he had seen the snitch it wasshimmering at the foot of one of the gryffindor goal posts  but hemustn't catch it yet  and if malfoy saw it faking a look of sudden concentration, harry pulled his firebolt aroundand sped off toward the slytherin end  it worked
	malfoy went haringafter him, clearly thinking harry had seen the snitch there
	one of the bludgers came streaking past harry's right ear, hit by thegigantic slytherin beater, derrick
	the second bludger grazed harry's elbow
	the other beater, bole, wasclosing in
	harry had a fleeting glimpse of bole and derrick zooming toward him,clubs raised he turned the firebolt upward at the last second, and bole and derrickcollided with a sickening crunch
	ha haaa yelled lee jordan as the slytherin beaters lurched away fromeach other, clutching their heads
	too bad, boys you'll need to get upearlier than that to beat a firebold and it's gryffindor in possessionagain, as johnson takes the quaffle  flint alongside her  poke himin the eye, angelina  it was a joke, professor, it was a joke  ohno  flint in possession, flint flying toward the gryffindor goalposts, come on now, wood, save but flint had scored there was an eruption of cheers from the slytherinend, and lee swore so badly that professor mcgonagall tried to tug themagical megaphone away from him
	sorry, professor, sorry woia happen again so, gryffindor in the lead,thirty points to ten, and gryffindor in possession it was turning into the dirtiest game harry had ever played in
	enragedthat gryffindor had taken such an early lead, the slytherins wererapidly resorting to any means to take the quaffle
	bole hit alicia withhis club and tried to say he'd thought she was a bludger
	george weasleyelbowed bole in the face in retaliation
	madam hooch awarded both teamspenalties, and wood pulled off another spectacular save, making thescore fortyten to gryffindor
	the snitch had disappeared again
	malfoy was still keeping close toharry as he soared over the match, looking around for it once gryffindorwas fifty points ahead katie scored
	fred and george weasley were swooping aroundher, clubs raised, in case any of the slytherins were thinking ofrevenge
	bole and derrick took advantage of fred's and george's absenceto aim both bludgers at wood they caught him in the stomach, one afterthe other, and he rolled over in the air, clutching his broom,completely winded
	madam hooch was beside herselfyou do not attack the keeper unless the quaffle is within the scoringarea she shrieked at bole and derrick
	gryffindor penaltyand angelina scored
	moments later, fred weasley pelted abludger at warrington, knocking the quaffle out of his hands aliciaseized it and put it through the slytherin goal  seventyten
	the gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse  gryffindor wassixty points in the lead, and if harry caught the snitch now, the cupwas theirs
	harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him as hesoared around the field, high above the rest of the game, with malfoyspeeding along behind him
	the snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him
	harry put on a huge burst of speed the wind was roaring in his ears hestretched out his hand, but suddenly, the firebolt was slowing down horrified, he looked around
	malfoy had thrown himself forward, grabbedhold of the firebolt's tail, and was pulling it back
	you harry was angry enough to hit malfoy, but couldn't reach  malfoy waspanting with the effort of holding onto the firebolt, but his eyes weresparkling maliciously
	he had achieved what he'd wanted to do  thesnitch had disappeared again
	penalty penalty to gryffindor i've never seen such tactics
	madamhooch screeched, shooting up to where malfoy was sliding back onto hisnimbus two thousand and one
	you cheating scum lee jordan was howling into the megaphone, dancingout of professor mcgonagall's reach
	you filthy, cheating b pprofessor mcgonagall didn't even bother to tell him off she wasactually shaking her finger in malfoys direction, her hat had fallenoff, and she too was shouting furiously
	alicia took gryffindor's penalty, but she was so angry she missed byseveral feet
	the gryffindor team was losing concentration and theslytherins, delighted by malfoy's foul on harry, were being spurred onto greater heights
	slytherin in possession, slytherin heading for goal  montague scores lee groaned
	seventy twenty to gryffindor
	harry was now marking malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting eachother
	harry wasn't going to let malfoy anywhere near the snitch
	get out of it, potter malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried toturn and found harry blocking him
	angelina johnson gets the quaffle for gryffindor, come on, angelina,come onharry looked around
	every single slytherin player apart from malfoy wasstreaking up the pitch toward angelina, including the slytherin keeper they were all going to block her harry wheeled the firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat alongthe handle, and kicked it forward
	like a bullet, he shot toward theslytherins
	aaaaaaarrrghthey scattered as the firebolt zoomed toward them angelina's way wasclear
	she scores she scores gryffindor leads by eighty points to twentyharry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a haltin midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field
	and then he saw something to make his heart stand still
	malfoy wasdiving, a look of triumph on his face  there, a few feet above thegrass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer harry urged the firebolt downward, but malfoy was miles ahead go go go harry urged his broom
	he was gaining on malfay  harryflattened himself to the broom handle as bole sent a bludger at him he was at malfoy's ankles  he was level harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his broom
	he knockedmalfoy's arm out of the way and yeshe pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the stadiumexploded
	harry soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in his ears
	thetiny golden ball was held tight in his fist, beating its wingshopelessly against his fingers
	then wood was speeding toward him, halfblinded by tears he seizedharry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder
	harryfelt two large thumps as fred and george hit them then angelina's,alicia's, and katie's voices, we've won the cup we've won the cuptangled together in a manyarmed hug, the gryffindor team sank, yellinghoarsely, back to earth
	wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers ontothe field
	hands were raining down on their backs
	harry had a confusedimpression of noise and bodies pressing in on him
	then he, and the restof the team, were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd
	thrust intothe light, he saw hagrid, plastered with crimson rosettes  yeh beat'em, harry, yeh beat 'emwait till i tell buckbeak there was percy, jumping up and down like amaniac, all dignity forgotten
	professor mcgonagall was sobbing hardereven than wood, wiping her eyes with an enormous gryffindor flag andthere, fighting their way toward harry, were ron and hermione
	they simply beamed as harry was borne toward the stands,where dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous quidditch cup
	if only there had been a dementor around
	as a sobbing wood passedharry the cup, as he lifted it into the air, harry felt he could haveproduced the world's best patronus
	chapter sixteenprofessor trelawney's predictionharry's euphoria at finally winning the quidditch cup lasted at least aweek
	even the weather seemed to be celebrating as june approached, thedays became cloudless and sultry, and all anybody felt like doing wasstrolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with severalpints of iced pumpkin juice, perhaps playing a casual game of gobstonesor watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface ofthe lake
	exams were nearly upon them, and instead of lazingaround outside, the students were forced to remain inside the castle,trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts ofsummer air drifted in through the windows
	even fred and george weasleyhad been spotted working they were about to take their o
	sordinary wizarding levels
	percy was getting ready to take hisn
	s nastily exhausting wizarding tests, the highestqualification hogwarts offered
	as percy hoped to enter the ministry ofmagic, he needed top grades
	he was becoming increasingly edgy, and gavevery severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the commonroom in the evenings
	in fact, the only person who seemed more anxiousthan percy was hermione
	harry and ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attendseveral classes at once, but they couldn't restrain themselves when theysaw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself
	the first columnreadmonday9 o'clock, arithmancy9 o'clock, transfigurationlunch1 o'clock, charms1 o'clock, ancient runeshermione ron said cautiously, because she was liable to explode wheninterrupted these days
	er  are you sure you've copied down thesetimes rightwhat snapped hermione, picking up the exam schedule and examining it
	yes, of course i have
	is there any point asking how you're going to sit for two exams atonce said harry
	no, said hermione shortly
	have either of you seen my copy ofnumerology and gramaticaoh, yeah, i borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading, said ron, butvery quietly
	hermione started shifting heaps of parchment harry, ron,and hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to hagrid
	beaky's gettin' a bit depressed, hagrid told them, bending low on thepretense of checking that harry's flobberworm was still alive
	bincooped up too long
	we'll know day after tomorrow  oneway or the other they had potions that afternoon, which was an unqualified disaster
	tryas harry might, he couldn't get his confusing concoction to thicken, andsnape, standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure, scribbledsomething that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes beforemoving away
	then came astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower history ofmagic on wednesday morning, in which harry scribbled everything floreanfortescue had ever told him about medieval witchhunts, while wishing hecould have had one of fortescue's choconut sundaes with him in thestifling classroom
	wednesday afternoon meant herbology, in thegreenhouses under a bakinghot sun then back to the common room oncemore, with sunburnt necks, thinking longingly of this time next day,when it would all be over
	their second to last exam, on thursday morning, was defense against thedark arts
	professor lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any ofthem had ever taken a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun, wherethey had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylow,cross a series of potholes full of red caps, squish their way across apatch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk,then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggart
	excellent, harry, lupin muttered as harry climbed out of the trunk,grinning
	flushed with his success, harry hung around to watch ron and hermione
	ron did very well until he reached the hinkypunk, which successfullyconfused him into sinking waisthigh into the quagmire
	hermione dideverything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the boggart in it
	after about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming
	hermione said lupin, startled
	what's the matterp  p  professor mcgonagall hermione gasped, pointing into thetrunk
	sh  she said i'd failed everythingit took a little while to calm hermione down
	when at last she hadregained a grip on herself, she, harry, and ron went back to the castle
	ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at hermione's boggart, but anargument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps
	cornelius fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak, was standingthere staring out at the grounds
	he started at the sight of harry
	hello there, harry he said
	just had an exam, i expect nearlyfinishedyes, said harry
	hermione and ron, not being on speaking terms withthe minister of magic, hovered awkwardly in the background
	lovely day, said fudge, casting an eye over the lake
	he sighed deeply and looked down at harry
	i'm here on an unpleasant mission, harry
	the committee for thedisposal of dangerous creatures required a witness to the execution of amad hippogriff
	as i needed to visit hogwarts to check on the blacksituation, i was asked to step in
	does that mean the appeal's already happened ron interrupted,stepping forward
	no, no, it's scheduled for this afternoon, said fudge, lookingcuriously at ron
	then you might not have to witness an execution at a said eonstoutly
	the hippogriff might get offbefore fudge could answer, two wizards came through the castle doorsbehind him
	one was so ancient he appeared to be withering before theirvery eyes the other was tall and strapping, with a thin back mustache
	harry gathered that they were representatives of the committee for thedisposal of dangerous creatures, because tie very old wizard squintedtoward hagrid's cabin and said in a feeble voice, dear, dear, i'mgetting too old for this
	two o'clock, isn't it, fudgethe blackmustached man was fingering something in his belt harrylooked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of ashining axe
	ron opened his mouth to say something, but hermione nudgedhim hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall
	why'd you stop me said ron angrily as they entered the great hall forlunch
	did you see them they've even got the axe ready this isn'tjusticeron, your dad works for the ministry, you can't go saying things likethat to his boss said hermione, but she too looked very upset
	aslong as hagrid keeps his head this time, and argue, hi case properly,they can't possibly execute buckbeak
	but harry could tell hermione didn't really believe what she was saying
	all around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch,happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but harry,ron, and hermione, lost in worry about hagrid and buckbeak, didn't joinin
	harry's and ron's last exam was divination hermione's, muggle studies
	they walked up the marble staircase together hermione left them on thefirst floor and harry and ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh,where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase toprofessor trelawney's classroom, trying to cram in a bit of lastminutestudying
	she's seeing us all separately, neville informed them as they went tosit down next to him
	he had his copy of unfogging the future open onhis lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing
	have either of you everseen anything in a crystal ball he asked them unhappily
	nope, said ron in an offhand voice
	he kept checking his watch harry
	knew that he was counting down the time until buckbeak's appeal started
	the line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly
	as eachperson climbed back down the silver ladder, the rest of the classhissed, what did she ask was it okaybut they all refused to say
	she says the crystal ball's told her that if i tell you, i'll have ahorrible accident squeaked neville as he clambered back down theladder toward harry and ron, who had now reached the landing
	that's convenient, snorted ron
	you know, i'm starting to thinkhermione was right about her  he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdooroverhead  she's a right old fraud
	yeah, said harry, looking at his own watch
	itwas now two o'clock
	parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride
	she says i've got all the makings of a true seer, she informed harryand ron
	i saw loads of stuff
	well, good luckshe hurried off down the spiral staircase toward lavender
	ronald weasley, said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads
	ron grimaced at harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight
	harrywas now the only person left to be tested
	he settled himself on thefloor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in thesunny window, his mind across the grounds with hagrid
	finally, after about twenty minutes, ron's large feet reappeared on theladder
	how'd it go harry asked him, standing up
	couldn't see a thing, so i made some stuff up
	don't think she was convinced, though
	meet you in the common room, harry muttered as professor trelawney'svoice called, harry potterthe tower room was hotter than ever before the curtains were closed,the fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made harry cough as hestumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where professortrelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball
	good day, my dear, she said softly
	if you would kindly gaze into theorb
	then tell me what you see within it
	harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could,willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, butnothing happened
	well professor trelawney prompted delicately
	what do you seethe heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with theperfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them
	he thought of what ronhad just said, and decided to pretend
	er  said harry, a dark shape
	what does it resemble whispered professor trelawney
	harry cast his mind around and it landed on buckbeak
	a hippogriff, he said firmly
	indeed whispered professor trelawney, scribbling keenly on theparchment perched upon her knees
	my boy, you may well be seeing theoutcome of poor hagrid's trouble with the ministry of magic lookcloser
	does the hippogriff appear to
	have its headyes, said harry firmly
	are you sure professor trelawney urged him
	are you quite sure,dear you don't see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowyfigure raising an axe behind itno said harry, starting to feel slightly sick
	no blood no weeping hagridno said harry again, wanting more than ever to leave the room and theheat
	it looks fine, it's   flying away
	professor trelawney sighed
	well, dear, i think we'll leave it there
	a little disappointing
	but i'm sure you did your best
	relieved, harry got up, picked up his bag and turned to go, but then aloud, harsh voice spoke behind him
	it will happen tonight
	professor trelawney had gone rigid in herarmchair her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging
	but professor trelawney didn't seem to hear him
	her eyes started toroll
	harry sat there in a panic
	she looked as though she was about tohave some sort of seizure
	he hesitated, thinking of running to thehospital wing  and then professor trelawney spoke again, in the sameharsh voice, quite unlike her ownthe dark lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by his followers
	his servant has been chained these twelve years
	tonight, beforemidnight
	the servant will break free and set out to rejoin hismaster
	the dark lord will rise again with his servants aid, greater andmore terrible than ever he was
	professor trelawney's head fell forward onto her chest
	she made agrunting sort of noise
	harry sat there, staring at her
	then, quitesuddenly, professor trelawney's head snapped up again
	i'm so sorry, dear boy, she said dreamily, the heat of the day, youknow
	i drifted off for a moment
	harry sat there, staring at her
	is there anything wrong, my dearyou  you just told me that the  the dark lord's going to riseagain
	that his servant's going to go back to him
	professor trelawney looked thoroughly startled
	the dark lord hewhomustnotbenamed my dear boy, that's hardlysomething to joke about
	rise again, indeed ,'but you just said it you
	said the dark lord i think you must have dozed off too, dear said professor trelawney
	i would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as farfetchedas thatharry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase,wondering
	had he just heard professor trelawney make a realprediction or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the testfive minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside theentrance to gryffindor tower, professor trelawney's words stillresounding in his head
	people were striding past him in the oppositedirection, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a bit oflongawaited freedom by the time he had reached the portrait hole andentered the common room, it was almost deserted
	over in the corner,however, sat ron and hermione
	professor trelawney, harry panted, just told me but he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces
	buckbeak lost, said ron weakly
	hagrid's just sent this
	hagrid's note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet hishand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardlylegible
	they're going to execute at sunset
	i don't want you to see it
	hagridwe've got to go, said harry at once
	he can't just sit there on hisown, waiting for the executionersunset, though, said ron, who was staring out the window ill a glazedsort of way
	we'd never be allowed
	'specially you, harry
	harry sank his head into his hands, thinking
	if we only had the invisibility cloak
	where is it said hermione
	harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the oneeyedwitch
	if snape sees me anywhere near there again, i'm in serioustrouble, he finished
	that's true, said hermione, getting to her feet
	how do you open the witch's hump againyou  you tap it and say, 'dissendium,' said harry
	but hermione didn't wait for the rest of his sentence she strode across theroom, pushed open the fat lady's portrait and vanished from sight
	she hasn't gone to get it ron said, staring after her
	hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silverycloak folded carefully under her robes
	hermione, i don't know what's gotten, into you lately said ron,astounded
	first you hit malfoy, then you walk out on professortrelawney hermione looked rather flattered
	they went down to dinner with everybody else, but did not return togryffindor tower afterward
	harry had the cloak hidden down tie front ofhis robes he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump
	they skulkedin an empty chamber off the entrance hall, listening, until they weresure it was deserted
	they heard a last pair of people hurrying acrossthe hall and a door slamming
	hermione poked her head around the door
	okay, she whispered, no one there  cloak on walking very close together so that nobody would see them, they crossedthe hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak, then walked down the stone frontsteps into the grounds
	the sun was already sinking behind the forbiddenforest, gilding the top branches of the trees
	they reached hagrid's cabin and knocked
	he was a minute in answering,and when he did, he looked all around for his visitor, palefaced andtrembling
	it's us, harry hissed
	we're wearing the invisibility cloak
	let usin and we can take it off
	yeh shouldn've come hagrid whispered, but he stood back, and theystepped inside
	hagrid shut the door quickly and harry pulled off thecloak
	hagrid was not crying, nor did he throw himself upon their necks
	helooked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do
	thishelplessness was worse to watch than tears
	wan' some tea he said
	his great hands were shaking as he reached forthe kettle
	where's buckbeak, hagrid said hermione hesitantly
	i  i took him outside, said hagrid, spilling milk all over the tableas he filled up the jug
	he's tethered in me pumpkin patch
	thought heoughta see the trees an'  an' smell fresh air  beforehagrid's hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from hisgrasp and shattered all over the floor
	i'll do it, hagrid, said hermione quickly, hurrying over and startingto clean up the mess
	there's another one in the cupboard, hagrid said, sitting down andwiping his forehead on his sleeve
	harry glanced at ron, who looked backhopelessly
	isn't there anything anyone can do, hagrid harry asked fiercely,sitting down next to him
	dumbledore he's tried, said hagrid
	he's got no power ter overrule thecommittee
	he told 'em buckbeak's all right, but they're scared
	yehknow what lucius malfoy's like
	threatened 'em, i expect
	an' theexecutioner, macnair, he's an old pal o' malfoy's
	but it'll be quickan' clean
	an' i'll be beside him
	his eyes were darting all over the cabin as thoughlooking for some shred of hope or comfort
	dumbledore's gonna come down while it  while it happens
	wrote methis mornin'
	said he wants ter  ter be with me
	great man,dumbledore
	hermione, who had been rummaging in hagrid's cupboard for another milkjug, let out a small, quickly stifled sob
	she straightened up with thenew jug in her hands, fighting back tears
	we'll stay with you too, hagrid, she began, but hagrid shook hisshaggy head
	yeh're ter go back up ter the castle
	i told yeh, i don' wan' yehwatchin'
	an' yeh shouldn' be down here anyway
	if fudge an'dumbledore catch yeh out without permission, harry, yeh'll be in bigtrouble
	silent tears were now streaming down hermione's face, but she hid themfrom hagrid, bustling around making tea
	then, as she picked up the milkbottle to pour some into the jug, she let out a shriek
	ron, i don't believe it  it's scabbersron gaped at her
	what are you talking abouthermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upsidedown
	with a frantic squeak, and much scrambling to get back inside,scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table
	scabbers said ron blankly
	scabbers, what are you doing herehe grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light
	scabberslooked dreadful
	he was thinner than ever, large tufts of hair hadfallen out leaving wide bald patches, and he writhed in ron's hands asthough desperate to free himselfit's okay, scabbers said ron
	no cats there's nothing here to hurtyouhagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the window
	his normallyruddy face had gone the color of parchment
	harry, ron, and hermione whipped around
	a group of men was walking downthe distant castle steps
	in front was albus dumbledore, his silverbeard gleaming in the dying sun
	next to him trotted cornelius fudge
	behind them came the feeble old committee member and the executioner,macnair
	yeh gotta go, said hagrid
	every inch of him was trembling
	theymustn' find yeh here
	ron stuffed scabbers into his pocket and hermione picked up the cloak
	i'll let yeh out the back way, said hagrid
	they followed him to the door into his back garden
	harry felt strangelyunreal, and even more so when he saw buckbeak a few yards away, tetheredto a tree behind hagrid's pumpkin patch
	buckbeak seemed to knowsomething was happening
	he turned his sharp head from side to side andpawed the ground nervously
	it's okay, beaky, said hagrid softly
	he turned toharry, ron, and hermione
	hagrid, we can't we'll tell them what really happened they can't kill him go said hagrid fiercely
	it's bad enough without you lot in troublean' allthey had no choice
	as hermione threw the cloak over harry and ron, theyheard voices at the front of the cabin
	hagrid looked at the place wherethey had just vanished from sight
	go quick, he said hoarsely
	and he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door
	slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, harry, ron, and hermione set offsilently around hagrid's house
	as they reached the other side, thefront door closed with a sharp snap
	please, let's hurry, hermione whispered
	i can't stand it, i can'tbear it
	they started up the sloping lawn toward the castle
	the sun was sinkingfast now the sky had turned to a clear, purpletinged grey, but to thewest there was a rubyred glow
	oh, please, ron, hermione began
	it's scabbers  he won't  stay put ron was bent over, trying to keep scabbers in his pocket, but the ratwas going berserk squeaking madly, twisting and flailing, trying tosink his teeth into ron's hand
	scabbers, it's me, you idiot, it's ron, ron hissed
	they heard a door open behind them and men's voices
	oh, ron, please let's move, they're going to do it hermione breathed
	okay  scabbers, stay put they walked forward harry, like hermione, was trying not to listen tothe rumble of voices behind them
	i can't hold him  scabbers, shut up, everyone'll hear us the rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up thesounds drifting from hagrid's garden
	there was a jumble of indistinctmale voices, a silence, and then, without warning, the unmistakableswish and thud of an axe
	hermione swayed on the spot
	they did it she whispered to harry
	i d  don't believe it  theydid itchapter seventeencat, rat, and dogharry's mind had gone blank with shock
	the three of them stoodtransfixed with horror under the invisibility cloak
	the very last raysof the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the long shadowedgrounds
	then, behind them, they heard a wild howling
	hagrid, harry muttered
	without thinking about what he was doing, hemade to turn back, but both ron and hermione seized his arms
	we can't, said ron, who was paperwhite
	he'll be in worse trouble ifthey know we've been to see him
	hermione's breathing was shallow and uneven
	how  could  they she choked
	how could theycome on, said ron, whose teeth seemed to be chattering
	they set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to keep themselveshidden under the cloak
	the light was fading fast now
	by the time they reached open ground, darkness was settling like a spellaround them
	scabbers, keep still, ron hissed, clamping his hand over his chest
	the rat was wriggling madly
	ron came to a sudden halt, trying to forcescabbers deeper into his pocket
	what's the matter with you, you stupidrat stay still  ouch he bit meron, be quiet hermione whispered urgently
	fudge'll be out here in aminute he won't  stay  put scabbers was plainly terrified
	he was writhing with all his might,trying to break free of ron's grip
	what's the matter with himbut harry had just seen  stinking toward them, his body low to theground, wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness  crookshanks
	whether he could see them or was following the sound of scabbers'ssqueaks, harry couldn't tell
	crookshanks hermione moaned
	no, go away, crookshanks go awaybut the cat was getting nearer scabbers  notoo late  the rat had slipped between ron's clutching fingers, hit theground, and scampered away
	in one bound, crookshanks sprang after him,and before harry or hermione could stop him, ron had thrown theinvisibility cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness
	she and harry looked at each other, then followed at a sprint it asimpossible to run full out under the cloak they pulled it off and itstreamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after ron they couldhear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at crookshanks
	get away from him  get away  scabbers, come here there was a loud thud
	gotcha get off, you stinking cat harry and hermione almost fell over ron they skidded to a stop right infront of him
	he was sprawled on the ground, but scabbers was back inhis pocket he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump
	ron  come on back under the cloak  hermione panted
	dumbledorethe minister  they'll be coming back out in a minute but before they could cover themselves again, before they could evencatch their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws
	something was bounding toward them, quiet as a shadow  an enormous,paleeyed, jetblack dog
	harry reached for his wand, but too late  the dog had made an enormousleap and the front paws hit him on the chest he keeled over backward ina whirl of hair he felt its hot breath, saw inch long teeth but the force of its leap had carried it too far it rolled off him
	dazed, feeling as though his ribs were broken, harry tried to stand uphe could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack
	as the dog sprang back toward them he pushed harryaside the dog's jaws fastened instead around ron's outstretched arm
	harry lunged forward, he seized a handful of the brute's hair, but itwas dragging ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll then, out of nowhere, something hit harry so hard across the face he wasknocked off his feet again
	he heard hermione shriek with pain and falltoo
	harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his eyeslumoshe whispered
	the wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree they had chasedscabbers into the shadow of the whomping willow and its branches werecreaking as though in a high wind, whipping backward and forward to stopthem going nearer
	and there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging ron backwardinto a large gap in the roots  ron was fighting furiously, but hishead and torso were slipping out of sight ron harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whippedlethally through the air and he was forced backward again
	all they could see now was one of ron's legs, which he had hooked arounda root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot ron's leg hadbroken, and a moment later, his foot vanished from sight
	harry  we've got to go for help  hermione gasped she was bleedingtoo the willow had cut her across the shoulder
	no that thing's big enough to eat him we haven't got time harry  we're never going to get through without help another branch whipped down at them, twigs clenched like knuckles
	if that dog can get in, we can, harry panted, darting here and there,trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but hecouldn't get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range ofthe tree's blows
	oh, help, help, hermione whispered frantically, dancing u
	certainlyon the spot, please
	crookshanks darted forward
	he slithered between the battering brancheslike a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk
	abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it stoppedmoving
	not a leaf twitched or shook
	crookshanks hermione whispered uncertainly
	she now grasped harry'sarm painfully hard
	how did he know he's friends with that dog, said harry grimly
	i've seen themtogether
	come on  and keep your wand out they covered the distance to the trunk in seconds, but before they hadreached the gap in the roots, crookshanks had slid into it with a flickof his bottlebrush tail
	harry went next he crawled forward, headfirst,and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel
	crookshanks was a little way along, his eyes flashing in the light fromharry's wand
	seconds later, hermione slithered down beside him
	where's ron she whispered in a terrified voice
	this way, said harry, setting off, bentbacked, after crookshanks
	where does this tunnel come out hermione asked breathlessly frombehind him
	it's marked on the marauder's map but fred and georgesaid no one's ever gotten into it
	it goes off the edge of the map,but it looked like it was heading for hogsmeade
	they moved as fast as they could, bent almost double ahead of them,crookshanks's tail bobbed in and out of view
	on and on went thepassage it felt at least as long as the one to honeydukes
	all harrycould think of was ron and what the enormous dog might be doing tohim
	he was drawing breath in sharp, painful gasps, running at acrouch
	and then the tunnel began to rise moments later it twisted, andcrookshanks had gone
	instead, harry could see a patch of dim lightthrough a small opening
	he and hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging forward
	both raisedtheir wands to see what lay beyond
	it was a room, a very disordered, dusty room
	paper was peeling from thewalls there were stains all over the floor every piece of furniturewas broken as though somebody had smashed it
	the windows were allboarded up
	harry glanced at hermione, who looked very frightened but nodded
	harry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around
	the room wasdeserted, but a door to their right stood open, leading to a shadowyhallway
	hermione suddenly grabbed harry's arm again
	her wide eyes weretraveling around the boarded windows
	harry, she whispered, i think we're in the shrieking shack
	his eyes fell on a wooden chair near them
	largechunks had been torn out of it one of the legs had been ripped offentirely
	ghosts didn't do that, he said slowly
	at that moment, there was a creak overhead
	something had movedupstairs
	both of them looked up at the ceiling
	hermione's grip onharry's arm was so tight he was losing feeling inhis fingers
	he raisedhis eyebrows at her she nodded again and let go
	quietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and up the crumblingstaircase
	everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except thefloor, where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something beingdragged upstairs
	they reached the dark landing
	nox, they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their wandswent out
	only one door was open
	as they crept toward it, they heardmovement from behind it a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring
	theyexchanged a last look, a last nod
	wand held tightly before him, harry kicked the door wide open
	on a magnificent fourposter bed with dusty hangings lay crookshanks,purring loudly at the sight of them
	on the floor beside him, clutchinghis leg, which stuck out at a strange angle, was ron
	harry and hermione dashed across to him
	ron  are you okaywhere's the dognot a dog, ron moaned
	his teeth were gritted with pain
	harry, it'sa trap what he's the dog
	ron was staring over harry's shoulder
	harry wheeled around
	with asnap, the man in the shadows closed the door behind them
	a mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows
	if eyes hadn't beenshining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a corpse
	thewaxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it lookedlike a skull
	his yellow teeth were bared in a grin
	expelliarmushe croaked, pointing ron's wand at them
	harry's and hermione's wands shot out of their hands, high in the air,and black caught them
	then he took a step closer
	his eyes were fixedon harry
	i thought you'd come and help your friend, he said hoarsely
	his voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of usingit
	your father would have done the same for me
	brave of you not torun for a teacher
	it will make everything mucheasier
	the taunt about his father rang in harry's ears as though black hadbellowed it
	a boiling hate erupted in harry's chest, leaving no placefor fear
	for the first time in his life, he wanted his wand back in hishand, not to defend himself, but to attack
	without knowingwhat he was doing, he started forward, but there was a sudden movementon either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held himback
	no, harry hermione gasped in a petrified whisper ron,however, spoke to black
	if you want to kill harry, you'll have to kill us too he saidfiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him ofstill more color, and he swayed slightly as he spoke
	something flickered in black's shadowed eyes
	lie down, he said quietly to ron
	you will damage that leg evenmore
	did you hear me ron said weakly, though he was clinging painfully toharry to stay upright
	you'll have to kill all three of usthere'll be only one murder here tonight, said brack, and his grinwidened
	why's that harry spat, trying to wrench himself free of ron, andhermione
	didn't care last time, did you didn't mind slaughtering allthose muggles to get at pettigrew
	what's the matter, gone soft inazkabanharry hermione whimpered
	be quiethe killed my mum and dad harry roared, and with a huge effort hebroke free of hermione's and ron's restraint and lunged forward he had forgotten about magic  he had forgotten that he was short andskinny and thirteen, whereas black was a tall, fullgrown man  allharry knew was that he wanted to hurt black as badly as he could andthat he didn't care how much he got hurt in return perhaps it was the shock of harry doing something so stupid, but blackdidn't raise the wands in time  one of harry's hands fastened over hiswasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away the knuckles of harry's otherhand collided with the side of black's head and they fell, backward,into the wall hermione was screaming ron was yelling there was a blinding flash asthe wands in black's hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missedharry's face by inches harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingerstwisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand punching every part ofblack it could find
	but black's free hand had found harry's throatno, he hissed, i've waited too long the fingers tightened, harry choked, his glasses askew
	then he saw hermione's foot swing out of nowhere
	black let go of harrywith a grunt of pain ron had thrown himself on black's wand hand andharry heard a faint clatter he fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rollingacross the floor he threw himself toward it butarghcrookshanks had joined the fray both sets of front claws had sunkthemselves deep into harry's arm harry threw him off, but crookshanksnow darted toward harry's wand no you don't roared harry, and he aimed a kick at crookshanks thatmade the cat leap aside, spitting harry snatched up his wand and turnedget out of the way he shouted at ron and hermione
	they didn't need telling twice
	hermione, gasping for breath, her lipbleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up her and ron's wands
	ron crawledto the fourposter and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face nowtinged with green, both hands clutching his broken leg
	black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall
	his thin chest rose andfell rapidly as he watched harry walking slowly nearer, his wandpointing straight at black's heart
	going to kill me, harry he whispered
	harry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing at black's chest,looking down at him
	a livid bruise was rising around black's left eyeand his nose was bleeding
	you killed my parents, said harry, his voice shaking slightly, but hiswand hand quite steady
	black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes
	i don't deny it, he said very quietly
	but if you knew the wholestory
	the whole story harry repeated, a furious pounding in his ears
	yousold them to voldemort
	that's all i need to know
	you've got to listen to me, black said, and there was a note ofurgency in his voice now
	you'll regret it if you don't
	i understand a lot better than you think, said harry, and his voiceshook more than ever
	you never heard her, did you my mum
	trying tostop voldemort killing me
	before either of them could say another word, something ginger streakedpast harry crookshanks leapt onto black's chest and settled himselfthere, right over black's heart
	black blinked and looked down at thecat
	get off, he murmured, trying to push crookshanks off him
	but crookshanks sank his claws into black's robes and wouldn't shift
	heturned his ugly, squashed face to harry and looked up at him with thosegreat yellow eyes
	to his right, hermione gave a dry sob
	harry stared down at black and crookshanks, his grip tightening on thewand
	so what if he had to kill the cat too it was in league withblack
	if it was prepared to die, trying to protect black, thatwasn't harry's business
	if black wanted to save it, that only provedhe cared more for crookshanks than for harry's parents
	harry raised the wand
	now was the moment to do it
	now was the momentto avenge his mother and father
	he was going to kill black
	the seconds lengthened
	and still harry stood frozen there, wand poised,black staring up at him, crookshanks on his chest
	ron's raggedbreathing came from near the bed hermione was quite silent
	and then came a new sound muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor  someone wasmoving downstairs
	we're up here hermione screamed suddenly
	we're up here  siriusblack  quickblack made a startled movement that almost dislodged crookshanks harrygripped his wand convulsively  do it now said a voice in his head but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and harry still hadn'tdone it
	the door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and harrywheeled around as professor lupin came hurtling into the room, his facebloodless, his wand raised and ready
	his eyes flickered over ron, lyingon the floor, over hermione, cowering next to the door, to harry,standing there with his wand covering black, and then to black himself,crumpled and bleeding at harry's feet
	expelliarmus lupin shouted
	harry's wand flew once more out of his hand so did the two hermione washolding
	lupin caught them all deftly, then moved into the room, staringat black, who still had crookshanks lying protectively across his chest
	harry stood there, feeling suddenly empty
	his nervehad failed him
	black was going to be handed back to the dementors
	then lupin spoke, in a very tense voice
	where is he, siriusharry looked quickly at lupin
	he didn't understannd what lupin meant
	who was lupin talking about he turned to look at black again
	black's face was quite expressionless
	for a few seconds, he didn't moveat all
	then, very slowly, he raised his empty hand and pointed straightat ron
	mystified, harry glanced around at ron, who looked bewildered
	lupin muttered, staring at black so intently it seemed hewas trying to read his mind,
	why hasn't he shown himself beforenow unless  lupin's eyes suddenly widened, as though he was seeingsomething beyond black, something none of the rest could see,  unlesshe was the one
	without telling mevery slowly, his sunken gaze never leaving lupin's face, black nodded
	professor, harry interrupted loudly, what's going on but he never finished the question, because what he saw made his voicedie in his throat
	lupin was lowering his wand, gazing fixed at black
	the professor walked to black's side, seized his hand, pulled him to hisfeet so that crookshanks fell to the floor, and embraced black like abrother
	harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach
	don't believe it hermione screamed
	lupin let go of black and turned to her
	she had raised herself off thefloor and was pointing at lupin, wildeyed
	you  you hermione  you and himhermione, calm down i didn't tell anyone hermione shrieked
	i've been covering up foryou hermione, listen to me, please' lupin shouted
	i can explain harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh waveof fury
	i trusted you, he shouted at lupin, his voice wavering, out ofcontrol, and all the time you've been his friendyou're wrong, said lupin
	i haven't been sirius's friend, but i amnow  let me explain
	harry, don't trust him, he's been helpingblack get into the castle, he wants you dead too  he's a werewolfthere was a ringing silence
	everyone's eyes were now on lupin, wholooked remarkably calm, though rather pale
	not at all up to your usual standard, hermione, he said
	only one outof three, i'm afraid
	i have not been helping sirius get into the castleand i certainly don't want harry dead
	an odd shiver passed over hisface
	but i won't deny that i am a werewolf
	ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimperof pain
	lupin made toward him, looking concerned, but ron gasped, getaway ftom me, werewolflupin stopped dead
	then, with an obvious effort, he turned to hermioneand said, how long have you knownages, hermione whispered
	since i did professor snape's essay
	he'll be delighted, said lupin coolly
	he assigned that essay hopingsomeone would realize what my symptoms meant
	did you check the lunarchart and realize that i was always ill at the full moon or did yourealize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw meboth, hermione said quietly
	you're the cleverest witch of your age i've ever met, hermione
	i'm not, hermione whispered
	if i'd been a bit cleverer, i'd havetold everyone what you arebut they already know, said lupin
	at least, the staff do
	dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf
	ishe madsome of the staff thought so, said lupin
	he had to work very hard toconvince certain teachers that i'm trustworthy and he was wrong harry yelled
	youve been helping him all the timehe was pointing at black, who suddenly crossed to the fourposter bedand sank onto it, his face hidden in one shaking hand
	crookshanks leaptup beside him and stepped onto his lap, purring
	ron edged away fromboth of them, dragging his leg
	i have not been helping sirius, said lupin
	if you'll give me achance, i'll explain
	look he separated harry's, ron's and hermione's wands and threw each back toits owner harry caught his, stunned
	there, said lupin, sticking his own wand back into his belt you'rearmed, we're not
	now will you listenharry didn't know what to think
	was it a trickif you haven't been helping him, he said, with a furious glance atblack, how did you know he was herethe map, said lupin
	i was in my office examiningit you know how to work it harry said suspiciously
	of course i know how to work it, said lupin, waving his handimpatiently
	i'm moony  that was my friends'nickname for me at school
	you wrote the important thing is, i was watching it carefully this evening,because i had an idea that you, ron, and hermione might try and sneakout of the castle to visit hagrid before his hippogriff was executed
	and i was right, wasn't ihe had started to pace up and down, looking at them
	little patches ofdust rose at his feet
	you might have been wearing your father's old cloak, harryhow d'you know about the cloakthe number of times i saw james disappearing under it
	, said lupin,waving an impatient hand again
	the point is, even if you're wearing aninvisibility cloak, you still show up on the marauder's map
	i watchedyou cross the grounds and enter hagrid's hut
	twenty minutes later, youleft hagrid, and set off back toward the castle
	but you were nowaccompanied by somebody else
	no, we weren'ti couldn't believe my eyes, said lupin, still pacing, and ignoringharry's interruption
	i thought the map must be malfunctioning
	howcould he be with you no one was with us said harry
	and then i saw another dot, moving fast toward you, labeled siriusblack
	i saw him collide with you i watched as he pulled two of youinto the whomping willow one of us ron said angrily
	he had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over ron
	do you think i could have a look at the rat he said evenly
	what's scabbers got to do with iteverything, said lupin
	could i see him, pleaseron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes
	scabbers emerged,thrashing desperately ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop himescaping
	crookshanks stood up on black's leg and made a soft hissingnoise
	lupin moved closer to ron
	he seemed to be holding his breath as hegazed intently at scabbers
	what ron said again, holding scabbers close to him, looking scared
	what's my rat got to do with anythingthat's not a rat, croaked sirius black suddenly
	what d'you mean  of course he's a rat no, he's not, said lupin quietly
	an animagus, said black, by the name of peter pettigrew
	chapter eighteenmoony, wormtail, paddfoot, and prongsit took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in
	then ron voiced what harry was thinking
	ridiculous said hermione faintly
	peter pettigrew's dead said harry
	he killed him twelve years agohe pointed at black, whose face twitched convulsively
	i meant to, he growled, his yellow teeth bared, but little peter gotthe better of me
	not this time, thoughand crookshanks was thrown to the floor as black lunged at scabbers ronyelled with pain as black's weight fell on his broken leg
	sirius, no lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and draggingblack away from ron again, wait you can't do it just like that  theyneed to understand  we've got to explain we can explain afterwards snarled black, trying to throw lupin off
	one hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach scabbers, whowas squealing like a piglet, scratching ron's face and neck as he triedto escape
	they've  got  a  right  to  know  everything lupinpanted, still trying to restrain black
	ron's kept him as a pet thereare parts of it even i don't understand, and harry  you owe harry thetruth, siriusblack stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed onscabbers, who was clamped tightly under ron's bitten, scratched, adbleeding hands
	all right, then, black said, without taking his eyes off the rat
	tell them whatever you like
	but make it quick, remus
	i want to committhe murder i was imprisoned for
	you're nutters, both of you, said ron shakily, looking round at harryand hermione for support
	i've had enough of this
	he tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but lupin raised his wandagain, pointing it at scabbers
	you're going to hear me out, ron, he said quietly
	just keep a tighthold on peter while you listen
	he's not peter, he's scabbers ron yelled, trying to fore the rat backinto his front pocket, but scabbers was fighting to hard ron swayed andoverbalanced, and harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed
	then, ignoring black, harry turned to lupin
	there were witnesses who saw pettigrew die, he said
	a whole streetfull of them
	they didn't see what they thought they saw said black savagely, stillwatching scabbers struggling in ron's hands
	everyone thought sirius killed peter, said lupin, nodding
	i believedit myself  until i saw the map tonight
	because the marauder's mapnever lies
	ron's holding him, harry
	harry looked down at ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silentlyblack and lupin were both out of their minds
	their story made no sensewhatsoever
	how could scabbers be peter pettigrew azkaban must haveunhinged black after all  but why was lupin playing along with himthen hermione spoke, in a trembling, wouldbe calm sort of voice, asthough trying to will professor lupin to talk sensibly
	scabbers can't be pettigrew
	it just can't betrue, you know it can't
	why can't it be true lupin said calmly, as though they were in class,and hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment withgrindylows
	because people would know if peter pettigrew had been ananimagus
	we did animagi in class with professor mcgonagall
	and ilooked them up when i did my homework  the ministry of magic keepstabs on witches and wizards who can become animals there's a registershowing what animal they become, and their markings and things
	and iwent and looked professor mcgonagall up on the register, and there havebeen only seven animagi this century, and pettigrew's name wasn't on thelist
	harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort hermione putinto her homework, when lupin started to laugh
	light again, hermione he said
	but the ministry never knew that hereused to be three unregistered animagi running around hogwarts
	i you're going to tell them the story, get a move on, remus, saidblack, who was still watching scabbers's every desperate move
	i'vewaited twelve years, i'm not going to wait much longer
	but you'll need to help me, sirius, said lupin, i onlyknow how it began
	there had been a loud creak behind him
	the bedroomdoor had opened of its own accord
	all five of them stared at it
	thenlupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing
	this place is haunted said ron
	it's not, said lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way
	theshrieking shack was never haunted
	the screams and howls thevillagers used to hear were made by me
	he pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment thensaid, that's where all of this starts  with my becoming a werewolf,none of this could have happened if i hadn't been bitter
	and if ihadn't been so foolhardy
	he looked sober and tired
	ron started to interrupt, but hermione, said,shh she was watching lupin very intently
	i as a very small boy when i received the bite
	my parents triedeverything, but in those days there was no cure
	the potion thatprofessor snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery
	itmakes me safe, you see
	as long as i take it in the week, preceding thefull moon, i keep my mind when i transform
	i'm able to curl up in myoffice, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again
	before the wolfsbane potion was discovered, however, i became a fullyfledged monster once a month
	it seemed impossible that i would be ableto come to hogwarts
	other parents weren't likely to want their childrenexposed to me
	but then dumbledore became headmaster, and he was sympathetic
	he saidthat as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason ishouldn't come to school
	lupin sighed, and looked directly atharry
	i told you, months ago, that the whomping willow was planted theyear i came to hogwarts
	the truth is that it was planted because i cameto hogwarts
	this house  lupin looked miserably around the room, the tunnel that leads to it  they were built for my use
	once amonth, i was smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to transform
	the tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across mewhile i was dangerous
	harry couldn't see where this story was going, but he was listeningraptly all the same
	the only sound apart from lupin's voice wasscabbers's frightened squeaking
	my transformations in those days were  were terrible
	it is verypainful to turn into a werewolf
	i was separated from humans to bite, soi bit and scratched myself instead
	the villagers heard the noise andthe screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violentspirits
	dumbledore encouraged the rumor
	even now, when the househas been silent for years, the villagers don't dare approach it
	but apart from my transformations, i was happier than i had ever beenin my life
	for the first time ever, i had friends, three great friends
	and, of course, your father, harry james potter
	now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that i disappearedonce a month
	i made up all sorts of stories
	i told them my mother wasill, and that i had to go home to see her
	i was terrified they woulddesert me the moment they found out what i was
	but of course, they,like you, hermione, worked out the truth
	and they didn't desert me at all
	instead, they did something for methat would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best timesof my life
	my dad too said harry, astounded
	yes, indeed, said lupin
	it took them the best part of three years towork out how to do it
	your father and sirius here were the clevereststudents in the school, and lucky they were, because the animagustransformation can go horribly wrong  one reason the ministry keeps aclose watch on those attempting to do it
	peter needed all the help hecould get from james and sirius
	finally, in our fifth year, theymanaged it
	they could each turn into a different animal at will
	but how did that help you said hermione, sounding puzzled
	they couldn't keep me company as humans, so they kept me company asanimals, said lupin
	a werewolf is only a danger to people
	theysneaked out of the castle every month under james's invisibility cloak
	peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath thewillow's attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it
	theywould then slip down the tunnel and join me
	under their influence, ibecame less dangerous
	my body was still wolfish, but my mind seemed tobecome less so while i was with them
	hurry up, remus, snarled black, who was still watching scabbers with ahorrible sort of hunger on his face
	i'm getting there, sirius, i'm getting there
	well, highly excitingpossibilities were open to us now that we could all transform
	soon wewere leaving the shrieking shack and roaming the school grounds and thevillage by night
	sirius and james transformed into such large animals,they were able to keep a werewolf in check
	i doubt whether any hogwartsstudents ever found out more about the hogwarts grounds and hogsmeadethan we did
	and that's how we came to write the marauder's map, andsign it with our nicknames
	what sort of animal  harry began, but hermione cut him off
	that was still really dangerous running around in the dark with awerewolf what if you'd given the others the slip, and bitten somebodya thought that still haunts me, said lupin heavily
	and there werenear misses, many of them
	we laughed about them afterwards
	we wereyoung, thoughtless  carried away with our own cleverness
	i sometimes felt guilty about betraying dumbledore's trust, of course
	he had admitted me to hogwarts when no other headmaster would have doneso, and he had no idea i was breaking the rules he had set down for myown and others' safety
	he never knew i had led three fellow studentsinto becoming animagi illegally
	but i always managed to forget myguilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month'sadventure
	and i haven't changed
	lupin's face had hardened, and there was selfdisgust in his voice
	allthis year, i have been battling with myself, wondering whether i shouldtell dumbledore that sirius was an animagus
	whybecause i was too cowardly
	it would have meant admitting that i'dbetrayed his trust while i was at school, admitting that i'd led othersalong with me
	and dumbledore's trust has meant everything to me
	helet me into hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when i have beenshunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what iam
	and so i convinced myself that sirius was getting into the schoolusing dark arts he learned from voldemort, that being an animagus hadnothing to do with it
	so, in a way, snape's been right about me allalong
	snape said black harshly, taking his eyes off scabbers for the firsttime in minutes and looking up at lupin
	what's snape got to do withithe's here, sirius, said lupin heavily
	he's teaching here as well
	he looked up at harry, ron, and hermione
	professor snape was at school with us
	he fought very hard against myappointment to the defense against the dark arts job
	he has beentelling dumbledore a year that i am not to be trusted
	you see, sirius here played a trick on him which nearlykilled him, a trick which involved me black made a derisive noise
	it served him right, he sneered
	sneaking around, trying to find outwhat we were up to
	hoping he could get us expelled
	severus was very interested in where i went every month
	lupin toldharry, ron, and hermione
	we were in the same year, you know, and we er  didn't like each other very much
	he especially disliked james
	jealous, i think, of james's talent on the quidditch field
	anywaysnape had seen me crossing the grounds with madam pomfrey one evening asshe led me toward the whomping willow to transform
	sirius thought itwould be  er  amusing, to tell snape all he had to do was prod theknot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he'd be able to get inafter me
	well, of course, snape tried it  if he'd got as far as thishouse, he'd have met a fully grown werewolf  but your father, who'dheard what sirius had done, went after snape and pulled him back, atgreat risk to his life
	snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of thetunnel
	he was forbidden by dumbledore to tell anybody, but from thattime on he knew what i was
	so that's why snape doesn't like you, said harry slowly, because hethought you were in on the jokethat's right, sneered a cold voice from the wall behind lupin
	severus snape was pulling off the invisibility cloak, his wand pointing,directly at lupin
	chapter nineteenthe servant of lord voldemorthermione screamed
	black leapt to his feet
	harry felt as though he'dreceived a huge electric shock
	i found this at the base of the whomping willow, said snape, throwingthe cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at lupin'schest
	very useful, potter, i thank you
	snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressedtriumph
	you're wondering, perhaps, how i knew you were here he said,his eyes glittering
	i've just been to your office, lupin
	you forgotto take your potion tonight, so i took a gobletful along
	lucky for me, i mean
	lying on your desk was a certain map
	oneglance at it told me all i needed to know
	i saw you running along thispassageway and out of sight
	severus  lupin began, but snape overrode him
	i've told the headmaster again and again that you're helping your oldfriend black into the castle, lupin, and here's the proof
	not even idreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideoutseverus, you're making a mistake, said lupin urgently
	you haven'theard everything  i can explain  sirius is not here to kill harrytwo more for azkaban tonight, said snape, his eyes now gleamingfanatically
	i shall be interested to see how dumbledore takes this
	he was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, lupin
	a tamewerewolf you fool, said lupin softly
	is a schoolboy grudge worth putting aninnocent man back inside azkabanbang thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of snape's wand andtwisted themselves around lupin's mouth, wrists, and ankles heoverbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move
	with a roar of rage,black started toward snape, but snape pointed his wand straight betweenblack's eyes
	give me a reason, he whispered
	give me a reason to do it, and iswear i will
	it would have been impossible to say which faceshowed more hatred
	harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom to believe
	he glanced around at ron and hermione
	ron looked just as confused as hedid, still fighting to keep hold on the struggling scabbers
	hermione,however, took an uncertain step toward snape and said, in a verybreathless voice, professor snape  it it wouldn't hurt to hear whatthey've got to say, w  would itmiss granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,snape spat
	you, potter, and weasley are outofbounds, in the companyof a convicted murderer and a werewolf
	for once in your life, hold yourtongue
	but if  if there was a mistake keep quiet, you stupid girl snape shouted, looking suddenly quitederanged
	don't talk about what you don't understand a few sparksshot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointed at black'sface
	hermione fell silent
	vengeance is very sweet, snape breathed at black
	how i hoped i wouldbe the one to catch you
	the joke's on you again, severus, black snarled
	as long as this boybrings his rat up to the castle  he jerked his head at ron  i'llcome quietly
	up to the castle said snape silkily
	i don't think we need to gothat far
	all i have to do is call the dementors once we get out of thewillow
	they'll be very pleased to see you, black
	pleased enough togive you a little kiss, i daresay
	i what little color there was in blacks face left it
	you you've got to hear me out, he croaked
	the rat  look at therat but there was a mad glint in snape's eyes that harry had never seenbefore
	he seemed beyond reason
	come on, all of you, he said
	he clicked his fingers, and the ends ofthe cords that bound lupin flew to his hands
	i'll drag the werewolf
	perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too before he knew what he was doing, harry had crossed the room in threestrides and blocked the door
	get out of the way, potter, you're in enough trouble already, snarledsnape
	if i hadn't been here to save your skin professor lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,harry said
	i've been alone with him loads of times, having defenselessons against the dementors
	if he was helping black, why didn't hejust finish me off thendon't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf's mind works, hissed snape
	get out of the way, potter
	youre pathetic harry yelled
	just because they made a fool of you atschool you won't even listen silence i will not be spoken to like that snape shrieked, lookingmadder than ever
	like father, like son, potter i have just saved yourneck you should be thanking me on bended knee you would have been wellserved if he'd killed you you'd have died like your father, tooarrogant to believe you might be mistaken in black  now get out of theway, or i will make you
	get out of the way, potterharry made up his mind in a split second
	before snape could take evenone step toward him, he had raised his wand
	expelliarmus he yelled  except that his wasn't the only voice thatshouted
	there was a blast that made the door rattle on its hingessnape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid downit to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair
	he hadbeen knocked out
	both ron and hermione had tried to disarm snape atexactly the same moment
	snape's wand soared in a high arc and landed onthe bed next to crookshanks
	you shouldn't have done that, said black, looking at harry
	you should have left him to me
	harry avoided black's eyes
	he wasn't sure, even now, that he'd done theright thing
	we attacked a teacher
	we attacked a teacher
	hermione whimpered,staring at the lifeless snape with frightened eyes
	oh, we're going tobe in so much trouble lupin was struggling against his bonds
	black bent down quickly anduntied him
	lupin straightened up, rubbing his arms where the ropes hadcut into them
	thank you, harry, he said
	i'm still not saying i believe you, he told lupin
	then it's time we offered you some proof, said lupin
	you, boy give me peter, please
	ron clutched scabbers closer to his chest
	come off it, he said weakly
	are you trying to say he broke out ofazkaban just to get his hands on scabbers i mean
	he looked up atharry and hermione for support, okay, say pettigrew could turn into arat  there are millions of rats  how's he supposed to know which onehe's after if he was locked up in azkabanyou know, sirius, that's a fair question, said lupin, turning to blackand frowning slightly
	how did you find out where he wasblack put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out acrumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat and held out to show theothers
	it was the photograph of ron and his family that had appeared in thedaily prophet the previous summer, and there, on ron's shoulder, wasscabbers
	how did you get this lupin asked black, thunderstruck
	when he came to inspect azkaban last year, he gaveme his paper
	and there was peter, on the front page on this boy'sshoulder
	how many times had i seen himtransform and the caption said the boy would be going back tohogwarts
	my god, said lupin softly, staring from scabbers to the picture in thepaper and back again
	what about it said ron defiantly
	he's got a toe missing, said black
	of course, lupin breathed
	he cut it offhimselfjust before he transformed, said black
	when i cornered him, heyelled for the whole street to hear that i'd betrayed lily and james
	then, before i could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wandbehind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself  andsped down into the sewer with the other rats
	didn't you ever hear, ron said lupin
	the biggest bit of peter theyfound was his finger
	look, scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something he'sbeen in my family for ages, right twelve years, in fact, said lupin
	didn't you ever wonder why he wasliving so longwe  we've been taking good care of him said ron
	not looking too good at the moment, though, is he said lupin
	i'dguess he's been losing weight ever since he heard sirius was on theloose again
	he's been scared of that mad cat said ron, nodding towardcrookshanks, who was still purring on the bed
	but that wasn't right, harry thought suddenly
	scabbers had beenlooking ill before he met crookshanks
	ever since ron's return fromegypt
	since the time when black had escaped
	this cat isn't mad, said black hoarsely
	he reached out a bony handand stroked crookshanks's fluffy head
	he's the most intelligent of hiskind i've ever met
	he recognized peter for what he was right away
	andwhen he met me, he knew i was no dog
	it was a while before he trustedme
	finally, i managed to communicate to him what i was after, andhe's been helping me
	what do you mean breathed hermione
	he tried to bring peter to me, but couldn't
	so he stole thepasswords into gryffindor tower for me
	as i understand it, he tookthem from a boy's bedside table
	harry's brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he washearing
	but peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it
	this cat  crookshanks, did you call him  told me peter had leftblood on the sheets
	i supposed he bit himself
	well, faking hisown death had worked once
	these words jolted harry to his senses
	and why did he fake his death he said furiously
	because he knew youwere about to kill him like you killed my parentsno, said lupin, harryand now you've come to finish him offyes, i have, said black, with an evil look at scabbers
	then i should've let snape take you harry shouted
	harry, said lupin hurriedly, don't you see all this time we'vethought sirius betrayed your parents, and peter tracked him down  butit was the other way around, don't you see peter betrayed your motherand father  sirius tracked peter down that's not true harry yelled
	he was their secretkeeper he said sobefore you turned up
	he said he killed themhe was pointing at black, who shook his head slowly the sunken eyeswere suddenly over bright
	i as good as killed them, he croaked
	i persuaded lily andjames to change to peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use himas secretkeeper instead of me
	i'm to blame, i know it
	the nightthey died, i'd arranged to check on peter, make sure he was still safe,but when i arrived at his hiding place, he'd gone
	yet there was no signof a struggle
	it didn't feel right
	i set out for yourparents' house straight away
	and when i saw their house, destroyed, andtheir bodies
	i realized what peter must've done
	enough of this, said lupin, and there was a steely note in his voiceharry had never heard before
	there's one certain way to prove whatreally happened
	ron, give me that rat
	what are you going to do with him if i give him to you ron askedlupin tensely
	force him to show himself, said lupin
	if he really is a rat, itwon't hurt him
	then at long last, he held out scabbers and lupin tookhim
	scabbers began to squeak without stopping, twisting and turning,his tiny black eyes bulging in his head
	ready, sirius said lupin
	black had already retrieved snape's wand from the bed
	he approachedlupin and the struggling rat, and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to beburning in his face
	together he said quietly
	i think so,,, said lupin, holding scabbers tightly in one hand and hiswand in the other
	on the count of three
	one  two  threea flash of bluewhite light erupted from both wands for a moment,scabbers was frozen in midair, his small gray form twisting madly  ronyelled  the rat fell and hit the floor
	there was another blindingflash of light and then it was like watching a speededup film of a growing tree
	a head wasshooting upward from the ground limbs were sprouting a moment later, aman was standing where scabbers had been, cringing and wringing hishands
	crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed the hair on hisback was standing up
	he was a very short man, hardly taller than harry and hermione
	histhin, colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch ontop
	he had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot ofweight in a short time
	his skin looked grubby, almost like scabbers'sfur, and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and hisvery small, watery eyes
	he looked around at them all, his breathingfast and shallow
	harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again
	well, hello, peter, said lupin pleasantly, as though rats frequentlyerupted into old school friends around him
	even pettigrew's voice was squeaky
	again, his eyes darted toward the door
	black's wand arm rose, but lupin seized him around the wrist, gave him awarning took, then turned again to pettigrew, his voice light andcasual
	we've been having a little chat, peter, about what happened the nightlily and james died
	you might have missed the finer points while youwere squeaking around down there on the bed remus, gasped pettigrew, and harry could see beads of sweat breakingout over his pasty face, you don't believe him, do you
	he tried tokill me, remus
	so we've heard, said lupin, more coldly
	i'd like to clear up one ortwo little matters with you, peter, if you'll be so he's come to try and kill me again pettigrew squeaked suddenly,pointing at black, and harry saw that he used his middle finger, becausehis index was missing
	he killed lily and james and now he's going tokill me too
	you've got to help me, remus
	black's face looked more skulllike than ever as he stared at pettigrewwith his fathomless eyes
	no one's going to try and kill you until we've sorted a few thingsout, said lupin
	sorted things out squealed pettigrew, looking wildly about him oncemore, eyes taking in the boarded windows and, again' the only door
	iknew he'd come after me i knew he'd be back for me i've been waitingfor this for twelve yearsyou knew sirius was going to break out of azkaban said lupin, hisbrow furrowed
	when nobody has ever done it beforehe's got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of pettigrewshouted shrilly
	how else did he get out of there i supposehewhomustnotbenamed taught him a few tricksblack started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh that filled thewhole room
	voldemort, teach me tricks he said
	pettigrew flinched as though black had brandished a whip at him
	what, scared to hear your old master's name said black
	i don't blameyou, peter
	his lot aren't very happy with you, are theydon't know what you mean, sirius  muttered pettigrew, his breathingfaster than ever
	his whole face was shining with sweat now
	you haven't been hiding from me for twelve years, said black
	you'vebeen hiding from voldemort's old supporters
	i heard things in azkaban,peter
	they all think you're dead, or you'd have to answer to them
	i've heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep
	soundslike they think the doublecrosser doublecrossed them
	voldemort wentto the potters' on your information
	and voldemort met his downfallthere
	and not all voldemort's supporters ended up in azkaban, did theythere are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they'veseen the error of their ways
	if they ever got wind that you were still alive, peter don't know
	what you're talking about
	, said pettigrew again, moreshrilly than ever
	he wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up atlupin
	you don't believe this  this madness, remus i must admit, peter, i have difficulty in understanding why an innocentman would want to spend twelve years as a rat, said lupin evenly
	innocent, but scared squealed pettigrew
	if voldemort's supporterswere after me, it was because i put one of their best men in azkaban the spy, sirius blackblack's face contorted
	how dare you, he growled, sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog hehad been
	i, a spy for voldemort when did i ever sneak around peoplewho were stronger and more powerful than myself but you, peter  i'llnever understand why i didn't see you were the spy from the start
	youalways liked big friends who'd look after you, didn't you it used to beus
	pettigrew wiped his face again he was almost panting for breath
	must be out of your mind
	don't know how youcan say such a lily and james only made you secretkeeper because i suggested it,black hissed, so venomously that pettigrew took a step backward
	ithought it was the perfect plan
	voldemort would be sure tocome after me, would never dream they'd use a weak, talentless thinglike you
	it must have been the finest moment of your miserable life,telling voldemort you could hand him the potters
	pettigrew was muttering distractedly harry caught words likefarfetched and lunacy, but he couldn't help paying more attentionto the ashen color of pettigrew's face and the way his eyes continued todart toward the windows and door
	professor lupin said hermione timidly
	can  can i say somethingcertainly, hermione, said lupin courteously
	well  scabbers  i mean, this  this man  he's been sleeping inharry's dormitory for three years
	if he's working for youknowwho, howcome he never tried to hurt harry before nowthere said pettigrew shrilly, pointing at ron with his maimed hand
	thank you you see, remus i have never hurt a hair of harry's headwhy should ii'll tell you why, said black
	because you never did anything foranyone unless you could see what was in it for you
	voldemort's been inhiding for fifteen years, they say he's half dead
	you weren't about tocommit murder right under albus dumbledore's nose, for a wreck of awizard who'd lost all of his power, were you you'd want to be quitesure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back tohim, wouldn't you why else did you find a wizard family to take you inkeeping an ear out for news, weren't you, peter just in case your oldprotector regained strength, and it was safe to rejoin him
	pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times
	he seemed tohave lost the ability to talk
	black  sirius said hermione
	black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at hermione asthough he had never seen anything quite like her
	if you don't mind me asking, how  how did you get out of azkaban, ifyou didn't use dark magicthank you gasped pettigrew, nodding frantically at her
	exactlyprecisely what i but lupin silenced him with a look
	black was frowning slightly athermione, but not as though he were annoyed with her
	he seemed to bepondering his answer
	i don't know how i did it, he said slowly
	i think the only reason inever lost my mind is that i knew i was innocent
	that wasn't a happythought, so the dementors couldn't suck it out of me
	but it kept mesane and knowing who i am
	helped me keep my powers
	so when it allbecame
	i could transform in my cell
	dementors can't see, you know
	they feel their waytoward people by feeding off their emotions
	they could tell that myfeelings were less  less human, less complex when i was a dog
	butthey thought, of course, that i was losing my mind like everyone else inthere, so it didn't trouble them
	but i was weak, very weak, and i hadno hope of driving them away from me without a wand
	but then i saw peter in that picture
	i realized he was at hogwartswith harry
	perfectly positioned to act, if one hint reached his earsthat the dark side was gathering strength again
	pettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing noiselessly, but staring allthe while at black as though hypnotized
	ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies
	and todeliver the last potter to them
	if he gave them harry, who'd dare sayhe'd betrayed lord voldemort he'd be welcomed back with honors
	so you see, i had to do something
	i was the only one who knew peterwas still alive
	harry remembered what mr
	weasley had told mrs
	the guards sayhe's been talking in his sleep
	always the same words
	'it was as if someone had lit a fire in my head, and the dementorscouldn't destroy it
	it wasn't a happy feeling
	but it gave me strength, it cleared my mind
	so, one nightwhen they opened my door to bring food, i slipped past them as a dog
	it's so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they wereconfused
	i was thin, very thin
	thin enough to slip through thebars
	i swam as a dog back to the mainland
	i journeyed north andslipped into the hogwarts grounds as a dog
	i've been living in theforest ever since, except when i came to watch the quidditch, of course
	you fly as well as your father did, harry
	he looked at harry, who did not look away
	believe me, croaked black
	i never betrayed jamesand lily
	i would have died before i betrayed them
	and at long last, harry believed him
	throat too tight to speak, henodded
	nopettigrew had fallen to his knees as though harry's nod had been his owndeath sentence
	he shuffled forward on his knees, groveling, his handsclasped in front of him as though praying
	you wouldn't black kicked out and pettigrew recoiled
	there's enough filth on my robes without you touching them, saidblack
	remus pettigrew squeaked, turning to lupin instead, writhingimploringly in front of him
	you don't believe this wouldn't siriushave told you they'd changed the plannot if he thought i was the spy, peter, said lupin
	i assume that'swhy you didn't tell me, sirius he said casually over pettigrews head
	forgive me, remus, said black
	not at all, padfoot, old friend, said lupin, who was now rolling uphis sleeves
	and will you, in turn, forgive me for believing you werethe spyof course, said black, and the ghost of a grin flitted across hisgaunt face
	he, too, began rolling up his sleeves
	shall we kill himtogetheryes, i think so, said lupin grimly
	and he scrambledaround to ron
	haven't i been a good friend
	a good pet you won't let themkill me, ron, will you
	you're on my side, aren't you
	but ron was staring at pettigrew with the utmost revulsion
	i let you sleep in my bed he said
	pettigrew crawled toward ron you won't letthem do it
	if you made a better rat than a human, it's not much to boast about,peter, said black harshly
	ron, going still paler with pain, wrenchedhis broken leg out of pettigrew's reach
	pettigrew turned on his knees,staggered forward, and seized the hem of hermione's robes
	you  you won't let them
	hermione pulled her robes out of pettigrew's clutching hands and backedaway against the wall, looking horrified
	pettigrew knelt, trembling uncontrollably, andturned his head slowlytoward harry
	you look just like your father
	how dare you speak to harry roared black
	how dare you face him howdare you talk about james in front of himharry, whispered pettigrew, shuffling toward him, hands outstretched
	harry, james wouldn't have wanted me killed
	james would haveunderstood, harry
	he would have shown me mercy
	both black and lupin strode forward, seized pettigrew's shoulders, andthrew him backward onto the floor
	he sat there, twitching with terror,staring up at them
	you sold lily and james to voldemort, said black, who was shaking too
	do you deny itpettigrew burst into tears
	it was horrible to watch, like an oversized,balding baby, cowering on the floor
	sirius, sirius, what could i have done the dark lord
	he has weapons you can't imagine
	i was scared, sirius, i wasnever brave like you and remus and james
	i never meant it to happen
	hewhomustnotbenamed forced me don't lie bellowed black
	you'd been passing information to him fora year before lily and james died you were his spyhe  he was taking over everywhere gasped pettigrew
	wh  what wasthere to be gained by refusing himwhat was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who hasever existed said black, with a terrible fury in his face
	onlyinnocent lives, peteryou don't understand whined pettigrew
	he would have killed me,siriusthen you should have died roared black
	died rather than betray yourfriends, as we would have done for youblack and lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands raised
	you should have realized, said lupin quietly, if voldemort didn'tkill you, we would
	hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall
	he ran forward, placing himself in front pettigrew,facing the wands
	you can't kill him, he said breathlessly
	black and lupin both looked staggered
	harry, this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents, blacksnarled
	this cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too,without turning a hair
	his own stinking skin meant moreto him than your whole family
	we'll take him up to the castle
	we'll hand himover to the dementors
	he can go to azkaban
	harry gasped pettigrew, and he flung his arms around harry's knees
	you  thank you  it's more than i deserve  thank you get off me, harry spat, throwing pettigrew's hands off him in disgust
	i'm not doing this for you
	i'm doing it because  i don't reckon mydad would've wanted them to become killers  just for you
	no one moved or made a sound except pettigrew, whose breath was comingin wheezes as he clutched his chest
	black and lupin were looking ateach other
	then, with one movement, they lowered their wands
	you're the only person who has the right to decide, harry, said black
	he can go to azkaban, harry repeated
	if anyone deserves that place,he does
	pettigrew was still wheezing behind him
	very well, said lupin
	i'm going to tie him up, said lupin
	harry stepped out of the way
	thin cords shot from lupin's wand thistime, and next moment, pettigrew was wriggling on the floor, bound andgagged
	but if you transform, peter, growled black, his own wand pointing atpettigrew too, we will kill you
	you agree, harryharry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so thatpettigrew could see him
	right, said lupin, suddenly businesslike
	ron, i can't mend bonesnearly as well as madam pomfrey, so i think it's best if we just strapyour leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing
	he hurried over to ron, bent down, tapped ron's leg with his wand, andmuttered, ferula
	bandages spun up ron's leg, strapping it tightly toa splint
	lupin helped him to his feet ron put his weight gingerly onthe leg and didn't wince
	that's better, he said
	what about professor snape said hermione in a small voice, lookingdown at snape's prone figure
	there's nothing seriously wrong with him, said lupin, bending oversnape and checking his pulse
	you were just a little overenthusiastic
	er  perhaps it will be best if wedon't revive him until we're safety back in the castle
	we can take himlike this
	he muttered, mobilicorpus
	as though invisible strings were tied tosnape's wrists, neck, and knees, he was pulled into a standing position,head still lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet
	he hung a fewinches above the ground, his limp feet dangling
	lupin picked up theinvisibility cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket
	and two of us should be chained to this, said black, nudging pettigrewwith his toe
	i'll do it, said lupin
	and me, said ron savagely, limping forward
	black conjured heavy manacles from thin air soon pettigrew was uprightagain, left arm chained to lupin's right, right arm to ron's left
	he seemed to have taken scabbers's true identity as apersonal insult
	crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the wayout of the room, his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high
	chapter twentythe dementor's kissharry had never been part of a stranger group
	crookshanks led the waydown the stairs lupin, pettigrew, and ron went next, looking likeentrants in a sixlegged race
	next came professor snape, driftingcreepily along, his toes hitting each stair as they descended, held upby his own wand, which was being pointed at him by sirius
	harry andhermione brought up the rear
	getting back into the tunnel was difficult
	lupin, pettigrew, and ronhad to turn sideways to manage it lupin still had pettigrew coveredwith his wand
	harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel insingle file
	crookshanks was still in the lead
	harry went right afterblack, who was still making snape drift along ahead of them he keptbumping his lolling head on the low ceiling
	harry had the impressionblack was making no effort to prevent this
	you know what this means black said abruptly to harry as they madetheir slow progress along the tunnel
	turning pettigrew inyou' re free, said harry
	but i'm also  i don't know if anyone ever toldyou  i'm your godfather
	yeah, i knew that, said harry
	your parents appointed me your guardian, said black stiffly
	if anything happened to them
	did black mean what he thought he meanti'll understand, of course, if you want to stay with your aunt anduncle, said black
	once my name'scleared
	some sort of explosion took place in the pit of harry's stomach
	what  live with you he said, accidentally cracking his head on abit of rock protruding from the ceiling
	leave the dursleysof course, i thought you wouldn't want to, said black quickly
	iunderstand, i just thought i'd are you insane said harry, his voice easily as croaky as black's
	of course i want to leave the dursleys have you got a house when cani move inblack turned right around to look at him snape's head was scraping theceiling but black didn't seem to care
	you mean ityeah, i mean it said harry
	black's gaunt face broke into the first true smile harry had seen uponit
	the difference it made was startling, as though a person ten yearsyounger were shining through the starved mask for a moment, he wasrecognizable as the man who had laughed at harry's parents' wedding
	they did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel
	crookshanks darted up first he had evidently pressed his paw to theknot on the trunk, because lupin, pettigrew, and ron clambered upwardwithout any sound of savaging branches
	black saw snape up through the hole, then stood back for harry andhermione to pass
	at last, all of them were out
	the grounds were very dark now the only light came from the distantwindows of the castle
	without a word, they set off
	pettigrew was stillwheezing and occasionally whimpering
	harry's mind was buzzing
	he wasgoing to leave the dursleys
	he was going to live with sirius black, hisparents' best friend
	what would happen when hetold the dursleys he was going to live with the convict they'd seen ontelevision
	one wrong move, peter, said lupin threateningly ahead
	his wand wasstill pointed sideways at pettigrew's chest
	silently they tramped through the grounds, the castle lights growingslowly larger
	snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of black, his chinbumping on his chest
	and then a cloud shifted
	there were suddenly dim shadows on the ground
	theirparty was bathed in moonlight
	snape collided with lupin, pettigrew, and ron, who had stopped abruptly
	he flung out one arm to make harry and hermione stop
	harry could see lupin's silhouette
	then his limbsbegan to shake
	oh, my  hermione gasped
	he didn't take his potion tonight he'snot saferun, black whispered
	but harry couldn't run
	ron was chained to pettigrew and lupin
	he leaptforward but black caught him around the chest and threw him back
	leave it to me  runthere was a terrible snarling noise
	lupin's head was lengthening
	his shoulders were hunching
	hair was sprouting visibly onhis face and hands, which were curling into clawed paws
	crookshanks'shair was on end again he was backing away as the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, sirius disappeared fromharry's side
	the enormous, bearlike dog boundedforward
	as the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it,the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward, away from ronand pettigrew
	they were locked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping at each other
	harry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon the battle tonotice anything else
	it was hermione's scream that alerted him pettigrew had dived for lupin's dropped wand
	ron, unsteady on hisbandaged leg, fell
	there was a bang, a burst of light  and ron laymotionless on the ground
	another bang  crookshanks flew into the airand back to the earth in a heap
	harry yelled, pointing his own wand at pettigrewlupin's wand flew high into the air and out of sight
	stay where youare harry shouted, running forward
	pettigrew had transformed
	harry saw his bald tail whipthrough the manacle on ron's outstretched arm and heard a scurryingthrough the grass
	there was a howl and a rumbling growl harry turned to see the werewolftaking flight it was galloping into the forest sirius, he's gone, pettigrew transformed harry yelled
	black was bleeding there were gashes across his muzzle and back, but atharry's words he scrambled up again, and in an instant, the sound of hispaws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds
	harry and hermione dashed over to ron
	what did he do to him hermione whispered
	ron's eyes were onlyhalfclosed, his mouth hung open he was definitely alive, they couldhear him breathing, but he didn't seem to recognize them
	harry looked desperately around
	black and lupin both gone
	they hadno one but snape for company, still hanging, unconscious, in midair
	we'd better get them up to the castle and tell someone, said harry,pushing his hair out of his eyes, trying to think straight
	come but then, from beyond the range of their vision, they heard a yelping, awhining a dog in pain
	sirius, harry muttered, staring into the darkness
	he had a moment's indecision, but there was nothing they could do forron at the moment, and by the sound of it, black was in trouble harry set off at a run, hermione right behind him
	the yelping seemed tobe coming from the ground near the edge of the lake
	they pelted towardit, and harry, running flat out, felt the cold without realizing what itmust mean the yelping stopped abruptly
	as they reached the lakeshore, they sawwhy  sirius had turned back into a man
	he was crouched on all fours,his hands over his head
	and then harry saw them
	dementors, at least a hundred of them, glidingin a black mass around the lake toward them
	he spun around, thefamiliar, icy cold penetrating his insides, fog starting to obscure hisvision more were appearing out of the darkness on every side they wereencircling them
	herrnione, think of something happy harry yelled, raising his wand,blinking furiously to try and clear his vision, shaking his head to ridit of the faint screaming that had started inside it i'm going to live with my godfather
	i'm leaving the dursleys
	he forced himself to think of black, and only black, and began to chantexpecto patronum expecto patronumblack gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless on the ground,pale as death
	i'm going to go and live with him
	expecto patronum hermione, help me expecto patronumexpecto  hermione whispered, expecto  expecto but she couldn't do it
	the dementors were closing in, barely ten feetfrom them
	they formed a solid wall around harry and hermione, and weregetting closer
	expecto patronum harry yelled, trying to blot the screaming from hisears
	expecto patronuma thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him
	at the same moment, harry felt hermione collapse next to him
	expecto  expecto patronum harry felt his knees hit the cold grass
	fog was clouding his eyes
	witha huge effort, he fought to remember  sirius was innocent  innocent we'll be okay  i' mgoing to live with him ex ecto patronum he gasped
	by the feeble light of his formless patronus, he saw a dementor halt,very close to him
	it couldn't walk through the cloud of silver mistharry had conjured
	a dead, slimy hand slid out from under the cloak
	itmade a gesture as though to sweep the patronus aside
	expecto expecto patronumhe could feet them watching him, hear their rattling breath like an evilwind around him
	the nearest dementor seemed to be considering him
	thenit raised both its rotting hands  and lowered its hood
	where there should have been eyes, there was only thin, gray scabbedskin, stretched blankly over empty sockets
	but there was a mouth
	agaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a deathrattle
	a paralyzing terror filled harry so that he couldn't move or speak
	hispatronus flickered and died
	white fog was blinding him
	and in the distance, he heard the familiar screaming
	he groped in the mist for sirius, and found hisarm
	they weren't going to take him
	but a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly attached themselves aroundharry's neck
	they were forcing his face upward
	he could feel itsbreath
	it was going to get rid of him first
	he could feel itsputrid breath
	his mother was screaming in his ears
	she was goingto be the last thing he ever heard and then, through the fog that was drowning him, he thought he saw asilvery light growing brighter and brighter
	he felt himself fallforward onto the grass
	facedown, too weak to move, sick and shaking,harry opened his eyes
	the dementor must have released him
	the blindinglight was illuminating the grass around him
	the screaming hadstopped, the cold was ebbing away
	something was driving the dementors back
	it was circling around himand black and hermione
	the air was warm again
	with every ounce of strength he could muster, harry raised his head afew inches and saw an animal amid the light, galloping away across thelake
	eyes blurred with sweat, harry tried to make out what itwas
	it was as bright as a unicorn
	fighting to stay conscious,harry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore
	fora moment, harry saw, by its brightness, somebody welcoming it back
	raising his hand to pat it
	someone who looked strangely familiar
	harry didn't understand
	he couldn't think anymore
	he felt the last ofhis strength leave him, and his head hit the ground as he fainted
	chapter twentyonehermione's secretshocking business
	miracle none of them died
	by thunder, it was lucky you were there, snape
	order of merlin, second class, i'd say
	first class, if i can wangleitthank you very much indeed, minister
	nasty cut you've got there
	black's work, i supposeas a matter of fact, it was potter, weasley, and granger, minister
	noblack had bewitched them, i saw it immediately
	a confundus charm, tojudge by their behavior
	they seemed to think there was a possibility hewas innocent
	they weren't responsible for their actions
	on the otherhand, their interference might have permitted black to escape
	theyobviously thought they were going to catch black singlehanded
	they'vegot away with a great deal before now
	i'm afraid it's given them arather high opinion of themselves
	and of course potter has alwaysbeen allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster ah, well, snape
	harry potter, you know
	we've all got a bit of ablind spot where he's concerned
	and yet  is it good for him to be given so much special treatmentpersonally, i try and treat him like any other student
	and any otherstudent would be suspended  at the very least  for leading hisfriends into such danger
	consider, minister  against all school rules after all the precautions put in place for his protection outofbounds, at night, consorting with a werewolf and a murderer and i have reason to believe he has been visiting hogsmeade illegallytoo well, well
	we shall see, snape, we shall see
	the boy hasundoubtedly been foolish
	harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut
	thewords he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears tohis brain, so that it was difficult to understand
	his limbs feltlike lead his eyelids too heavy to lift
	he wanted to lie here, onthis comfortable bed, forever
	what amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors
	you've reallyno idea what made them retreat, snapeno, minister
	by the time i had come 'round they were heading back totheir positions at the entrances
	and yet black, and harry, and the girl all unconscious by the time i reached them
	i bound and gagged black,naturally, conjured stretchers, and brought them all straight back tothe castle
	harry's brain seemed to be moving a little faster,and as it did, a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach
	everything was slightly blurred
	somebody had removed his glasses
	hewas lying in the dark hospital wing
	at the very end of the ward, hecould make out madam pomfrey with her back to him, bending over a bed
	ron's red hair was visible beneath madam pomfrey's arm
	harry moved his head over on the pillow
	in the bed to his right layhermione
	moonlight was falling across her bed
	her eyes were open too
	she looked petrified, and when she saw that harry was awake, pressed afinger to her lips, then pointed to the hospital wing door
	it was ajar,and the voices of cornelius fudge and snape were coming through it fromthe corridor outside
	madam pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to harry's bed
	he turned to took at her
	she was carrying the largest block ofchocolate he had ever seen in his life
	it looked like a small boulder
	ah, you're awake she said briskly
	she placed the chocolate onharry's bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer
	how's ron said harry and hermione together
	he'll live, said madam pomfrey grimly
	as for you two you'll bestaying here until i'm satisfied you're  potter, what do you thinkyou're doingharry was sitting up, putting his glasses back on, and picking up hiswand
	i need to see the headmaster, he said
	potter, said madam pomfrey soothingly, it's all right
	he's locked away upstairs
	the dementors will be performing thekiss any moment now whatharry jumped up out of bed hermione had done the same
	but his shouthad been heard in the corridor outside next second, cornelius fudge andsnape had entered the ward
	harry, harry, what's this said fudge, looking agitated
	you shouldbe in bed  has he had any chocolate he asked madam pomfreyanxiously
	minister, listen harry said
	sirius black's innocent peterpettigrew faked his own death we saw him tonight you can't let thedementors do that thing to sirius, he's but fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face
	harry, harry, you're very confused, you've been through a dreadfulordeal, lie back down, now, we've got everything under control
	you haven't harry yelled
	youve got the wrong manminister, listen, please, hermione said she had hurried to harry'sside and was gazing imploringly into fudge's face
	itwas ron's rat, he's an animagus, pettigrew, i mean, and you see, minister said snape
	confunded, both of them
	black'sdone a very good job on them
	we're not confunded harry roared
	minister professor said madam pomfrey angrily
	i must insist thatyou leave
	potter is my patient, and he should not be distressedi'm not distressed, i'm trying to tell them what happened harry saidfuriously
	if they'd just listen but madam pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate intoharry's mouth he choked, and she seized the opportunity to force himback onto the bed
	now, please, minister, these children need care
	please leavethe door opened again
	harry swallowed his mouthfulof chocolate with great difficulty and got up again
	professor dumbledore, sirius black for heaven's sake said madam pomfrey hysterically
	is this ahospital wing or not headmaster, i must insist my apologies, poppy, but i need a word with mr
	potter and missgranger, said dumbledore calmly
	i have just been talking to siriusblack i suppose he's told you the same fairy tale he's planted in potter'smind spat snape
	something about a rat, and pettigrew being alive that, indeed, is black's story, said dumbledore, surveying snapeclosely through his halfmoon spectacles
	and does my evidence count for nothing snarled snape
	peterpettigrew was not in the shrieking shack, nor did i see any sign of himon the grounds
	that was because you were knocked out, professor said hermioneearnestly
	you didn't arrive in time to hearmiss granger, hold your tonguenow, snape, said fudge, startled, the young lady is disturbed in hermind, we must make allowances i would like to speak to harry and hermione alone, said dumbledoreabruptly
	cornelius, severus, poppy  please leave us
	headmaster sputtered madam pomfrey
	they need treatment, they needrest this cannot wait, said dumbledore
	madam pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the endof the ward, slamming the door behind her
	fudge consulted the largegold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat
	the dementors should have arrived by now, he said
	i'll go and meetthem
	dumbledore, i'll see you upstairs
	he crossed to the door and held it open for snape, but snape hadn'tmoved
	you surely don't believe a word of black's story snape whispered, hiseyes fixed on dumbledore's face
	i wish to speak to harry and hermione alone, dumbledore repeated
	snape took a step toward dumbledore
	sirius black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen, hebreathed
	you haven't forgotten that, headmaster you haven't forgottenthat he once tried to kill memy memory is as good as it ever was, severus, said dumbledore quietly
	snape turned on his heel and marched through the door fudge was stillholding
	it closed behind them, and dumbledore turned to harry andhermione
	they both burst into speech at the same time
	professor, black's telling the truth  we saw pettigrew  he escapedwhen professor lupin turned into a werewolf  he's a rat  pettigrew's front paw, i mean, finger, he cut it off  pettigrew attacked ron, it wasn't sirius but dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanations
	it is your turn to listen, and i beg you will not interrupt me, becausethere is very little time, he said quietly
	there is not a shred ofproof to support black's story, except your word  and the word of twothirteenyearold wizards will not convince anybody
	a street full ofeyewitnesses swore they saw sirius murder pettigrew
	i myself gaveevidence to the ministry that sirius had been the potters'secretkeeper
	professor lupin can tell you  harry said, unable to stop himselfprofessor lupin is currently deep in the forest, unable to tell anyoneanything
	by the time he is human again, it will be too late, siriuswill be worse than dead
	i might add that werewolves are so mistrustedby most of our kind that his support will count for very little  andthe fact that he and sirius are old friends but listen to me, harry
	it is too late, you understand me you must seethat professor snape's version of events is far more convincing thanyours
	he hates sirius, hermione said desperately
	all because of somestupid trick sirius played on him sirius has not acted like an innocent man
	the attack on the fat lady entering gryffindor tower with a knife  without pettigrew, alive ordead, we have no chance of overturning sirius's sentence
	yes, i do, said dumbledore quietly
	but i have no power to make othermen see the truth, or to overrule the minister of magic
	harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the groundbeneath him were falling sharply away
	he had grown used to the ideathat dumbledore could solve anything
	he had expected dumbledore to pullsome amazing solution out of the air
	their last hope wasgone
	what we need, said dumbledore slowly, and his light blue eyes movedfrom harry to hermione, is more time
	and then her eyes became very round
	ohnow, pay attention, said dumbledore, speaking very low, and veryclearly
	sirius is locked in professor flitwick's office on the seventhfloor
	thirteenth window from the right of the west tower
	if all goeswell, you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight
	butremember this, both of you you must not be seen
	miss granger, you knowthe law  you know what is at stake
	you  must  not  be seen
	harry didn't have a clue what was going on
	dumbledore had turned on hisheel and looked back as he reached the door
	i am going to lock you in
	it is  he consulted his watch, fiveminutes to midnight
	miss granger, three turns should do it
	good luck harry repeated as the door closed behind dumbledore
	threeturns what's he talking about what are we supposed to dobut hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes, pulling frombeneath them a very long, very fine gold chain
	harry, come here, she said urgently
	quickharry moved toward her, completely bewildered
	she was holding the chainout
	he saw a tiny, sparkling hourglass hanging from it
	here she had thrown the chain around his neck too
	ready she said breathlessly
	what are we doing harry said, completely lost
	hermione turned the hourglass over three times
	the dark ward dissolved
	harry had the sensation that he was flying veryfast, backward
	a blur of colors and shapes rushed past him, his earswere pounding, he tried to yell but couldn't hear his own voice and then he felt solid ground beneath his feet, and everything came intofocus again he was standing next to hermione in the deserted entrance hall and astream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from theopen front doors
	he looked wildly around at hermione, the chain of thehourglass cutting into his neck
	hermione, what in here hermione seized harry's arm and dragged him across the hallto the door of a broom closet she opened it, pushed him inside amongthe buckets and mops, then slammed the door behind them
	what  how  hermione, what happenedwe've gone back in time, hermione whispered, lifting the chain offharry's neck in the darkness
	harry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch
	it hurt a lot,which seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a verybizarre dream
	but shh listen someone's coming i think  i think it might be ushermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door
	footsteps across the hall
	yes, i think it's us going down tohagrid'sare you telling me, harry whispered, that we're here in this cupboardand we're out there tooyes, said hermione, her ear still glued to the cupboard door
	it doesn't sound like more than three people
	and we'rewalking slowly because we're under the invisibility cloak  she broke off, still listening intently
	we've gone down the front steps
	hermione sat down on an upturned bucket, looking desperately anxious,but harry wanted a few questions answered
	where did you get that hourglass thingit's called a timeturner, hermione whispered, and i got it fromprofessor mcgonagall on our first day back
	i've been using it all yearto get to all my lessons
	professor mcgonagall made me swear i wouldn'ttell anyone
	she had to write all sorts of letters to the ministry ofmagic so i could have one
	she had to tell them that i was a modelstudent, and that i'd never, ever use it for anything except mystudies
	i've been turning it back so i could do hours over again,that's how i've been doing several lessons at once, see but
	harry, i don't understand what dumbledore wants us to do
	why did hetell us to go back three hours how's that going to help siriusharry stared at her shadowy face
	there must be something that happened around now he wants us tochange, he said slowly
	what happened we were walking down tohagrid's three hours ago
	this is three hours ago, and we are walking down to hagrid's, saidhermione
	we just heard ourselves leaving
	harry frowned he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain inconcentration
	dumbledore just said  just said we could save more than one innocentlife
	hermione, we're going to save buckbeakbut  how will that help siriusdumbledore said  he just told us where the window is  the window offlitwick's office where they've got sirius locked up we've got to flybuckbeak up to the window and rescue sirius sirius can escape onbuckbeak  they can escape togetherfrom what harry could see of hermione's face, she looked terrified
	if we manage that without being seen, it'll be a miraclewell, we've got to try, haven't we said harry
	he stood up andpressed his ear against the door
	doesn't sound like anyone's there
	harry pushed open the closet door
	the entrance hall was deserted
	asquietly and quickly as they could, they darted out of the closet anddown the stone steps
	the shadows were already lengthening, the tops ofthe trees in the forbidden forest gilded once more with gold
	if anyone's looking out of the window  hermione squeaked, looking upat the castle behind them
	we'll run for it, said harry determinedly
	straight into the forest,all right we'll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep alookout okay, but we'll go around by the greenhouses said hermionebreathlessly
	we need to keep out of sight of hagrid's front door, orwe'll see us we must be nearly at hagrid's by nowstill working out what she meant, harry set off at a sprint, hermionebehind him
	they tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses,paused for a moment behind them, then set off again, fast as they could,skirting around the whomping willow, tearing toward the shelter of theforest
	safe in the shadows of the trees, harry turned around seconds later,hermione arrived beside him, panting
	we need to sneak over to hagrid's
	keep out ofsight, harry
	they made their way silently through the trees, keeping to the very edgeof the forest
	then, as they glimpsed the front of hagrid's house, theyheard a knock upon his door
	they moved quickly behind a wide oak trunkand peered out from either side
	hagrid had appeared in his doorway,shaking and white, looking around to see who had knocked
	and harryheard his own voice
	we're wearing the invisibility cloak
	let us in and we cantake it off
	yeh shouldn've come hagrid whispered
	he stood back, then shut thedoor quickly
	this is the weirdest thing we've ever done, harry said fervently
	let's move along a bit, hermione whispered
	we need to get nearer tobuckbeakthey crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff,tethered to the fence around hagrid's pumpkin patch
	if we steal him now, those committee people willthink hagrid set him free we've got to wait until they've seen he'stied outsidethat's going to give us about sixty seconds, said harry
	this wasstarting to seem impossible
	at that moment, there was a crash of breaking china from inside hagrid'scabin
	that's hagrid breaking the milk jug, hermione whispered
	i'm going tofind scabbers in a moment sure enough, a few minutes later, they heard hermione's shriek ofsurprise
	hermione, said harry suddenly, what if we  we just run in there andgrab pettigrew no said hermione in a terrified whisper
	don't you understand we'rebreaking one of the most important wizarding laws nobody's supposed tochange time, nobody you heard dumbledore, if we're seen we'd only be seen by ourselves and hagridharry, what do you think you'd do if you saw yourself bursting intohagrid's house said hermione
	i'd  i'd think i'd gone mad, said harry, or i'd think there wassome dark magic going on exactly you wouldn't understand, you might even attack yourself don'tyou see professor mcgonagall told me what awful things have happenedwhen wizards have meddled with time
	loads of them ended up killingtheir past or future selves by mistakeokay said harry
	it was just an idea, i just thoughtbut hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle
	harry moved hishead a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors
	dumbledore, fudge, the old committee member, and macnair the executionerwere coming down the steps
	we're about to come out hermione breathed
	and sure enough, moments later, hagrid's back door opened, and harry sawhimself, ron, and hermione walking out of it with hagrid
	it was,without a doubt, the strangest sensation of his life, standing behindthe tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch
	it's okay, beaky, it's okay
	hagrid said to buckbeak
	then he turnedto harry, ron, and hermione
	hagrid, we can't we'll tell them what really happenedthey can't kill him go it's bad enough without you lot in trouble an' allharry watched the hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the invisibilitycloak over him and ron
	there was a knock on hagrid's front door
	the execution party hadarrived
	hagrid turned, around and headed back into his cabin, leavingthe back door ajar
	harry watched the grass flatten in patches allaround the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating
	he, ron, andhermione had gone
	but the harry and hermione hidden in the treescould now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the backdoor
	where is the beast came the cold voice of macnair
	out  outside, hagrid croaked
	harry pulled his head out of sight as macnair's face appeared athagrid's window, staring out at buckbeak
	then they heard fudge
	we  er  have to read you the official notice of execution, hagrid
	and then you and macnair need to sign it
	macnair,you're supposed to listen too, that's procedure macnair's face vanished from the window
	wait here, harry whispered to hermione
	as fudge's voice started again, harry darted out from behind his tree,vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached buckbeak
	it is the decision of the committee for the disposal of dangerouscreatures that the hippogriff buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned,shall he executed on the sixth of june at sundown careful not to blink, harry stared up into buckbeak's fierce orange eyesonce more and bowed
	buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood upagain
	harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying buckbeak to thefence
	sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by thecommittee's appointed executioner, walden macnai
	come on, buckbeak, harry murmured, come on, we're going to help you
	hagrid, you sign here
	harry threw all his weight onto the rope, but buckbeak had dug in hisfront feet
	well, let's get this over with, said the reedy voice of the committeemember from inside hagrid's cabin
	hagrid, perhaps it will be better ifyou stay inside no, i  i wan' ter be with him
	i don' wan' him ter be alone footsteps echoed from within the cabin
	buckbeak, move harry hissed
	harry tugged harder on the rope around buckbeak's neck
	the hippogriffbegan to walk, rustling its wings irritably
	they were still ten feetaway from the forest, in plain view of hagrid's back door
	one moment,please, macnair, came dumbledore's voice
	you need to sign too
	thefootsteps stopped
	harry heaved on the rope
	buckbeak snapped his beakand walked a little faster
	hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree
	harry, hurry she mouthed
	harry could still hear dumbledore's voice talking from within the cabin
	he gave the rope another wrench
	buckbeak broke into a grudging trot
	they had reached the trees
	quick quick hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree,seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make buckbeak move faster
	harry looked over his shoulder they were now blocked from sight theycouldn't see hagrid's garden at all
	stop he whispered to hermione
	they might hear ushagrid's back door had opened with a bang
	harry, hermione, and buckbeakstood quite still even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently
	then where is it said the reedy voice of the committee member
	where isthe beastit was tied here said the executioner furiously
	i saw it justherehow extraordinary, said dumbledore
	there was a note of amusement inhis voice
	beaky said hagrid huskily
	there was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe
	the executionerseemed to have swung it into the fence in anger
	and then came thehowling, and this time they could hear hagrid's words through his sobs
	gone gone bless his little beak, he's gone musta pulled himselffree beaky, yeh clever boybuckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back tohagrid
	harry and hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels intothe forest floor to stop him
	someone untied him the executioner was snarling
	we should searchthe grounds, the forest
	macnair, if buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really think thethief will have led him away on foot said dumbledore, still soundingamused
	search the skies, if you will
	hagrid, i could do with a cupof tea
	o'  o' course, professor, said hagrid, who sounded weak withhappiness
	harry and hermione listened closely
	they heard footsteps, the softcursing of the executioner, the snap of the door, and then silence oncemore
	now what whispered harry, looking around
	we'll have to hide in here, said hermione, who looked very shaken
	weneed to wait until they've gone back to the castle
	then we wait untilit's safe to fly buckbeak up to sirius's window
	he won't be there foranother couple of hours
	oh, this is going to be difficult
	she looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest
	the sun was setting now
	we're going to have to move, said harry, thinking hard
	we've got tobe able to see the whomping willow, or we won't know what's going on
	okay, said hermione, getting a firmer grip on buckbeak's rope
	butwe've got to keep out of sight, harry, remember
	they moved around the edge of the forest, darkness falling thicklyaround them, until they were hidden behind a clump of trees throughwhich they could make out the willow
	there's ron said harry suddenly
	a dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed throughthe still night air
	get away from him  get away  scabbers, come here and then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere
	harrywatched himself and hermione chasing after ron
	then he saw ron dive
	gotcha get off, you stinking cat there's sirius said harry
	the great shape of the dog had bounded outfrom the roots of the willow
	they saw him bowl harry over, then seizeron
	looks even worse from here, doesn't it said harry, watching the dogpulling ron into the roots
	ouch  look, i just got walloped by thetree  and so did you  this is weirdthe whomping willow was creaking and lashing out with its lowerbranches they could see themselves darting here and there, trying toreach the trunk
	and then the tree froze
	that was crookshanks pressing the knot, said hermione
	the moment they disappeared, the tree began to move again
	secondslater, they heard footsteps quite close by
	dumbledore, macnair, fudge,and the old committee member were making their way up to the castle
	right after we'd gone down into the passage said hermione
	if onlydumbledore had come with us
	macnair and fudge would've come too, said harry bitterly
	i bet youanything fudge would've told macnair to murder sirius on the spot
	they watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear fromview
	for a few minutes the scene was deserted
	then here comes lupin said harry as they saw another figure sprinting downthe stone steps and hating toward the willow
	harry looked up at thesky
	clouds were obscuring the moon completely
	they watched lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod theknot on the trunk
	the tree stopped fighting, and lupin, too,disappeared into the gap in its roots
	if he'd only grabbed the cloak, said harry
	it's just lyingthere
	he turned to hermione
	if i just dashed out now and grabbed it, snape'd never be able to getit and harry, we mustn't be seenhow can you stand this he asked hermione fiercely
	just standinghere and watching it happen he hesitated
	i'm going to grab thecloakharry, nohermione seized the back of harry's robes not a moment too soon
	justthen, they heard a burst of song
	it was hagrid, making his way up tothe castle, singing at the top of his voice, and weaving slightly as hewalked
	a large bottle was swinging from his hands
	see hermione whispered
	see what would have happened we've got tokeep out of sight no, buckbeakthe hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to hagrid again harryseized his rope too, straining to hold buckbeak back
	they watchedhagrid meander tipsily up to the castle
	buckbeak stoppedfighting to get away
	his head drooped sadly
	barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, andsnape came charging out of them, running toward the willow
	harry's fists clenched as they watched snape skid to a halt next to thetree, looking around
	he grabbed the cloak and held it up
	get your filthy hands off it, harry snarled under his breath
	shhsnape seized the branch lupin had used to freeze the tree, prodded theknot, and vanished from view as he put on the cloak
	so that's it, said hermione quietly
	we're all down there
	and nowwe've just got to wait until we come back up again
	she took the end of buckbeak's rope and tied it securely around thenearest tree, then sat down on the dry ground, arms around her knees
	harry, there's something i don't understand
	why didn't thedementors get sirius i remember them coming, and then i think i passedout
	there were so many of them
	he explained what he'd seen how, as the nearestdementor had lowered its mouth to harry's, a large silver something hadcome galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat
	hermione's mouth was slightly open by the time harry had finished
	but what was itthere's only one thing it could have been, to make the dementors go,said harry
	but who conjured itharry didn't say anything
	he was thinking back to the person he'd seenon the other bank of the lake
	he knew who he thought it had been
	buthow could it have beendidn't you see what they looked like said hermione eagerly
	was itone of the teachersno, said harry
	but it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all thosedementors away
	if the patronus was shining so brightly, didn't itlight him up couldn't you see yeah, i saw him, said harry slowly
	iwasn't thinking straight
	i passed out right afterward
	who did you think it wasi think  harry swallowed, knowing how strange this was going tosound
	i think it was my dad
	harry glanced up at hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now
	she was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity
	harry, your dad's  well  dead, she said quietly
	i know that, said harry quickly
	you think you saw his ghosti don't know
	but then maybe i was seeing things, said harry
	from what i couldsee
	i've got photos of him
	hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity
	i know it sounds crazy, said harry flatly
	he turned to took atbuckbeak, who was digging his beak into the ground, apparently searchingfor worms
	but he wasn't really watching buckbeak
	he was thinking about his father and about his father's three oldestfriends
	moony, wormtail, padfoot, and prongs
	had all four of thembeen out on the grounds tonight wormtail had reappeared this eveningwhen everyone had thought he was dead
	was it so impossible hisfather had done the same had he been seeing things across the take thefigure had been too far away to see distinctly
	yet he had felt sure,for a moment, before he'd lost consciousness
	the leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze
	the moon drifted inand out of sight behind the shifting clouds
	hermione sat with her faceturned toward the willow, waiting
	and then, at last, after over an hour
	here we come hermione whispered
	she and harry got to their feet
	buckbeak raised his head
	they sawlupin, ron, and pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in theroots
	then the unconscious snape, driftingweirdly upward
	next came harry and black
	they all began to walk towardthe castle
	harry's heart was starting to beat very fast
	he glanced up at the sky
	any moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon
	harry, hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he wasthinking, we've got to stay put
	there's nothing wecan do
	so we're just going to let pettigrew escape all over again
	how do you expect to find a rat in the dark snapped hermione
	there's nothing we can do we came back to help sirius we're notsupposed to be doing anything elseall rightthe moon slid out from behind its cloud
	they saw the tiny figuresacross the grounds stop
	then they saw movement there goes lupin, hermione whispered
	he's transforminghermione said harry suddenly
	we've got to movewe mustn't, i keep telling you not to interfere lupin's going to run into the forest, right at ushermione gasped
	quick she moaned, dashing to untie buckbeak
	quick where are wegoing to go where are we going to hide the dementors wilt be comingany moment back to hagrid's harry said
	it's empty now  come onthey ran as fast as they could, buckbeak cantering along behind them
	they could hear the werewolf howling behind them
	the cabin was in sight harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, andhermione and buckbeak flashed past him harry threw himself in afterthem and bolted the door
	fang the boarhound barked loudly
	shh, fang, it's us said hermione, hurrying over and scratching hisears to quieten him
	that was really close she said to harry
	harry was looking out of the window
	it was much harder to see what wasgoing on from here
	buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself backinside hagrid's house
	he lay down in front of the fire, folded hiswings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good nap
	i think i'd better go outside again, you know, said harry slowly
	ican't see what's going on  we won't know when it's time hermione looked up
	her expression was suspicious
	i'm not going to try and interfere, said harry quickly
	but if wedon't see what's going on, how're we going to know when it's time torescue siriuswell
	i'll wait here with buckbeak
	but harry, becareful  there's a werewolf out there  and the dementorsharry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin
	he could hearyelping in the distance
	that meant the dementors were closing in onsirius
	he and hermione would be running to him any moment
	harry stared out toward the lake, his heart doing a kind of drumroll inhis chest
	whoever had sent that patronus would be appearing at anymoment
	for a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front of hagrid'sdoor
	you must not be seen
	but he didn't want to be seen
	he wanted todo the seeing
	and there were the dementors
	they were emerging out of the darknessfrom every direction, gliding around the edges of the lake
	they weremoving away from where harry stood, to the opposite bank
	he wouldn'thave to get near them
	he had no thought in his head except his father
	if it really was him
	he had to know, had to findout
	the lake was coming nearer and nearer, but there was no sign of anybody
	on the opposite bank, he could see tiny glimmers of silver  his ownattempts at a patronus there was a bush at the very edge of the water
	harry threw himselfbehind it, peering desperately through the leaves
	on the opposite bank,the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished
	a terrifiedexcitement shot through him  any moment now come on he muttered, staring about
	where are you dad, come on but no one came
	harry raised his head to look at the circle ofdementors across the lake
	one of them was lowering its hood
	it wastime for the rescuer to appear  but no one was coming to help thistime and then it hit him  he understood
	he hadn't seen his father  hehad seen himself harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand
	expecto patronum he yelled
	and out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, buta blinding, dazzling, silver animal
	he screwed up his eyes, trying tosee what it was
	it looked like a horse
	it was galloping silently awayfrom him, across the black surface of the lake
	he saw it lower its headand charge at the swarming dementors
	now it was galloping around andaround the black shapes on the ground, and the dementors were fallingback, scattering, retreating into the darkness
	it was cantering back toward harry across the stillsurface of the water
	it wasn't a unicorn, either
	it was shining brightly as the moon above
	it was comingback to him
	it stopped on the bank
	its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as itstared at harry with its large, silver eyes
	slowly, it bowed itsantlered head
	prongs, he whispered
	but as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature, itvanished
	harry stood there, hand still outstretched
	then, with a great leap ofhis heart, he heard hooves behind him he whirled around and sawhermione dashing toward him, dragging buckbeak behind her
	what did you do she said fiercely
	you said you were only going tokeep a lookouti just saved all our lives
	get behind here  behindthis bush  i'll explain
	hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yetagain
	did anyone see youyes, haven't you been listening i saw me but i thought i was my dadit's okayharry, i can't believe it
	you conjured up a patronus that droveaway all those dementors that's very, very advanced magic
	i knew icould do it this time, said harry, because i'd already done it
	does that make sensei don't know  harry, look at snapetogether they peered around the bush at the other bank
	snape hadregained consciousness
	he was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limpforms of harry, hermione, and black onto them
	a fourth stretcher, nodoubt bearing ron, was already floating at his side
	then, wand held outin front of him, he moved them away toward the castle
	right, it's nearly time, said hermione tensely, looking at her watch
	we've got about fortyfive minutes until dumbledore locks the door tothe hospital wing
	we've got to rescue sirius and get back into the wardbefore anybody realizes we're missing
	11they waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake, while thebush next to them whispered in the breeze
	buckbeak, bored, wasferreting for worms again
	d' you reckon he's up there yet said harry, checking his watch
	helooked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right ofthe west tower
	look hermione whispered
	who's that someone's coming back out ofthe castleharry stared through the darkness
	the man was hurrying across thegrounds, toward one of the entrances
	something shiny glinted in hisbelt
	the executioner he's gone to get the dementorsthis is it, hermione hermione put her hands on buckbeak's back and harry gave her a leg up
	then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush andclimbed up in front of her
	he pulled buckbeak's rope back over his neckand tied it to the other side of his collar like reins
	ready he whispered to hermione
	yotm better hold on to me he nudged buckbeak's sides with his heels
	buckbeak soared straight into the dark air
	harry gripped his flankswith his knees, feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them
	hermione was holding harry very tight around the waist he could hearher muttering, oh, no  i don't like this oh, i really don't like thisharry urged buckbeak forward
	they were gliding quietly toward the upperfloors of the castle
	harry pulled hard on the lefthand side of therope, and buckbeak turned
	harry was trying to count the windowsflashing past whoa he said, pulling backward as hard as he could
	buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop, unless youcounted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as thehippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne
	he's there harry said, spotting sirius as they rose up beside thewindow
	he reached out, and as buckbeak's wings fell, was able to tapsharply on the glass
	harry saw his jaw drop
	he leapt from his chair,hurried to the window and tried to open it, but it was locked
	stand back hermione called to him, and she took out her wand, stillgripping the back of harry's robes with her left hand
	alohomorathe window sprang open
	how  how  said black weakly, staring at the hippogriffget on  there's not much time, said harry, gripping buckbeak firmlyon either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady
	you've got to getout of here the dementors are coming  macnair's gone to get them
	black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved hishead and shoulders out of it
	it was very lucky he was so thin
	inseconds, he had managed to fling one leg over buckbeak's back and pullhimself onto the hippogriff behind hermione
	okay, buckbeak, up said harry, shaking the rope
	up to the tower come on
	the hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaringupward again, high as the top of the west tower
	buckbeak landed with aclatter on the battlements, and harry and hermione slid off him at once
	sirius, you'd better go, quick, harry panted
	they'll reachflitwick's office any moment, they'll find out you're gone
	buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head
	what happened to the other boy ron croaked sirius
	he's going to be okay
	he's still out of it, but madam pomfrey saysshe'll be able to make him better
	quick  go but black was still staring down at harry
	how can i ever thank go harry and hermione shouted together
	black wheeled buckbeak around, facing the open sky
	we'll see each other again, he said
	you are  truly your father'sson, harry
	he squeezed buckbeak's sides with his heels
	harry and hermione jumpedback as the enormous wings rose once more
	the hippogriff took offinto the air
	he and his rider became smaller and smaller as harrygazed after them
	then a cloud drifted across the moon
	chapter twentytwoowl post againharryhermione was tugging at his sleeve, staring at her watch
	we've gotexactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing withoutanybody seeing us  before dumbledore locks the door okay, said harry, wrenching his gaze from the sky, let's go
	they slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightlyspiraling stone staircase
	as they reached the bottom of it, they heardvoices
	they flattened themselves against the wall and listened
	itsounded like fudge and snape
	they were walking quickly along thecorridor at the foot of the staircase
	only hope dumbledore's not going to make difficulties, snape wassaying
	the kiss will be performed immediatelyas soon as macnair returns with the dementors
	this whole black affairhas been highly embarrassing
	i can't tell you how much i'm lookingforward to informing the daily prophet that we've got him at last
	idaresay they'll want to interview you, snape
	and once young harry'sback in his right mind, i expect he'll want to tell the prophet exactlyhow you saved him
	harry clenched his teeth
	he caught a glimpse of snape's smirk as he andfudge passed harry and hermione's hiding place
	their footsteps diedaway
	harry and hermione waited a few moments to make sure they'd reallygone, then started to run in the opposite direction
	down one staircase,then another, along a new ,corridor  then they heard a cackling ahead
	peeves harry muttered, grabbing hermione's wrist
	in herethey tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time
	peevesseemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits,laughing his head off
	oh, he's horrible, whispered hermione, her ear to the door
	i bethe's all excited because the dementors are going to finish offsirius
	she checked her watch
	three minutes, harrythey waited until peeves's gloating voice had faded into the distance,then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again
	hermione  what'll happen  if we don't get back inside beforedumbledore locks the door harry panted
	i don't want to think about it hermione moaned, checking her watchagain
	one minutethey had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wingentrance
	okay  i can hear dumbledore, said hermione tensely
	comeon, harrythey crept along the corridor
	dumbledore's backappeared
	i am going to lock you in, they heard him saying
	it is five minutesto midnight
	miss granger, three turns should do it
	dumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door, and took out hiswand to magically lock it
	panicking, harry and hermione ran forward
	dumbledore looked up, and a wide smile appeared under the long silvermustache
	well he said quietly
	we did it said harry breathlessly
	sirius has gone, on buckbeak
	dumbledore beamed at them
	i think  he listened intently for any sound within thehospital wing
	yes, i think you've gone too  get inside  i'll lockyou in harry and hermione slipped back inside the dormitory
	it was emptyexcept for ron, who was still lying motionless in the end bed
	as thelock clicked behind them, harry and hermione crept back to their ownbeds, hermione tucking the timeturner back under her robes
	a momentlater, madam pomfrey came striding back out of her office
	did i hear the headmaster leaving am i allowed to look after mypatients nowshe was in a very bad mood
	harry and hermione thought it best to accepttheir chocolate quietly
	madam pomfrey stood over them, making sure theyate it
	but harry could hardly swallow
	he and hermione were waiting,listening, their nerves jangling
	and then, as they both took afourth piece of chocolate from madam pomfrey, they heard a distant roarof fury echoing from somewhere above them
	what was that said madam pomfrey in alarm
	now they could hear angry voices, growing louder and louder
	madampomfrey was staring at the door
	really  they'll wake everybody up what do they think they're doingharry was trying to hear what the voices were saying
	they were drawingnearer he must have disapparated, severus
	we should have left somebody in theroom with him
	when this gets out he didn't disapparate snape roared, now very close at hand
	youcan't apparate or disapparate inside this castle this  has something  to  do  with  potterseverus  be reasonable  harry has been locked up bam
	the door of the hospital wing burst open
	fudge, snape, and dumbledore came striding into the ward
	dumbledorealone looked calm
	indeed, he looked as though he was quite enjoyinghimself
	fudge appeared angry
	but snape was beside himself
	out with it, potter he bellowed
	what did you doprofessor snape shrieked madam pomfrey
	control yourselfsee here, snape, be reasonable, said fudge
	this door's been locked,we just saw they helped him escape, i know it snape howled, pointing at harry andhermione
	his face was twisted spit was flying from his mouth
	calm down, man fudge barked
	you're talking nonsenseyou don't know potter shrieked snape
	he did it, i know he did itthat will do, severus, said dumbledore quietly
	think about what youare saying
	this door has been locked since i left the ward ten minutesago
	madam pomfrey, have these students left their bedsof course not said madam pomfrey, bristling
	i would have heardthemwell, there you have it, severus, said dumbledore calmly
	unless youare suggesting that harry and hermione are able to be in two places atonce, i'm afraid i don't see any point in troubling them further
	snape stood there, seething, staring from fudge, who looked thoroughlyshocked at his behavior, to dumbledore, whose eyes were twinkling behindhis glasses
	snape whirled about, robes swishing behind him, and stormedout of the ward
	fellow seems quite unbalanced, said fudge, staring after him
	i'dwatch out for him if i were you, dumbledore
	oh, he's not unbalanced, said dumbledore quietly
	he's just suffereda severe disappointment
	he's not the only one puffed fudge
	the daily prophet's going tohave a field day we had black cornered and he slipped through ourfingers yet again all it needs now is for the story of thathippogriff's escape to get out, and i'll be a laughingstock well
	i'dbetter go and notify the ministry
	and the dementors said dumbledore
	they'll be removed from theschool, i trustoh yes, they'll have to go, said fudge, running his fingersdistractedly through his hair
	never dreamed they'd attempt toadminister the kiss on an innocent boy
	completely out of control
	no, i'll have them packed off back to azkaban tonight
	perhaps weshould think about dragons at the school entrance
	hagrid would like that, said dumbledore, smiling at harry andhermione
	as he and fudge left the dormitory, madam pomfrey hurried tothe door and locked it again
	muttering angrily to herself, she headedback to her office
	there was a low moan from the other end of the ward
	they could see him sitting up, rubbing his head, looking around
	what  what happened he groaned
	harry why are we in here where'ssirius where's lupin what's going onharry and hermione looked at each other
	you explain, said harry, helping himself to some more chocolate
	when harry, ron, and hermione left the hospital wing at noon the nextday, it was to find an almost deserted castle
	the sweltering, heat andthe end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage ofanother hogsmeade visit
	neither ron nor hermione felt like going,however, so they and harry wandered onto the grounds, still talkingabout the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering wheresirius and buckbeak were now
	sitting near the lake, watching the giantsquid waving its tentacles lazily above the water, harry lost the threadof the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank
	the staghad galloped toward him from there just last night
	a shadow fell across them and they looked 'tip to see a very blearyeyedhagrid, mopping his sweaty face with one of his tableclothsizedhandkerchiefs and beaming down at them
	know i shouldn' feel happy, after wha' happened las' night, he said
	i mean, black escapin' again, an, everythin'  but guess whatwhat they said, pretending to look curious
	beaky he escaped he's free bin celebratin' all nightthat's wonderful said hermione, giving ron a reproving look becausehe looked as though he was close to laughing
	can't've tied him up properly, said hagrid, gazing happily outover the grounds
	i was worried this mornin', mind
	thought he mightamet professor lupin on the grounds, but lupin says he never ate anythin'las' night
	what said harry quickly
	blimey, haven' yeh heard said hagrid, his smile fading a little
	helowered his voice, even though there was nobody in sight
	er  snapetold all the slytherins this mornin'
	thought everyone'd know bynow
	professor lupin's a werewolf, see
	an' he was loose on thegrounds las' night
	he's packin' now, o' course
	he's packing said harry, alarmed
	whyleavin', isn' he said hagrid, looking surprised that harry had toask
	resigned firs' thing this mornin'
	says he can't risk it happeninagain
	harry scrambled to his feet
	i'm going to see him, he said to ron and hermione
	but if he's resigned  doesn't sound like there's anything we can do i don't care
	i still want to see him
	i'll meet you back here
	lupin's office door was open
	he had already packed most of his things
	the grindylow's empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase,which was open and nearly full
	lupin was bending over something on hisdesk and looked up only when harry knocked on the door
	i saw you coming, said lupin, smiling
	he pointed to the parchment hehad been poring over
	it was the marauder's map
	i just saw hagrid, said harry
	and he said you'd resigned
	it's nottrue, is iti'm afraid it is, said lupin
	he started opening his desk drawers andtaking out the contents
	the ministry of magic don't think you were helpingsirius, do theylupin crossed to the door and closed it behind harry
	professor dumbledore managed to convince fudge that i was trying tosave your lives
	that was the final straw for severus
	ithink the loss of the order of merlin hit him hard
	so he  er accidentally let slip that i am a werewolf this morning at breakfast
	you're not leaving just because of that said harry
	this time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents
	theywill not want a werewolf teaching their children, harry
	and after lastnight, i see their point
	i could have bitten any of you
	that mustnever happen again
	you're the best defense against the dark arts teacher we've ever hadsaid harry
	don't golupin shook his head and didn't speak
	he carried on emptying hisdrawers
	then, while harry was trying to think of a good argument tomake him stay, lupin said, from what the headmaster told me thismorning, you saved a lot of lives last night, harry
	if i'm proud ofanything i've done this year, it's how much you've learned
	tell meabout your patronus
	how d'you know about that said harry, distracted
	what else could have driven the dementors backharry told lupin what had happened
	when he'd finished, lupin wassmiling again
	yes, your father was always a stag when he transformed, he said
	that's why we called him prongs
	lupin threw his last few books into his case, closed the desk drawers,and turned to look at harry
	here  i brought this from the shrieking shack last night, he said,handing harry back the invisibility cloak
	he hesitated, thenheld out the marauder's map too
	i am no longer your teacher, so idon't feel guilty about giving you back this as well
	it's no use to me,and i daresay you, ron, and hermione will find uses for it
	harry took the map and grinned
	you told me moony, wormtail, padfoot, and prongs would've wanted tolure me out of school
	you said they'd have thought it was funny
	and so we would have, said lupin, now reaching down to close his case
	i have no hesitation in saying that james would have been highlydisappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages outof the castle
	there was a knock on the door
	harry hastily stuffed the marauder's mapand the invisibility cloak into his pocket
	it was professor dumbledore
	he didn't look surprised to see harrythere
	your carriage is at the gates, remus, he said
	thank you, headmaster
	lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank
	well  goodbye, harry, he said, smiling
	it has been a realpleasure teaching you
	i feel sure we'll meet again sometime
	headmaster, there is no need to see me to the gates, i can manage
	harry had the impression that lupin wanted to leave as quickly aspossible
	goodbye, then, remus, said dumbledore soberly
	lupin shifted thegrindylow tank slightly so that he and dumbledore could shake hands
	then, with a final nod to harry and a swift smile, lupin left theoffice
	harry sat down in his vacated chair, staring glumly at the floor
	heheard the door close and looked up
	dumbledore was still there
	why so miserable, harry he said quietly
	you should be very proud ofyourself after last night
	it didn't make any difference, said harry bitterly
	didn't make any difference said dumbledore quietly, it made all thedifference in the world, harry
	you helped uncover the truth
	you savedan innocent man from a terrible fate
	something stirred in harry's memory
	greater and more terriblethan ever before
	professor trelawney's predictionprofessor dumbledore  yesterday, when i was having my divinationexam, professor trelawney went very  very strange
	indeed said dumbledore
	er  stranger than usual, you meanyes
	her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said
	shesaid voldemort's servant was going to set out to return to him beforemidnight
	she said the servant would help him come back to power
	harry stared up at dumbledore
	and then she sort of became normalagain, and she couldn't remember anything she'd said
	was it  was shemaking a real predictiondumbledore looked mildly impressed
	do you know, harry, i think she might have been
	he said thoughtfully
	who'd have thought it that brings her total of real predictions up totwo
	i should offer her a pay raise
	but  harry looked at him, aghast
	how could dumbledore take this socalmlybut  i stopped sirius and professor lupin from killing pettigrewthat makes it my fault if voldemort comes backit does not, said dumbledore quietly
	hasn't your experience with thetimeturner taught you anything, harry the consequences of our actionsare always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is avery difficult business indeed
	professor trelawney, bless her, isliving proof of that
	you did a very noble thing, in savingpettigrew's life
	but if he helps voldemort back to powerpettigrew owes his life to you
	you have sent voldemort a deputy who isin your debt
	when one wizard saves another wizard's life, it createsa certain bond between them
	and i'm much mistaken if voldemort wantshis servant in the debt of harry potter
	i don't want a connection with pettigrew said harry
	he betrayed myparentsthis is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, harry
	the time may come when you will be very glad you saved pettigrew'slife
	harry couldn't imagine when that would be
	dumbledore looked as thoughhe knew what harry was thinking
	i knew your father very well, both at hogwarts and later, harry, hesaid gently
	he would have saved pettigrew too, i am sure of it
	harry looked up at him
	dumbledore wouldn't laugh  he could telldumbledore
	i thought it was my dad who'd conjured my patronus
	i mean, when i sawmyself across the lake
	i thought i was seeing him
	an easy mistaketo make, said dumbledore softly
	i expect you'll tire of hearing it,but you do look extraordinarily like james
	youhave your mother's eyes
	it was stupid, thinking it was him, he muttered
	i mean, i knew hewas dead
	you think the dead we loved ever truly leave us you think that wedon't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble yourfather is alive in you, harry, and shows himself most plainly when youhave need of him
	how else could you produce that particular patronusprongs rode again last night
	it took a moment for harry to realize what dumblefore had said
	last night sirius told me all about how they became animagi, saiddumbledore, smiling
	an extraordinary achievement  not least, keepingit quiet from me
	and then i remembered the most unusual form yourpatronus took, when it charged mr
	malfoy down at your quidditch matchagainst ravenclaw
	you know, harry, in a way, you did see your fatherlast night
	you found him inside yourself
	and dumbledore left the office, leaving harry to his very confusedthoughts
	nobody at hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the nightthat sirius, buckbeak, and pettigrew had vanished except harry, ron,hermione, and professor dumbledore
	as the end of term approached, harryheard many different theories about what had really happened, but noneof them came close to the truth
	malfoy was furious about buckbeak
	he was convinced that hagrid hadfound a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety, and seemed outragedthat he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper
	percyweasley, meanwhile, had much to say on the subject of sirius's escape
	if i manage to get into the ministry, i'll have a lot of proposals tomake about magical law enforcement he told the only person who wouldlisten  his girlfriend, penelope
	though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was socheerful, though he knew they had achieved the near impossible inhelping sirius to freedom, harry had never approached the end of aschool year in worse spirits
	he certainly wasn't the only one who was sorry to see professor lupingo
	the whole of harry's defense against the dark arts class wasmiserable about his resignation
	wonder what they'll give us next year said seamus finnigan gloomily
	maybe a vampire, suggested dean thomas hopefully
	it wasn't only professor lupin's departure that was weighing on harry'smind
	he couldn't help thinking a lot about professor trelawney'sprediction
	he kept wondering where pettigrew was now, whether he hadsought sanctuary with voldemort yet
	but the thing that was loweringharry's spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to thedursleys
	for maybe half an hour, a glorious half hour, he had believedhe would be living with sirius from now on
	his parents' bestfriend
	it would have been the next best thing to having his ownfather back
	and while no news of sirius was definitely good news,because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding, harry couldn'thelp feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have had,and the fact that it was now impossible
	the exam results came out on the last day of term
	harry, ron, andhermione had passed every subject
	harry was amazed that he had gotthrough potions
	he had a shrewd suspicion that dumbledore might havestepped in to stop snape failing him on purpose
	snape's behavior towardharry over the past week had been quite alarming
	harry wouldn't havethought it possible that snape's dislike for him could increase, but itcertainly had
	a muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of snape'sthin mouth every time he looked at harry, and he was constantly flexinghis fingers, as though itching to place them around harry's throat
	percy had got his topgrade n
	s fred and george had scraped ahandful of o
	gryffindor house, meanwhile, largely thanks totheir spectacular performance in the quidditch cup, had won the housechampionship for the third year running
	this meant that the end of termfeast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold, and that thegryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot, as everybody celebrated
	even harry managed to forget about the journey back to the dursleys thenext day as he ate, drank, talked, and laughed with the rest
	as the hogwarts express pulled out of the station the next morning,hermione gave harry and ron some surprising news
	i went to see professor mcgonagall this morning, just before breakfast
	i've decided to drop muggle studies
	but you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent saidron
	i know, sighed hermione, but i can't stand another year like thisone
	that timeturner, it was driving me mad
	withoutmuggle studies and divination, i'll be able to have a normal scheduleagain
	i still can't believe you didn't tell us about it, said ron grumpily
	we're supposed to be your friends
	i promised i wouldn't tell anyone, said hermione severely
	she lookedaround at harry, who was watching hogwarts disappear from view behind amountain
	two whole months before he'd see it again
	oh, cheer up, harry said hermione sadly
	i'm okay, said harry quickly
	just thinking about the holidays
	yeah, i've been thinking about them too, said ron
	harry, you've gotto come and stay with us
	i'll fix it up with mum and dad, then i'llcall you
	i know how to use a fellytone now a telephone, ron, said hermione
	honestly, you should take mugglestudies next year
	it's the quidditch world cup this summer how about it, harry come andstay, and we'll go and see it dad can usually get tickets from work
	this proposal had the effect of cheering harry up a great deal
	i bet the dursleys'd be pleased to let me come
	especiallyafter what i did to aunt marge
	feeling considerably more cheerful, harry joined ron and hermione inseveral games of exploding snap, and when the witch with the tea cartarrived, he bought himself a very large lunch, though nothing withchocolate in it
	but it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him trulyhappy turned up
	harry, said hermione suddenly, peering over his shoulder
	what's thatthing outside your windowharry turned to look outside
	something very small and gray was bobbingin and out of sight beyond the glass
	he stood up for a better look andsaw that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big forit
	the owl was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in theair, buffeted this way and that in the train's slipstream
	harry quicklypulled down the window, stretched out his arm, and caught it
	it feltlike a very fluffy snitch
	he brought it carefully inside
	the owldropped its letter onto harry's seat and began zooming around theircompartment, apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing itstask
	hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapproval
	crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great yelloweyes
	ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm's way
	harry picked up the letter
	it was addressed to him
	he ripped open theletter, and shouted, it's from siriuswhat said ron and hermione excitedly
	read it alouddear harry,i hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle
	i don't knowwhether they're used to owl post
	buckbeak and i are in hiding
	i won't tell you where, in case this owlfalls into the wrong hands
	i have some doubt about his reliability, buthe is the best i could find, and he did seem eager for the job
	i believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven't ahope of finding me here
	i am planning to allow some muggles to glimpseme soon, a long way from hogwarts, so that the security on the castlewill be lifted
	there is something i never got around to telling you during our briefmeeting
	it was i who sent you the firebolt ha said hermione triumphantly
	see i told you it was from himyes, but he hadn't jinxed it, had he said ron
	ouch the tiny owl,now hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of his fingers in whatit seemed to think was an affectionate way
	crookshanks took the order to the owl office for me
	i used your namebut told them to take the gold from my own gringotts vault
	pleaseconsider it as thirteen birthdays' worth of presents from yourgodfather
	i would also like to apologize for the fright i think i gave you thatnight last year when you left your uncle's house
	i had only hoped toget a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but i think thesight of me alarmed you
	i am enclosing something else for you, which i think will make your nextyear at hogwarts more enjoyable
	if ever you need me, send word
	your owl will find me
	i'll write again soon
	siriusharry looked eagerly inside the envelope
	there was another piece ofparchment in there

	it stood on a hill overlooking the village, some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over its face
	once a finelooking manor, and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the riddle house was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied
	the little hagletons all agreed that the old house was creepy
	half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce
	the story had been picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore
	every version of the tale, however, started in the same place  fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer's morning when the riddle house had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three riddles dead
	the maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could
	lying there with their eyes wide open  cold as ice  still in their dinner thingsthe police were summoned, and the whole of little hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and illdisguised excitement
	nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the riddles, for they had been most unpopular
	riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grownup son, tom, had been, if anything, worse
	all the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer  for plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night
	the hanged man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that night the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders
	they were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the riddles' cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called frank bryce had just  been arrested
	frank cried several people
	neverfrank bryce was the riddles' gardener
	he lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the riddle house
	frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the riddles ever since
	there was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details
	always thought he was odd, she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry
	i'm sure if i've offered him a cuppa once, i've offered it a hundred times
	never wanted to mix, he didn't
	ah, now, said a woman at the bar, he had a hard war, frank
	he likes the quiet life
	that's no reason to who else had a key to the back door, then barked the cook
	there's been a spare key hanging in the gardener's cottage far back as i can remember  nobody forced the door last night  no broken windows  all frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping
	the villagers exchanged dark looks
	i always thought that he had a nasty look about him, right enough, grunted a man at the bar
	war turned him funny, if you ask me, said the landlord
	told you i wouldn't like to get on the wrong side of frank, didn't i, dot said an excited woman in the corner
	horrible temper, said dot, nodding fervently
	i remember, when he was a kid
	by the following morning, hardly anyone in little hangleton doubted that frank bryce had killed the riddles
	but over in the neighboring town of great hangleton, in the dark and dingy police station, frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the riddles' deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, darkhaired and pale
	nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure frank had invented him
	then, just when things were looking very serious for frank, the report on the riddles' bodies came back and changed everything
	the police had never read an odder report
	a team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangles, suffocated, or as far as they could tell harmed at all
	in fact the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment, the riddles all appeared to be in perfet health  apart from the fact that they were all dead
	the doctors did note as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies that each of the riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face  but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being frightened to deathas there was no proof that the riddles had been murdered at all, the police were forced to let frank go
	the riddles were buried in the little hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while
	to everyone's surprise, and amid a cloud of suspicion, frank bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the riddle house
	's far as i'm concerned, he killed them, and i don't care what the police say, said dot in the hanged man
	and if he had any decency, he'd leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it
	but frank did not leave
	he stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the riddle house, and then the next  for neither family stayed long
	perhaps it was partly because of frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into disrepair
	the wealthy man who owned the riddle house these days neither lived there nor put it to any use they said in the village that he kept it for tax reasons, though nobody was very clear what these might be
	the wealthy owner continued to pay frank to do the gardening, however
	frank was nearing his seventyseventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them
	weeds were not the only things frank had to contend with either
	boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the riddle house
	they rode their bicycles over the lawns frank worked so hard to keep smooth
	once or twice, they broke into the old house for a dare
	they knew that old frank's devotion to the house and the grounds amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them
	frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their parents and grandparents, though him a murderer
	so when frank awoke one night in august and saw something very odd up at the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him
	it was frank's bad leg that woke him it was paining him worse than ever in his old age
	he got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hotwater bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee
	standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he looked up at the riddle house and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows
	frank knew at once what was going on
	the boys had broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering quality of the light, they had started a fire
	frank had no telephone, in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the riddles' deaths
	he put down the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door
	he picked up his walking stick, which was propped against the wall, and set off into the night
	the front door of the riddle house bore no sign of being forced, nor did any of the windows
	frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the door noiselessly
	he let himself into the cavernous kitchen
	frank had not entered it for many years nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his way towards it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead
	he reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick
	on the landing, frank turned right, and saw at once where the intruders were  at the every end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor
	frank edged closer and closer, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond
	the fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate
	then he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man's voice spoke within the room it sounded timid and fearful
	there is a little more in the bottle, my lord, if you are still hungry
	later, said a second voice
	this too belonged to a man  but it was strangely highpitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind
	something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of frank's neck stand up
	move me closer to the fire, wormtail
	frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear
	there came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor
	frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place
	he was wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head
	then he went out of sight again
	where is nagini said the cold voice
	i  i don't know, my lord, said the first voice nervously
	she set out to explore the house, i think
	you will milk her before we retire, wormtail, said the second voice
	i will need feeding in the night
	the journey has tired me greatly
	brow furrowed, frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door, listening very hard
	there was a pause, and then the man called wormtail spoke again
	my lord, may i ask how long we are going to stay herea week, said the cold voice
	the place is moderately comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet
	it would be foolish to act before the quidditch world cup is over
	frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it
	owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word quidditch, which was not a word at all
	the  the quidditch world cup, my lord said wormtail
	frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear
	forgive me, but  i do not understand  why should we wait until the world cup is overbecause, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the ministry of magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of ususual activity, checking and doublechecking identities
	they will be obsessed with security, lest the muggles notice anything
	frank stopped trying to clear out his ear
	he had distinctly heard the words ministry of magic, wizards, and muggles
	plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code  spies and criminals
	frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still
	your lordship is still determined, then  wormtail said quietly
	certainly i am determined, wormtail
	there was a note of menace in the cold voice now
	a slight pause followed  and the wormtail spoke, the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve
	it could be done without harry potter, my lord
	another pause, more protracted, and then without harry potter breathed the second voice softly
	my lord, i do not say this out of concern for the boy  said wormtail, his voice rising squeakily
	the boy is nothing to me, nothing at all  it is merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard  any wizard  the thing could be done so much more quickly  if you allowed me to leave you for a short while  you know that i can disguise myself most effectively  i could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person i could use another wizard, said the cold voice softly, that is true
	my lord, it makes sense, said wormtail, sounding thoroughly relieved now
	laying hands on harry potter would be so difficult, he is so well protected and so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute  i wonder
	perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you, wormtail  could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert memy lord  i  i have no wish to leave you, none at all do not lie to me  hissed the second voice
	i can always tell, wormtail  you are regretting that you ever returned to me
	i see you flinch when you look at me, feel you shudder when you touch me
	no  my devotion to your lordship your devotion is nothing more than cowardice
	you would not be here if you had anywhere else to go
	how am i to survive without you, when i need feeding every few hours  who is to milk naginibut you seem so much stronger, my lord liar, breathed the second voice
	i am no stronger, and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health i have regained under your clumsy care
	silencewormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell silent at once
	for a few seconds, frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling
	the the second man spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss
	i have my reasons for using the boy, as i have already explained to you, and i will use no other
	i have waited thirteen years
	a few more months will make no difference
	as for the protection surrounding the boy, i believe my plan will be effective
	all that is needed is a little courage from you, wormtail  courage you will find, unless you wish to feel the full extent of lord voldermort's wrath my lord, i must speak  said wormtail, panic in his voice now
	all through our journey i have gone over the plan in my head  my lord, bertha jorkin's disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if we proceed, if i murder if  whispered the second voice
	if  if you follow the plan, wormtail, the ministry need never know that anyone else has died
	you will do it quietly and without fuss i only wish that i could do it myself, but in my present condition
	come, wormtail, one more death and our path to harry potter is clear
	i am not asking you to do it alone
	by that time, my faithful serant will have rejoined us i am a faithful servant,  said wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness in his voice
	wormtail, i need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement
	i found you, said wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now
	i was the one who found you
	i brought you bertha jorkins
	that is true, said the second man, sounding amused
	a stroke of brilliance i would not have thought possible from you, wormtail  though, if truth be told, you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her, were youi  i thought she might be useful, my lord liar, said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever
	however, i do not deny that her information was invaluable
	without it, i could never have formed our plan, and for that, you will have your reward, wormtail
	i will allow you to perform an essential task for me, one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform
	rreally, my lord  what    wormtail sounded terrified again
	ah, wormtail, you don't want me to spoil the surprise  your part will come at the very end
	but i promise you, you will have the honor of being just as useful as bertha jorkins
	wormtail's voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as though his mouth had gone very dry
	to kill me toowormtail, wormtail, said the cold voice silkily, why would i kill you  i killed bertha because i had to
	she was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite useless
	in any case, awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays
	wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into ministry of magic witches at wayside inns
	wormtail muttered something so quietly that frank could not hear it, but it made the second man laugh  an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech
	we could have modified her memory  but memory charms can be broken by a powerful wizard, as i proved when i questioned her
	it would be an insult to her memory not to use the information i extracted from her, wormtail
	out in the corridor, frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat
	the man with the cold voice had killed a woman
	he was talking about it without any kind of remorse  with amusement
	he was dangerous  a madman
	and he was planning more murders  this boy, harry potter, whoever he was  was in danger frank knew what he must do
	now, if ever, was the time to go to the police
	he would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village
	but the cold voice was speaking again, and frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might
	my faithful servant at hogwarts
	harry potter is as good as mine, wormtail
	there will be no more argument
	i think i hear nagini
	and the second man's voice changed
	he started making noises such as frank had never heard before he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath
	frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure
	and then frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway
	he turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with fright
	something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long
	horrified, transfixed, frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide, curving track through the thick dust on the floor, coming closer and closer  what was he to do  the only means of escape was into the room where the two men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him but before he had made his decision, the snake was level with him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing it was following the spitting, hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in seconds, the tip of its diamondpatterned tail had vanished through the gap
	there was sweat on frank's forehead now, and the hand on the walking stick was trembling
	inside the room, the cold voice was continuing to hiss, and frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible idea
	this man could talk to snakes
	frank didn't understand what was going on
	he wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with his hotwater bottle
	the problem was that his legs didn't seem to want to move
	as he stood there shaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice switched abruptly to english again
	nagini has interesting news, wormtail, it said
	inindeed, my lord  said wormtail
	indeed, yes, said the voice, according to nagini, there is an old muggle standing right outside this room, listening to every word we say
	frank didn't have a chance to hide himself
	there were footsteps and then the door of the room was flung wide open
	a short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed nose, and small, watery eyes stood before frank, a mixture of fear and alarm in his face
	invite him inside, wormtail
	where are your mannersthe cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire, but frank couldn't see the speaker
	the snake, on the other hand, was curled up on the rotting hearth rug, like some horrible travesty of a pet dog
	wormtail beckoned frank into the room
	though still deeply shaken, frank took a firmer grip on his walking stick and limped over the threshold
	the fire was the only source of light in the room it cast long, spidery shadows upon the walls
	frank stared at the back of the armchair the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for frank couldn't even see the back of his head
	you heard everything, muggle  said the cold voice
	what's that you're calling me  said frank defiantly, for now that he was inside the room, now that the time had come for some sort of action, he felt braver it had always been so in the war
	i am calling you a muggle, said the voice coolly
	it means that you are not a wizard
	i don't know what you mean by wizard, said frank, his voice growing steadier
	all i know is i've heard enough to interest the police tonight, i have
	you've done murder and you're planning more  and i'll tell youthis too, he added, on a sudden inspiration, my wife knows i'm up here, and if i don't come back you have no wife, said te cold voice, very quietly
	nobody knows you are here
	you told nobody that you were coming
	do not lie to lord voldemort, muggle, for he knows
	is that right  said frank roughly
	lord, is it  well, i don't think much of your manners, my lord
	turn 'round and face me like a man, why don't youbut i am not a man, muggle, said the cold voice, barely audible now over the crackling of the flames
	i am much, much more than a man
	why not  i will face you
	wormtail, come turn my chair around
	the servant gave a whimper
	you heard me, wormtail
	slowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay, the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair
	the snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug
	and then the chair was facing frank, and he saw what was sitting in it
	his walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter
	he opened his mouth and let out a scream
	he was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand
	there was a flash of green light, a rushing sound, and frank bryce crumpled
	he was dead before he hit the floor
	two hundred miles away, the boy called harry potter woke with a start
	chapter two  the scarharry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been running
	he had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face
	the old scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of lightning, was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a whitehot wire to his skin
	he sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other hand reaching out in the darkness for his glasses, which were on the bedside table
	he put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window
	harry ran his fingers over the scar again
	it was still painful
	he turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the room, opened his wardrobe, and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door
	a skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair
	he examined the lightningbolt scar of his reflection more closely
	it looked normal, but it was still stinging
	harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken
	it had seemed so real
	there had been two people he knew and one he didn't
	he concentrated hard, frowning, trying to remember
	the dim picture of a darkened room came to him
	there had been a snake on a hearth rug
	a small man called peter, nicknamed wormtail
	and a cold, high voice
	the voice of lord voldemort
	harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought
	he closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what voldemort had looked like, but it was impossible
	all harry knew was that at the moment when voldemort's chair had swung around, and he, harry, had seen what was sitting in it, he had felt a spasm of horror, which had awoken him
	or had that been the pain in his scarand who had the old man been  for there had definitely been an old man harry had watched him fall to the ground
	it was all becoming confused
	harry put his face into his hands, blocking out his bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them
	voldemort and wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed, though harry could not remember the name
	and they had been plotting to kill someone else
	himharry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes, and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there
	as it happened, there was an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room
	a large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron, broomstick, black robes, and assorted spellbooks
	rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which his snowy owl, hedwig, usually perched
	on the floor beside his bed a book lay open harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night
	the pictures in this book were all moving
	men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks, throwing a red ball to one another
	harry walked over to the book, picked it up, and watched on of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fiftyfoothigh hoop
	then he snapped the book shut
	even quidditch  in harry's opinion, the best sport in the world  couldn't distract him at the moment
	he placed flying with the cannons on his bedside table, crossed to the window, and drew back the curtains to survey the street below
	privet drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look inthe early hours of saturday morning
	all the curtains were closed
	as far as harry could see through the darkness, there wasn't a living creature in sight, not even a cat
	harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it, running a finger over his scar again
	it wasn't the pain that bothered him harry was no stranger to pain and injury
	he had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night
	the same arm had been pierced by a venemous footlong fang not long afterward
	only last year harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborn broomstick
	he was used to bizarre accidents and injuries they were unavoidable if you attended hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble
	no, the thing that was bothering harry was the last time his scar had hurt him, it had been because voldemort had been close by
	but voldemort couldn't be here, now
	the idea of voldemort lurking in privet drive was absurd, impossible
	harry listened closely to the silence around him
	was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak  and then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room
	harry shook himself mentally he was being stupid
	there was no one in the house with him except uncle vernon, aunt petunia, and dudley, and they were plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and painless
	asleep was the way harry liked the dursleys best it wasn't as though they were ever any help to him awake
	uncle vernon, aunt petunia, and dudley were harry's only living relatives
	they were muggles who hated and despised magic in any form, which meant that harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot
	they had explained away harry's long absences at hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to st
	brutus's secure center for incurably criminal boys
	they knew perfectly well that, as an underage wizard, harry wasn't allowed to use magic outside hogwarts, but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house
	harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world
	the very idea of going to them when they awoke, and telling them about his scar hurting him, and about his worries about voldemort, was laughable
	and yet it was because of voldemort that harry had come to live with the dursleys in the first place
	if it hadn't been for voldemort, harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead
	if it hadn't been for voldemort, harry would still have had parents
	harry had been a year old the night that voldemort  the most powerful dark wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years  arrived at his house and killed his father and mother
	voldemort had then turned his wand on harry he had performed the curse that had disposed of many fullgrown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power  and, incredibly, it had not worked
	instead of killing the small boy, the curse had rebounded upon voldemort
	harry had survived with nothing but a lightningshaped cut on his forehead, and voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive
	his powers gone, his life almost extinguished, voldemort had fled the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted, voldemort's followers had disbanded, and harry potter had become famous
	it had been enough of a shock for harry to discover, on his eleventh birthday, that he was a wizard it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name
	harry had arrived at hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went
	but he was used to it now  at the end of this summer, he would be starting his fourth year at hogwarts, and harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again
	but there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school
	he looked hopelessly around his room again, and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of july
	what would they say if harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurtingat once, hermione granger's voice seemed to fill his head, shrill and panicky
	your scar hurt  harry, that's really serious
	write to professor dumbledore and i'll go and check common magical ailments and afflictions
	maybe there's something in there about curse scars
	yes, that would be hermione's advice  go straight to the headmaster of hogwarts, and in the meantime, consult a book
	harry stared out of the window at the inky blueblack sky
	he doubted very much whether a book could help him now
	as far as he knew, he was the only living person to have survived a curse like voldemort's it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he would find his symptoms listed in common magical ailments and afflictions
	as for informing the headmaster, harry had no idea where dumbledore went during the summer holidays
	he amused himself for a moment, picturing dumbledore, with his long silver beard, full length wizard's robes, and pointed hat, stretched out on a beach somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose
	wherever dumbledore was, though, harry was sure that hedwig would be able to find him harry's owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone, even without an address
	but what would he writedear professor dumbledore, sorry to bother you, but my scar hurt this morning
	yours sincerely, harry potter
	even inside his head the words sounded stupid
	and so he tried to imagine his other best friend, ron weasley's, reaction, and in a moment, ron's red hair and longnosed, freckled face seemed to swim before harry, wearing a bemused expression
	but youknowwho can't be near you now, can he i mean
	you'd know, wouldn't you he'd be trying to do you in again, wouldn't be i dunno, harry, maybe curse scars always twinge a bit
	weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic, but he didn't have any particular expertise in the matter of curses, as far as harry knew
	in any case, harry didn't like the idea of the whole weasley family knowing that he, harry, was getting jumpy about a few moments' pain
	weasley would fuss worse than hermione, and fred and george, ron's sixteen yearold twin brothers, might think harry was losing his nerve
	the weasleys were harry's favorite family in the world he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now ron had mentioned something about the quidditch world cup, and he somehow didn't want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar
	harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles
	what he really wanted and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself was someone like  someone like a parent an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid, someone who cared about him, who had had experience with dark magic
	and then the solution came to him
	it was so simple, and so obvious, that he couldn't believe it had taken so long  sirius
	harry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat down at his desk he pulled a piece of parchment toward him, loaded his eaglefeather quill with ink, wrote dear sirius, then paused, wondering how best to phrase his problem, still marveling at the fact that he hadn't thought of sirius straight away
	but then, perhaps it wasn't so surprising  after all, he had only found out that sirius was his godfather two months ago
	there was a simple reason for sirius's complete absence from harry's life until then  sirius had been in azkaban, the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors, sightless, soulsucking fiends who had come to search for sirius at hogwarts when he had escaped
	yet sirius had been innocent  the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by wormtail, voldemort's supporter, whom nearly everybody now believed dead
	harry, ron, and hermione knew otherwise, however they had come facetoface with wormtail only the previous year, though only professor dumbledore had believed their story
	for one glorious hour, harry had believed that he was leaving the dursleys at last, because sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared
	but the chance had been snatched away from him  wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the ministry of magic, and sirius had had to flee for his life
	harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called buckbeak, and since then, sirius had been on the run
	the home harry might have had if wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer
	it had been doubly hard to return to the dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever
	nevertheless, sirius had been of some help to harry, even if he couldn't be with him
	it was due to sirius that harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him
	the dursleys had never allowed this before their general wish of keeping harry as miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of his powers, had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this
	but their attitude had changed since they had found out that harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather  for harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that sirius was innocent
	harry had received two letters from sirius since he had been back at privet drive
	both had been delivered, not by owls as was usual with wizards, but by large, brightly colored tropical birds
	hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again
	harry, on the other hand, had liked them they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand, and he hoped that, wherever sirius was sirius never said, in case the letters were intercepted, he was enjoying himself
	somehow, harry found it hard to imaging dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight, perhapse that was why sirius had gone south
	sirius's letters, which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboards under harry's bed, sounded chearful, and in both of them he had reminded harry to call on him if ever harry needed to
	well, he needed to right now, all right
	harry's lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room
	finally, when the sun had risen, when his bedroom walls had turned gold, and when sounds of movement could be heard from uncle vernon and aunt petunia's room, harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter
	dear sirius,thanks for your last letter
	that bird was enormous it could hardly get through my window
	things are the same as usual here
	dudley's diet isn't going too well
	my aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday
	they told him they'd have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it, so he got really angry and chucked his playstation out of the window
	that's a sort of computer thing you can play games on
	bit stupid really, now he hasn't even got megamutilation part three to take his mind off things
	i'm okay, mainly because the dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if i ask you to
	a weird thing happened this morning, though
	last time that happened it was because voldemort was at hogwarts
	but i don't reckon he can be anywhere near me now, can he do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterwardi'll send this with hedwig when she gets back she's off hunting at the moment
	say hello to buckbeak for me
	harryyes, thought harry, that looked all right
	there was no point putting in the dream he didn't want it to look as though he was too worried
	he folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk, ready for when hedwig returned
	then he got to his feet, stretched, and opened his wardrobe once more
	without glancing at his reflection he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast
	chapter three  the invitation             by the time harry arrived in the kitchen, the three dursleys were already seated around the table
	none of them looked up as he entered or sat down
	uncle vernon's large red face was hidden behind the morning's daily mail, and aunt petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed over her horselike teeth
	dudley looked furious and sulky, and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual
	this was saying something, as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself
	when aunt petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto dudley's plate with a tremulous there you are, diddy darling, dudley glowered at her
	his life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his endofyear report
	uncle vernon and aunt petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual  aunt petunia always insisted that dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn't understand him, while uncle vernon maintained that he didn't want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway
	they also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report  he's a boisterous little boy, but he wouldn't hurt a fly aunt petunia had said tearfully
	however, at the bottom of the report there were a few wellchosen comments from the school nurse that not even uncle vernon and aunt petunia could explain away
	no matter how much aunt petunia wailed that dudley was bigboned, and that his poundage was really puppy fat, and that he was a growing boy who needed plenty of food, the fact remained that the school outfitters didn't stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore
	the school nurse had seen what aunt petunia's eyes  so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors  simply refused to see  that far from needing extra nourishment, dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale
	so  after many tantrums, after arguments that shook harry's bedroom floor, and many tears from aunt petunia  the new regime had begun
	the diet sheet that had been sent by the smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been emptied of all dudley's favorite things  fizzy drinks and cakes, chocolate bars and burgers and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that uncle vernon called rabbit food
	to make dudley feel better about it all, aunt petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too
	she now passed a grapefruit quarter to harry
	he noticed that it was a lot smaller than dudley's
	aunt petunia seemed to feet that the best way to keep up dudley's morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get more to eat than harry
	but aunt petunia didn't know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs
	she had no idea that harry was not following the diet at all
	the moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks, harry had sent hedwig to his friends with pleas for help, and they had risen to the occasion magnificently
	hedwig had returned from hermione's house with a large box stuffed full of sugarfree snacks
	hermione's parents were dentists
	hagrid, the hogwarts gamekeeper, had obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes
	harry hadn't touched these he had had too much experience of hagrid's cooking
	weasley, however, had sent the family owl, errol, with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies
	poor errol, who was elderly and feeble, had needed a full five days to recover from the journey
	and then on harry's birthday which the dursleys had completely ignored he had received four superb birthday cakes, one each from ron, hermione, hagrid, and sirius
	harry still had two of them left, and so, looking forward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs, he ate his grapefruit without complaint
	uncle vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter
	is this it he said grumpily to aunt petunia
	aunt petunia gave him a severe look, and then nodded pointedly at dudley, who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing harry's with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes
	uncle vernon gave a great sigh, which ruffled his large, bushy mustache, and picked up his spoon
	uncle vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off down the hall
	quick as a flash, while his mother was occupied with the kettle, dudley stole the rest of uncle vernon's grapefruit
	harry heard talking at the door, and someone laughing, and uncle vernon answering curtly
	then the front door closed, and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall
	aunt petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where uncle vernon had got to
	she didn't have to wait long to find out after about a minute, he was back
	you, he barked at harry
	bewildered, wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time, harry got up and followed uncle vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room
	uncle vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them
	so, he said, marching over to the fireplace and turning to face harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest
	harry would have dearly loved to have said, so what but he didn't feel that uncle vernon's temper should be tested this early in the morning, especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food
	he therefore settled for looking politely puzzled
	this just arrived, said uncle vernon
	he brandished a piece of purple writing paper at harry
	harry's confusion increased
	who would be writing to uncle vernon about him  who did he know who sent letters by the postmanuncle vernon glared at harry, then looked down at the letter and began to read alouddear mr
	dursley,we have never been introduced, but i am sure you have heard a great deal from harry about my son ron
	as harry might have told you, the final of the quidditch world cup takes place this monday night, and my husband, arthur, has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the department of magical games and sports
	i do hope you will allow us to take harry to the match, as this really is a onceinalifetime opportunity britain hasn't hosted the cup for thirty years, and tickets are extremely hard to come by
	we would of course be glad to have harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays, and to see him safely onto the train back to school
	it would be best for harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way, because the muggle postman has never delivered to our house, and i am not sure he even knows where it is
	hoping to see harry soon,yours sincerely,molly weasleyp
	i do hope we've put enough stamps on
	uncle vernon finished reading, put his hand back into his breast pocket, and drew out something else
	look at this, he growled
	he held up the envelope in which mrs
	weasley's letter had come, and harry had to fight down a laugh
	every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front, into which mrs
	weasley had squeezed the dursleys' address in minute writing
	she did put enough stamps on, then, said harry, trying to sound as though mrs
	weasley's was a mistake anyone could make
	his uncle's eyes flashed
	the postman noticed, he said through gritted teeth
	very interested to know where this letter came from, he was
	that's why he rang the doorbell
	seemed to think it was funny
	harry didn't say anything
	other people might not understand why uncle vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps, but harry had lived with the dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary
	their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected however distantly with people like mrs
	uncle vernon was still glaring at harry, who tried to keep his expression neutral
	if he didn't do or say anything stupid, he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime
	he waited for uncle vernon to say something, but he merely continued to glare
	harry decided to break the silence
	so  can i go then he asked
	a slight spasm crossed uncle vernon's large purple face
	the mustache bristled
	harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache a furious battle as two of uncle vernon's most fundamental instincts came into conflict
	allowing harry to go would make harry happy, something uncle vernon had struggled against for thirteen years
	on the other hand, allowing harry to disappear to the weasleys' for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and uncle vernon hated having harry in the house
	to give himself thinking time, it seemed, he looked down at mrs
	weasley's letter again
	who is this woman he said, staring at the signature with distaste
	you've seen her, said harry
	she's my friend ron's mother, she was meeting him off the hog  off the school train at the end of last term
	he had almost said hogwarts express, and that was a sure way to get his uncle's temper up
	nobody ever mentioned the name of harry's school aloud in the dursley household
	uncle vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasant
	dumpy sort of woman he growled finally
	load of children with red hairharry frowned
	he thought it was a bit rich of uncle vernon to call anyone dumpy, when his own son, dudley, had finally achieved what he'd been threatening to do since the age of three, and become wider than he was tall
	uncle vernon was perusing the letter again
	quidditch, he muttered under his breath
	quidditch  what is this rubbishharry felt a second stab of annoyance
	it's a sport, he said shortly
	played on broom all right, all right  said uncle vernon loudly
	harry saw, with some satisfaction, that his uncle looked vaguely panicky
	apparently his nerves couldn't stand the sound of the word broomsticks in his living room
	he took refuge in perusing the letter again
	harry saw his lips form the words send us your answer
	what does she mean, 'the normal way'  he spat
	normal for us, said harry, and before his uncle could stop him, he added, you know, owl post
	that's what's normal for wizards
	uncle vernon looked as outraged as if harry had just uttered a disgusting swearword
	shaking with anger, he shot a nervous look through the window, as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass
	how many times do i have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof  he hissed, his face now a rich plum color
	you stand there, in the clothes petunia and i have put on your ungrateful back only after dudley finished with them, said harry coldly, and indeed, he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands, and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans
	i will not be spoken to like that  said uncle vernon, trembling with rage
	but harry wasn't going to stand for this
	gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the dursleys' stupid rules
	he wasn't following dudley's diet, and he wasn't going to let uncle vernon stop him from going to the quidditch world cup, not if he could help it
	harry took a deep, steadying breath and then said, okay, i can't see the world cup
	can i go now, then  only i've got a letter to sirius i want to finish
	you know  my godfather
	he had done it, he had said the magic words
	now he watched the purple recede blotchily from uncle vernon's face, making it look like badly mixed black currant ice cream
	you're  you're writing to him, are you  said uncle vernon, in a wouldbe calm voice  but harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear
	well  yeah, said harry, casually
	it's been a while since he heard from me, and, you know, if he doesn't he might start thinking something's wrong
	he stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words
	he could almost see the cogs working under uncle vernon's thick, dark, neatly parted hair
	if he tried to stop harry writing to sirius, sirius would think harry was being mistreated
	if he told harry he couldn't go to the quidditch world cup, harry would write and tell sirius, who would know harry was being mistreated
	there was only one thing for uncle vernon to do
	harry could see the conclusion forming in his uncle's mind as though the great mustached face were transparent
	harry tried not to smile, to keep his own face as blank as possible
	and then well, all right then
	you can go to this ruddy
	this world cup thing
	you write and tell these  these weasleys they're to pick you up, mind
	i haven't got time to go dropping you off all over the country
	and you can spend the rest of the summer there
	and you can tell your  your godfather
	tell him you're going
	okay then, said harry brightly
	he turned and walked toward the living room door, fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop
	he was going to the weasleys', he was going to watch the quidditch world cupoutside in the hall he nearly ran into dudley, who had been lurking behind the door, clearly hoping to overhear harry being told off
	he looked shocked to see the broad grin on harry's face
	that was an excellent breakfast, wasn't it said harry
	i feel really full, don't youlaughing at the astonished look on dudley's face, harry took the stairs three at a time, and hurled himself back into his bedroom
	the first thing he saw was that hedwig was back
	she was sitting in her cage, staring at harry with her enormous amber eyes, and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something
	exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost at once
	ouch said harry as what appeared to be a small, gray, feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head
	harry massaged the spot furiously, looking up to see what had hit him, and saw a minute owl, small enough to fit into the palm of his hand, whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework
	harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet
	harry bent down, recognized ron's handwriting, then tore open the envelope
	inside was a hastily scribbled note
	harry  dad got the tickets  ireland versus bulgaria, monday night
	mum's writing to the muggles to ask you to stay
	they might already have the letter, i don't know how fast muggle post is
	thought i'd send this with pig anyway
	harry stared at the word pig, then looked up at the tiny owl now zooming around the light fixture on the ceiling
	he had never seen anything that looked less like a pig
	maybe he couldn't read ron's writing
	he went back to the letterwe're coming for you whether the muggles like it or not, you can't miss the world cup, only mum and dad reckon it's better if we pretend to ask their permission first
	if they say yes, send pig back with your answer pronto, and we'll come and get you at five o'clock on sunday
	if they say no, send pig back pronto and we'll come and get you at five o'clock on sunday anyway
	hermione's arriving this afternoon
	percy's started work  the department of international magical cooperation
	don't mention anything about abroad while you're here unless you want the pants bored off you
	see you soon  roncalm down harry said as the small owl flew low over his head, twittering madly with what harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person
	come here, i need you to take my answer backthe owl fluttered down on top of hedwig's cage
	hedwig looked coldly up at it, as though daring it to try and come any closer
	harry seized his eaglefeather quill once more, grabbed a fresh piece of parchment, and wroteron, it's all okay, the muggles say i can come
	see you five o'clock tomorrow
	harryhe folded this note up very small, and with immense difficulty, tied it to the tiny owl's leg as it hopped on the spot with excitement
	the moment the note was secure, the owl was off again it zoomed out of the window and out of sight
	harry turned to hedwig
	feeling up to a long journey he asked her
	hedwig hooted in a dignified sort of a way
	can you take this to sirius for me he said, picking up his letter
	i just want to finish it
	he unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript
	if you want to contact me, i'll be at my friend ron weasley's for the rest of the summer
	his dad's got us tickets for the quidditch world cupthe letter finished, he tied it to hedwig's leg she kept unusually still, as though determined to show him how a real post owl should behave
	i'll be at ron's when you get back, all right harry told her
	she nipped his finger affectionately, then, with a soft swooshing noise, spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open window
	harry watched her out of sight, then crawled under his bed, wrenched up the loose floorboard, and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake
	he sat there on the floor eating it, savoring the happiness that was flooding through him
	he had cake, and dudley had nothing but grapefruit it was a bright summer's day, he would be leaving privet drive tomorrow, his scar felt perfectly normal again, and he was going to watch the quidditch world cup
	it was hard, just now, to feel worried about anything  even lord voldemort
	chapter four  back to the burrowby twelve o'clock the next day, harry's school trunk was packed with his school things and all his most prized possessions  the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father, the broomstick he had gotten from sirius, the enchanted map of hogwarts he had been given by fred and george weasley last year
	he had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food, doublechecked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills, and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the days to september the first, on which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to hogwarts
	the atmosphere inside number four, privet drive was extremely tense
	the imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards was making the dursleys uptight and irritable
	uncle vernon had looked downright alarmed when harry informed him that the weasleys would be arriving at five o'clock the very next day
	i hope you told them to dress properly, these people, he snarled at once
	i've seen the sort of stuff your lot wear
	they'd better have the decency to put on normal clothes, that's all
	harry felt a slight sense of foreboding
	he had rarely seen mr
	weasley wearing anything that the dursleys would call normal
	their children might don muggle clothing during the holidays, but mr
	weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness
	harry wasn't bothered about what the neighbors would think, but he was anxious about how rude the dursleys might be to the weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards
	uncle vernon had put on his best suit
	to some people, this might have looked like a gesture of welcome, but harry knew it was because uncle vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating
	dudley, on the other hand, looked somehow diminished
	this was not because the diet was at last taking effect, but due to fright
	dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly pig's tail poking out of the seat of his trousers, and aunt petunia and uncle vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in london
	it wasn't altogether surprising, therefore, that dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside, and walking sideways from room to room, so as not to present the same target to the enemy
	lunch was an almost silent meal
	dudley didn't even protest at the food cottage cheese and grated celery
	aunt petunia wasn't, eating anything at all
	her arms were folded, her lips were pursed, and she seemed to be chewing her tongue, as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at harry
	they'll be driving, of course uncle vernon barked across the table
	he hadn't thought of that
	how were the weasleys going to pick him up  they didn't have a car anymore the old ford anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in the forbidden forest at hogwarts
	weasley had borrowed a ministry of magic car last year possibly he would do the same todayi think so, said harry
	uncle vernon snorted into his mustache
	normally, uncle vernon would have asked what car mr
	weasley drove he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were
	but harry doubted whether uncle vernon would have taken to mr
	weasley even if he drove a ferrari
	harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom he couldn't stand watching aunt petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds, as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros
	finally, at a quarter to five, harry went back downstairs and into the living room
	aunt petunia was compulsively straightening cushions
	uncle vernon was pretending to read the paper, but his tiny eyes were not moving, and harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car
	dudley was crammed into an armchair, his porky hands beneath him, clamped firmly around his bottom
	harry couldn't take the tension he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on his watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves
	but five o'clock came and then went
	uncle vernon, perspiring slightly in his suit, opened the front door, peered up and down the street, then withdrew his head quickly
	they're late he snarled at harry
	maybe  er  the traffic's bad, or something
	then a quarter past five
	harry was starting to feel anxious himself now
	at half past, he heard uncle vernon and aunt petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living room
	no consideration at all
	we might've had an engagement
	maybe they think they'll get invited to dinner if they're late
	well, they most certainly won't be, said uncle vernon, and harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room
	they'll take the boy and go, there'll be no hanging around
	that's if they're coming at all
	probably mistaken the day
	i daresay their kind don't set much store by punctuality
	either that or they drive some tinpot car that's broken d aaaaaaaarrrrrghharry jumped up
	from the other side of the living room door came the sounds of the three dursleys scrambling, panicstricken, across the room
	next moment dudley came flying into the hall, looking terrified
	what happened said harry
	what's the matterbut dudley didn't seem able to speak
	hands still clamped over his buttocks, he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen
	harry hurried into the living room
	loud bangings and scrapings were coming from behind the dursleys' boardedup fireplace, which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of it
	what is it gasped aunt petunia, who had backed into the wall and was staring, terrified, toward the fire
	what is it, vernonbut they were left in doubt barely a second longer
	voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplace
	ouch fred, no  go back, go back, there's been some kind of mistake  tell george not to  ouch george, no, there's no room, go back quickly and tell ronmaybe harry can hear us, dad  maybe he'll be able to let us outthere was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the electric fire
	harry harry, can you hear usthe dursleys rounded on harry like a pair of angry wolverines
	what is this growled uncle vernon
	what's going onthey  they've tried to get here by floo powder, said harry, fighting a mad desire to laugh
	they can travel by fire  only you've blocked the fireplace  hang on he approached the fireplace and called through the boards
	weasley  can you hear methe hammering stopped
	somebody inside the chimney piece said, shhmr
	weasley, it's harry
	the fireplace has been blocked up
	you won't be able to get through there
	what on earth did they want to block up the fireplace forthey've got an electric fire, harry explained
	weasley's voice excitedly
	eclectic, you say  with a plug gracious, i must see that
	ouch, ronron's voice now joined the others'
	what are we doing here  has something gone wrongoh no, ron, came fred's voice, very sarcastically
	no, this is exactly where we wanted to end up
	yeah, we're having the time of our lives here, said george, whose voice sounded muffled, as though he was squashed against the wall
	i'm trying to think what to do
	harry retreated to the sofa
	uncle vernon, however, moved forward
	wait a moment he bellowed at the fire
	what exactly are you going to bang
	the electric fire shot across the room as the boardedup fireplace burst outward, expelling mr
	weasley, fred, george, and ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings
	aunt petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table uncle vernon caught her before she hit the floor, and gaped, speechless, at the weasleys, all of whom had bright red hair, including fred and george, who were identical to the last freckle
	that's better, panted mr
	weasley, brushing dust from his long green robes and straightening his glasses
	ah  you must be harry's aunt and uncletall, thin, and balding, he moved toward uncle vernon, his hand outstretched, but uncle vernon backed away several paces, dragging aunt petunia
	words utterly failed uncle vernon
	his best suit was covered in white dust, which had settled in his hair and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty years
	er  yes  sorry about that, said mr
	weasley, lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace
	it just didn't occur to me that we wouldn't be able to get out at the other end
	i had your fireplace connected to the floo network, you see  just for an afternoon, you know, so we could get harry
	muggle fireplaces aren't supposed to be connected, strictly speaking  but i've got a useful contact at the floo regulation panel and he fixed it for me
	i can put it right in a jiffy, though, don't worry
	i'll light a fire to send the boys back, and then i can repair your fireplace before i disapparate
	harry was ready to bet that the dursleys hadn't understood a single word of this
	they were still gaping at mr
	weasley, thunderstruck
	aunt petunia staggered upright again and hid behind uncle vernon
	got your trunk readyit's upstairs, said harry, grinning back
	we'll get it, said fred at once
	winking at harry, he and george left the room
	they knew where harry's bedroom was, having once rescued him from it in the dead of night
	harry suspected that fred and george were hoping for a glimpse of dudley they had heard a lot about him from harry
	weasley, swinging his arms slightly, while he tried to find words to break the very nasty silence
	very  erm  very nice place you've got here
	as the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of brick, this remark didn't go down too well with the dursleys
	uncle vernon's face purpled once more, and aunt petunia started chewing her tongue again
	however, they seemed too scared to actually say anything
	weasley was looking around
	he loved everything to do with muggles
	harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder
	they run off eckeltricity, do they he said knowledgeably
	ah yes, i can see the plugs
	i collect plugs, he added to uncle vernon
	got a very large collection of batteries
	my wife thinks i'm mad, but there you are
	uncle vernon clearly thought mr
	he moved ever so slightly to the right, screening aunt petunia from view, as though he thought mr
	weasley might suddenly run at them and attack
	dudley suddenly reappeared in the room
	harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had scared dudley out of the kitchen
	dudley edged along the wall, gazing at mr
	weasley with terrified eyes, and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father
	unfortunately, uncle vernon's bulk, while sufficient to hide bony aunt petunia, was nowhere near enough to conceal dudley
	ah, this is your cousin, is it, harry said mr
	weasley, taking another brave stab at making conversation
	yep, said harry, that's dudley
	he and ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming
	dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off
	weasley, however, seemed genuinely concerned at dudley's peculiar behavior
	indeed, from the tone of his voice when he next spoke, harry was quite sure that mr
	weasley thought dudley was quite as mad as the dursleys thought he was, except that mr
	weasley felt sympathy rather than fear
	having a good holiday, dudley he said kindly
	harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his massive backside
	fred and george came back into the room carrying harry's school trunk
	they glanced around as they entered and spotted dudley
	their faces cracked into identical evil grins
	better get cracking then
	he pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand
	harry saw the dursleys draw back against the wall as one
	weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him
	flames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours
	weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket, untied it, took a pinch of the powder inside, and threw it onto the flames, which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever
	off you go then, fred, said mr
	oh no  hang on a bag of sweets had spilled out of fred's pocket and the contents were now rolling in every direction  big, fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers
	fred scrambled around, cramming them back into his pocket, then gave the dursleys a cheery wave, stepped forward, and walked right into the fire, saying the burrow  aunt petunia gave a little shuddering gasp
	there was a whooshing sound, and fred vanished
	right then, george, said mr
	weasley, you and the trunk
	harry helped george carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better
	then, with a second whoosh, george had cried the burrow and vanished too
	ron, you next, said mr
	see you, said ron brightly to the dursleys
	he grinned broadly at harry, then stepped into the fire, shouted the burrow and disappeared
	weasley alone remained
	'bye then, harry said to the dursleys
	they didn't say anything at all
	harry moved toward the fire, but just as he reached the edge of the hearth, mr
	weasley put out a hand and held him back
	he was looking at the dursleys in amazement
	harry said goodbye to you, he said
	didn't you hear himit doesn't matter, harry muttered to mr
	honestly, i don't care
	weasley did not remove his hand from harry's shoulder
	you aren't going to see your nephew till next summer, he said to uncle vernon in mild indignation
	surely you're going to say goodbyeuncle vernon's face worked furiously
	the idea of being taught consideration by a man who had just blasted away half his living room wall seemed to be causing him intense suffering
	weasley's wand was still in his hand, and uncle vernon's tiny eyes darted to it once, before he said, very resentfully, goodbye, then
	see you, said harry, putting one foot forward into the green flames, which felt pleasantly like warm breath
	at that moment, however, a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him, and aunt petunia started to scream
	dudley was no longer standing behind his parents
	he was kneeling beside the coffee table, and he was gagging and sputtering on a footlong, purple, slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth
	one bewildered second later, harry realized that the footlong thing was dudley's tongue  and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him
	aunt petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside dudley, seized the end of his swollen tongue, and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth unsurprisingly, dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever, trying to fight her off
	uncle vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around, and mr
	weasley had to shout to make himself heard
	not to worry, i can sort him out  he yelled, advancing on dudley with his wand outstretched, but aunt petunia screamed worse than ever and threw herself on top of dudley, shielding him from mr
	it's a simple process it was the toffee  my son fred  real practical joker  but it's only an engorgement charm  at least, i think it is  please, i can correct it but far from being reassured, the dursleys became more panic stricken aunt petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging dudley's tongue as though determined to rip it out dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue and uncle vernon, who had lost control completely, seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at mr
	weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace
	weasley angrily, brandishing his wand
	i'm trying to helpbellowing like a wounded hippo, uncle vernon snatched up another ornament
	harry, go just go  mr
	weasley shouted, his wand on uncle vernon
	i'll sort this outharry didn't want to miss the fun, but uncle vernon's second ornament narrowly missed his left ear, and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to mr
	he stepped into the fire, looking over his shoulder as he said the burrow  his last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of mr
	weasley blasting a third ornament out of uncle vernon's hand with his wand, aunt petunia screaming and lying on top of dudley, and dudley's tongue lolling around like a great slimy python
	but next moment harry had begun to spin very fast, and the dursleys' living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emeraldgreen flames
	chapter five  weasleys' wizard wheezesharry spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to his sides, blurred fireplaces flashing past him, until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes
	then, when at last he felt himself slowing down, he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the weasleys' kitchen fire
	did he eat it said fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull harry to his feeyeah, said harry, straightening up
	what was ittontongue toffee, said fred brightly
	george and i invented them, and we've been looking for someone to test them on all summer
	the tiny kitchen exploded with laughter harry looked around and saw that ron and george were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two redhaired people harry had never seen before, though he knew immediately who they must be bill and charlie, the two eldest weasley brothers
	how're you doing, harry said the nearer of the two, grinning at him and holding out a large hand, which harry shook, feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers
	this had to be charlie, who worked with dragons in romania
	charlie was built like the twins, shorter and stockier than percy and ron, who were both long and lanky
	he had a broad, goodnatured face, which was weatherbeaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned his arms were muscular, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it
	bill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook harry's hand
	bill came as something of a surprise
	harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank, gringotts, and that bill had been head boy at hogwarts harry had always imagined bill to be an older version of percy  fussy about rulebreaking and fond of bossing everyone around
	however, bill was  there was no other word for it  cool
	he was tall, with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail
	he was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it
	bill's clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert, except that harry recognized his boots to be made, not of leather, but of dragon hide
	before any of them could say anything else, there was a faint popping noise, and mr
	weasley appeared out of thin air at george's shoulder
	he was looking angrier than harry had ever seen him
	that wasn't funny fred he shouted
	what on earth did you give that muggle boyi didn't give him anything, said fred, with another evil grin
	it was his fault he went and ate it, i never told him to
	you dropped it on purpose roared mr
	you knew he'd eat it, you knew he was on a diet how big did his tongue get george asked eagerly
	it was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink itharry and the weasleys roared with laughter again
	that sort of behavior seriously undermines wizardmuggle relations  i spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of muggles, and my own sonswe didn't give it to him because he's a muggle said fred indignantly
	no, we gave it to him because he's a great bullying git, said george
	isn't he, harryyeah, he is, mr
	weasley, said harry earnestly
	that's not the point raged mr
	you wait until i tell your mother tell me what said a voice behind them
	weasley had just entered the kitchen
	she was a short, plump woman with a very kind face, though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion
	oh hello, harry, dear, she said, spotting him and smiling
	then her eyes snapped back to her husband
	tell me what, arthurmr
	harry could tell that, however angry he was with fred and george, he hadn't really intended to tell mrs
	weasley what had happened
	there was a silence, while mr
	weasley eyed his wife nervously
	then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind mrs
	one, with very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth, was harry's and ron's friend, hermione granger
	the other, who was small and redhaired, was ron's younger sister, ginny
	both of them smiled at harry, who grinned back, which made ginny go scarlet  she had been very taken with harry ever since his first visit to the burrow
	tell me what, arthur  mrs
	weasley repeated, in a dangerous sort of voice
	it's nothing, molly, mumbled mr
	weasley, fred and george just  but i've had words with them what have they done this time said mrs
	if it's got anything to do with weasleys' wizard wheezes why don't you show harry where he's sleeping, ron said hermione from the doorway
	he knows where he's sleeping, said ron, in my room, he slept there last we can all go, said hermione pointedly
	oh, said ron, cottoning on
	yeah, we'll come too, said george
	you stay where you are snarled mrs
	harry and ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, hermione, and ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories
	what are weasleys' wizard wheezes harry asked as they climbed
	ron and ginny both laughed, although hermione didn't
	mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning fred and george's room, said ron quietly
	great long price lists for stuff they've invented
	joke stuff, you know
	fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff
	it was brilliant, i never knew they'd been inventing all that
	we've been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never thought they were actually making things, said ginny
	we thought they just liked the noise
	only, most of the stuff  well, all of it, really  was a bit dangerous, said ron, and, you know, they were planning to sell it at hogwarts to make some money, and mum went mad at them
	told them they weren't allowed to make any more of it, and burned all the order forms
	she's furious at them anyway
	they didn't get as many o
	s were ordinary wizarding levels, the examinations hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen
	and then there was this big row, ginny said, because mum wants them to go into the ministry of magic like dad, and they told her all they want to do is open a joke shop
	just then a door on the second landing opened, and a face poked out wearing hornrimmed glasses and a very annoyed expression
	hi, percy, said harry
	oh hello, harry, said percy
	i was wondering who was making all the noise
	i'm trying to work in here, you know i've got a report to finish for the office  and it's rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs
	we're not thundering, said ron irritably
	sorry if we've disturbed the topsecret workings of the ministry of magic
	what are you working on said harry
	a report for the department of international magical cooperation, said percy smugly
	we're trying to standardize cauldron thickness
	some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin  leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year that'll change the world, that report will, said ron
	front page of the daily prophet, i expect, cauldron leaks
	percy went slightly pink
	you might sneer, ron, he said heatedly, but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallowbottomed products that seriously endanger yeah, yeah, all right, said ron, and he started off upstairs again
	percy slammed his bedroom door shut
	as harry, hermione, and ginny followed ron up three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them
	it sounded as though mr
	weasley had told mrs
	weasley about the toffees
	the room at the top of the house where ron slept looked much as it had the last time that harry had come to stay the same posters of ron's favorite quidditch team, the chudley cannons, were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the fish tank on the windowsill, which had previously held frog spawn, now contained one extremely large frog
	ron's old rat, scabbers, was here no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered ron's letter to harry in privet drive
	it was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering madly
	shut up, pig, said ron, edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room
	fred and george are in here with us, because bill and charlie are in their room, he told harry
	percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he's got to work
	er  why are you calling that owl pig harry asked ron
	because he's being stupid, said ginny, its proper name is pigwidgeon
	yeah, and that's not a stupid name at all, said ron sarcastically
	ginny named him, he explained to harry
	she reckons it's sweet
	and i tried to change it, but it was too late, he won't answer to anything else
	i've got to keep him up here because he annoys errol and hermes
	he annoys me too, come to that
	pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting shrilly
	harry knew ron too well to take him seriously
	he had moaned continually about his old rat, scabbers, but had been most upset when hermione's cat, crookshanks, appeared to have eaten him
	where's crookshanks harry asked hermione now
	out in the garden, i expect, she said
	he likes chasing gnomes
	he's never seen any before
	percy's enjoying work, then  said harry, sitting down on one of the beds and watching the chudley cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the ceiling
	enjoying it  said ron darkly
	i don't reckon he'd come home if dad didn't make him
	just don't get him onto the subject of his boss
	as i was saying to mr
	crouch is of the opinion
	crouch was telling me
	they'll be announcing their engagement any day now
	have you had a good summer, harry  said hermione
	did you get our food parcels and everythingyeah, thanks a lot,  said harry
	they saved my life, those cakes
	and have you heard from   ron began, but at a look from hermione he fell silent
	harry knew ron had been about to ask about sirius
	ron and hermione had been so deeply involved in helping sirius escape from the ministry of magic that they were almost as concerned about harry's godfather as he was
	however, discussing him in front of ginny was a bad idea
	nobody but themselves and professor dumbledore knew about how sirius had escaped, or believed in his innocence
	i think they've stopped arguing, said hermione, to cover the awkward moment, because ginny was looking curiously from ron to harry
	shall we go down and help your mum with dinneryeah, all right, said ron
	the four of them left ron's room and went back downstairs to find mrs
	weasley alone in the kitchen, looking extremely badtempered
	we're eating out in the garden, she said when they came in
	there's just not room for eleven people in here
	could you take the plates outside, girls  bill and charlie are setting up the tables
	knives and forks, please, you two, she said to ron and harry, pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink, which shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off the walls and ceiling
	oh for heaven's sake, she snapped, now directing her wand at a dustpan, which hopped off the sideboard and started skating across the floor, scooping up the potatoes
	those two she burst out savagely, now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard, and harry knew she meant fred and george
	i don't know what's going to happen to them, i really don't
	no ambition, unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly can
	weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table and began to wave her wand around inside it
	a creamy sauce poured from the wand tip as she stirred
	it's not as though they haven't got brains, she continued irritably, taking the saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand, but they're wasting them, and unless they pull themselves together soon, they'll be in real trouble
	i've had more owls from hogwarts about them than the rest put together
	if they carry on the way they're going, they'll end up in front of the improper use of magic office
	weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer, which shot open
	harry and ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it, flew across the kitchen, and began chopping the potatoes, which had just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpan
	i don't know where we went wrong with them, said mrs
	weasley, putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans
	it's been the same for years, one thing after another, and they won't listen to  oh not againshe had picked up her wand from the table, and it had emitted a loud squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouse
	one of their fake wands again she shouted
	how many times have i told them not to leave them lying aroundshe grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on the stove was smoking
	c'mon, ron said hurriedly to harry, seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer, let's go and help bill and charlie
	weasley and headed out the back door into the yard
	they had only gone a few paces when hermione's bandylegged ginger cat, crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottlebrush tail held high in the air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs
	harry recognized it instantly as a gnome
	barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the wellington boots that lay scattered around the door
	harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to reach it
	meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the house
	the source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden, and saw that bill and charlie both had their wands out, and were making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each other, each attempting to knock the other's out of the air
	fred and george were cheering, ginny was laughing, and hermione was hovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiety
	bill's table caught charlie's with a huge bang and knocked one of its legs off
	there was a clatter from overhead, and they all looked up to see percy's head poking out of a window on the second floor
	will you keep it down he bellowed
	sorry, perce, said bill, grinning
	how're the cauldron bottoms coming onvery badly, said percy peevishly, and he slammed the window shut
	chuckling, bill and charlie directed the tables safely onto the grass, end to end, and then, with a flick of his wand, bill reattached the table leg and conjured tablecloths from nowhere
	by seven o'clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of mrs
	weasley's excellent cooking, and the nine weasleys, harry, and hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deepblue sky
	to somebody who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer, this was paradise, and at first, harry listened rather than talked as he helped himself to chicken and ham pie, boiled potatoes, and salad
	at the far end of the table, percy was telling his father all about his report on cauldron bottoms
	crouch that i'll have it ready by tuesday, percy was saying pompously
	that's a bit sooner than he expected it, but i like to keep on top of things
	i think he'll be grateful i've done it in good time, i mean, its extremely busy in our department just now, what with all the arrangements for the world cup
	we're just not getting the support we need from the department of magical games and sports
	ludo bagman i like ludo, said mr
	he was the one who got us such good tickets for the cup
	i did him a bit of a favor  his brother, otto, got into a spot of trouble  a lawnmower with unnatural powers  i smoothed the whole thing over
	oh bagman's likable enough, of course, said percy dismissively, but how he ever got to be head of department
	when i compare him to mr
	crouch  i can't see mr
	crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out what's happened to them
	you realize bertha jorkins has been missing for over a month now  went on holiday to albania and never came backyes, i was asking ludo about that, said mr
	he says bertha's gotten lost plenty of times before now  though must say, if it was someone in my department, i'd be worried
	oh bertha's hopeless, all right, said percy
	i hear she's been shunted from department to department for years, much more trouble than she's worth
	but all the same, bagman ought to be trying to find her
	crouch has been taking a personal interest, she worked in our department at one time, you know, and i think mr
	crouch was quite fond of her  but bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in australia instead of albania
	however  percy heaved an impressive sigh and took a deep swig of elderflower wine  we've got quite enough on our plates at the department of international magical cooperation without trying to find members of other departments too
	as you know, we've got another big event to organize right after the world cup
	percy cleared his throat significantly and looked down toward the end of the table where harry, ron, and hermione were sitting
	you know the one i'm talking about, father
	he raised his voice slightly
	ron rolled his eyes and muttered to harry and hermione, he's been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work
	probably an exhibition of thickbottomed cauldrons
	in the middle of the table, mrs
	weasley was arguing with bill about his earring, which seemed to be a recent acquisition
	with a horrible great fang on it
	really, bill, what do they say at the bankmum,
	no one at the bank gives a damn how i dress as long as i bring home plenty of treasure, said bill patiently
	and your hair's getting silly, dear, said mrs
	weasley, fingering her wand lovingly
	i wish you'd let me give it a trim
	i like it, said ginny, who was sitting beside bill
	you're so oldfashioned, mum
	anyway, it's nowhere near as long as professor dumbledore's
	weasley, fred, george, and charlie were all talking spiritedly about the world cup
	it's got to be ireland, said charlie thickly, through a mouthful of potato
	they flattened peru in the semifinals
	bulgaria has got viktor krum, though, said fred
	krum's one decent player, ireland has got seven, said charlie shortly
	i wish england had got through
	that was embarrassing, that was
	what happened said harry eagerly, regretting more than ever his isolation from the wizarding world when he was stuck on privet drive
	went down to transylvania, three hundred and ninety to ten, said charlie gloomily
	shocking performance
	and wales lost to uganda, and scotland was slaughtered by luxembourg
	harry had been on the gryffindor house quidditch team ever since his first year at hogwarts and owned one of the best racing brooms in the world, a firebolt
	flying came more naturally to harry than anything else in the magical world, and he played in the position of seeker on the gryffindor house team
	weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had their homemade strawberry ice cream, and by the time they had finished, moths were fluttering low over the table, and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle
	harry was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes, laughing madly and closely pursued by crookshanks
	ron looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all busy talking, then he said very quietly to harry, so  have you heard from sirius latelyhermione looked around, listening closely
	yeah, said harry softly, twice
	i wrote to him yesterday
	he might write back while i'm here
	he suddenly remembered the reason he had written to sirius, and for a moment was on the verge of telling ron and hermione about his scar hurting again, and about the dream that had awoken him
	but he really didn't want to worry them just now, not when he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful
	look at the time, mrs
	weasley said suddenly, checking her wristwatch
	you really should be in bed, the whole lot of you you'll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the cup
	harry, if you leave your school list out, i'll get your things for you tomorrow in diagon alley
	i'm getting everyone else's
	there might not be time after the world cup, the match went on for five days last time
	wow  hope it does this time said harry enthusiastically
	well, i certainly don't, said percy sanctimoniously
	i shudder to think what the state of my intray would be if i was away from work for five days
	yeah, someone might slip dragon dung in it again, eh, perce  said fred
	that was a sample of fertilizer from norway  said percy, going very red in the face
	it was nothing personalit was, fred whispered to harry as they got up from the table
	chapter six  the portkeyharry felt as though he had barely lain down to steep in ron's room when he was being shaken awake by mrs
	time to go, harry, dear, she whispered, moving away to wake ron
	harry felt around for his glasses, put them on, and sat up
	it was still dark outside
	ron muttered indistinctly as his mother roused him
	at the foot of harry's mattress he saw two large, disheveled shapes emerging from tangles of blankets
	's' time already  said fred groggily
	they dressed in silence, too sleepy to talk, then, yawning and stretching, the four of them headed downstairs into the kitchen
	weasley was stirring the contents of a large pot on the stove, while mr
	weasley was sitting at the table, checking a sheaf of large parchment tickets
	he looked up as the boys entered and spread his arms so that they could see his clothes more clearly
	he was wearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater and a very old pair of jeans, slightly too big for him and held up with a thick leather belt
	what d'you think  he asked anxiously
	we're supposed to go incognito  do i look like a muggle, harryyeah, said harry, smiling, very good
	where're bill and charlie and perperpercy  said george, failing to stifle a huge yawn
	well, they're apparating, aren't they  said mrs
	weasley, heaving the large pot over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into bowls
	so they can have a bit of a liein
	harry knew that apparating meant disappearing from one place and reappearing almost instantly in another, but had never known any hogwarts student to do it, and understood that it was very difficult
	so they're still in bed  said fred grumpily, pulling his bowl of porridge toward him
	why can't we apparate toobecause you're not of age and you haven't passed your test, snapped mrs
	and where have those girls got toshe bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her climbing the stairs
	you have to pass a test to apparate  harry asked
	weasley, tucking the tickets safely into the back pocket of his jeans
	the department of magical transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for apparating without a license
	it's not easy, apparition, and when it's not done property it can lead to nasty complications
	this pair i'm talking about went and splinched themselves
	everyone around the table except harry winced
	er  splinched said harry
	they left half of themselves behind, said mr
	weasley, now spooning large amounts of treacle onto his porridge
	so, of course, they were stuck
	couldn't move either way
	had to wait for the accidental magic reversal squad to sort them out
	meant a fair old bit of paperwork, i can tell you, what with the muggles who spotted the body parts they'd left behind
	harry had a sudden vision of a pair of legs and an eyeball lying abandoned on the pavement of privet drive
	were they okay he asked, startled
	weasley matteroffactly
	but they got a heavy fine, and i don't think they'll be trying it again in a hurry
	you don't mess around with apparition
	there are plenty of adult wizards who don't bother with it
	prefer brooms  slower, but safer
	but bill and charlie and percy can all do itcharlie had to take the test twice, said fred, grinning
	he failed the first time
	apparated five miles south of where he meant to, right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping, rememberyes, well, he passed the second time, said mrs
	weasley, marching back into the kitchen amid hearty sniggers
	percy only passed two weeks ago, said george
	he's been apparating downstairs every morning since, just to prove he can
	there were footsteps down the passageway and hermione and ginny came into the kitchen, both looking pale and drowsy
	why do we have to be up so early ginny said, rubbing her eyes and sitting down at the table
	we've got a bit of a walk, said mr
	what, are we walking to the world cup  no, no, that's miles away, said mr
	we only need to walk a short way
	it's just that it's very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting muggle attention
	we have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of times, and on a huge occasion like the quidditch world cup
	weasley sharply, and they all jumped
	what said george, in an innocent tone that deceived nobody
	what is that in your pocketnothingdon't you lie to memrs
	weasley pointed her wand at george's pocket and said, accioseveral small, brightly colored objects zoomed out of george's pocket he made a grab for them but missed, and they sped right into mrs
	weasley's outstretched hand
	we told you to destroy them said mrs
	weasley furiously, holding up what were unmistakably more tontongue toffees
	we told you to get rid of the lot empty your pockets, go on, both of youit was an unpleasant scene the twins had evidently been trying to smuggle as many toffees out of the house as possible, and it was only by using her summoning charm that mrs
	weasley managed to find them all
	accio accio accio she shouted, and toffees zoomed from all sorts of unlikely places, including the lining of george's jacket and the turnups of fred's jeans
	we spent six months developing those  fred shouted at his mother as she threw the toffees away
	oh a fine way to spend six months  she shrieked
	no wonder you didn't get more o
	sall in all, the atmosphere was not very friendly as they took their departure
	weasley was still glowering as she kissed mr
	weasley on the cheek, though not nearly as much as the twins, who had each hoisted their rucksacks onto their backs and walked out without a word to her
	well, have a lovely time, said mrs
	weasley, and behave yourselves, she called after the twins' retreating backs, but they did not look back or answer
	i'll send bill, charlie, and percy along around midday,  mrs
	weasley, as he, harry, ron, hermione, and ginny set off across the dark yard after fred and george
	it was chilly and the moon was still out
	only a dull, greenish tinge along the horizon to their right showed that daybreak was drawing closer
	harry, having been thinking about thousands of wizards speeding toward the quidditch world cup, sped up to walk with mr
	so how does everyone get there without all the muggles noticing he asked
	it's been a massive organizational problem, sighed mr
	the trouble is, about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the world cup, and of course, we just haven't got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all
	there are places muggles can't penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into diagon alley or platform nine and threequarters
	so we had to find a nice deserted moor, and set up as many antimuggle precautions as possible
	the whole ministry's been working on it for months
	first, of course, we have to stagger the arrivals
	people with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand
	a limited number use muggle transport, but we can't have too many clogging up their buses and trains  remember, wizards are coming from all over the world
	some apparate, of course, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear, well away from muggles
	i believe there's a handy wood they're using as the apparition point
	for those who don't want to apparate, or can't, we use portkeys
	they're objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time
	you can do large groups at a time if you need to
	there have been two hundred portkeys placed at strategic points around britain, and the nearest one to us is up at the top of stoatshead hill, so that's where we're headed
	weasley pointed ahead of them, where a large black mass rose beyond the village of ottery st
	what sort of objects are portkeys said harry curiously
	well, they can be anything, said mr
	unobtrusive things, obviously, so muggles don't go picking them up and playing with them
	stuff they'll just think is litter
	they trudged down the dark, dank lane toward the village, the silence broken only by their footsteps
	the sky lightened very slowly as they made their way through the village, its inky blackness diluting to deepest blue
	harry's hands and feet were freezing
	weasley kept checking his watch
	they didn't have breath to spare for talking as they began to climb stoatshead hill, stumbling occasionally in hidden rabbit holes, slipping on thick black tuffets of grass
	each breath harry took was sharp in his chest and his legs were starting to seize up when, at last, his feet found level ground
	weasley, taking off his glasses and wiping them on his sweater
	well, we've made good time  we've got ten minutes
	hermione came over the crest of the hill last, clutching a stitch in her side
	now we just need the portkey, said mr
	weasley, replacing his glasses and squinting around at the ground
	they spread out, searching
	they had only been at it for a couple of minutes, however, when a shout rent the still air
	over here, arthur  over here, son, we've got it
	two tall figures were silhouetted against the starry sky on the other side of the hilltop
	weasley, smiling as he strode over to the man who had shouted
	the rest of them followed
	weasley was shaking hands with a ruddyfaced wizard with a scrubby brown beard, who was holding a moldylooking old boot in his other hand
	this is amos diggory, everyone, said mr
	he works for the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures
	and i think you know his son, cedriccedric diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen
	he was captain and seeker of the hufflepuff house quidditch team at hogwarts
	hi, said cedric, looking around at them all
	everybody said hi back except fred and george, who merely nodded
	they had never quite forgiven cedric for beating their team, gryffindor, in the first quidditch match of the previous year
	long walk, arthur  cedric's father asked
	not too bad, said mr
	we live just on the other side of the village there
	youhad to get up at two, didn't we, ced  i tell you, i'll be glad when he's got his apparition test
	quidditch world cup, wouldn't miss it for a sackful of galleons  and the tickets cost about that
	mind you, looks like i got off easy
	amos diggory peered goodnaturedly around at the three weasley boys, harry, hermione, and ginny
	all these yours, arthuroh no, only the redheads, said mr
	weasley, pointing out his children
	this is hermione, friend of ron's  and harry, another friend merlin's beard, said amos diggory, his eyes widening
	harry harry potterer  yeah, said harry
	harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him, used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it always made him feel uncomfortable
	ced's talked about you, of course, said amos diggory
	told us all about playing against you last year
	i said to him, i said  ced, that'll be something to tell your grandchildren, that will
	you beat harry potterharry couldn't think of any reply to this, so he remained silent
	fred and george were both scowling again
	cedric looked slightly embarrassed
	harry fell off his broom, dad, he muttered
	yes, but you didn't fall off, did you roared amos genially, slapping his son on his back
	always modest, our ced, always the gentleman
	but the best man won, i'm sure harry'd say the same, wouldn't you, eh  one falls off his broom, one stays on, you don't need to be a genius to tell which one's the better fliermust be nearly time, said mr
	weasley quickly, pulling out his watch again
	do you know whether we're waiting for any more, amosno, the lovegoods have been there for a week already and the fawcetts couldn't get tickets, said mr
	there aren't any more of us in this area, are therenot that i know of, said mr
	yes, it's a minute off
	we'd better get ready
	he looked around at harry and hermione
	you just need to touch the portkey, that's all, a finger will do with difficulty, owing to their bulky backpacks, the nine of them crowded around the old boot held out by amos diggory
	they all stood there, in a tight circle, as a chill breeze swept over the hilltop
	it suddenly occurred to harry how odd this would look if a muggle were to walk up here now
	nine people, two of them grown men, clutching this manky old boot in the semidarkness, waiting
	weasley, one eye still on his watch, two
	it happened immediately  harry felt as though a hook just behind his navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward
	his feet left the ground he could feel ron and hermione on either side of him, their shoulders banging into his they were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color his forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and then his feet slammed into the ground ron staggered into him and he fell over the portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy thud
	diggory, and cedric were still standing, though looking very windswept everybody else was on the ground
	seven past five from stoatshead hill, said a voice
	chapter seven  bagman and crouchharry disentangled himself from ron and got to his feet
	they had arrived on what appeared to be a deserted stretch of misty moor
	in front of them was a pair of tired and grumpylooking wizards, one of whom was holding a large gold watch, the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill
	both were dressed as muggles, though very inexpertly  the man with the watch wore a tweed suit with thighlength galoshes his colleague, a kilt and a poncho
	morning, basil, said mr
	weasley, picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard, who threw it into a large box of used portkeys beside him harry could see an old newspaper, an empty drinks can, and a punctured football
	hello there, arthur, said basil wearily
	not on duty, eh  it's all right for some
	we've been here all night
	you'd better get out of the way, we've got a big party coming in from the black forest at five fifteen
	hang on, i'll find your campsite
	he consulted his parchment list
	about a quarter of a mile's walk over there, first field you come to
	site manager's called mr
	thanks, basil, said mr
	weasley, and he beckoned everyone to follow him
	they set off across the deserted moor, unable to make out much through the mist
	after about twenty minutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view
	beyond it, harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon
	they said goodbye to the diggorys and approached the cottage door
	a man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents
	harry knew at a glance that this was the only real muggle for several acres
	when he heard their footsteps, he turned his head to look at them
	morning, said the muggle
	robertsaye, i would, said mr
	and who're youweasley  two tents, booked a couple of days agoaye, said mr
	roberts, consulting a list tacked to the door
	you've got a space up by the wood there
	just the one nightthat's it, said mr
	you'll be paying now, then said mr
	ah  right  certainly  said mr
	he retreated a short distance from the cottage and beckoned harry toward him
	help me, harry, he muttered, pulling a roll of muggle money from his pocket and starting to peel the notes apart
	this one's a  a  a ten  ah yes, i see the little number on it now
	so this is a fivea twenty, harry corrected him in an undertone, uncomfortably aware of mr
	roberts trying to catch every word
	i don't know, these little bits of paper
	weasley returned with the correct notes
	you're not the first one who's had trouble with money, said mr
	roberts, scrutinizing mr
	i had two try and pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago
	did you really said mr
	roberts rummaged around in a tin for some change
	never been this crowded, he said suddenly, looking out over the misty field again
	hundreds of prebookings
	people usually just turn up
	is that right said mr
	weasley, his hand held out for his change, but mr
	roberts didn't give it to him
	aye, he said thoughtfully
	people from all over
	loads of foreigners
	and not just foreigners
	weirdos, you know  there's a bloke walking 'round in a kilt and a poncho
	shouldn't he  said mr
	weasley anxiouslyit's like some sort of
	like some sort of rally, said mr
	they all seem to know each other
	at that moment, a wizard in plusfours appeared out of thin air next to mr
	roberts's front door
	obliviate he said sharply, pointing his wand at mr
	roberts's eyes slid out of focus, his brows unknitted, and a took of dreamy unconcern fell over his face
	harry recognized the symptoms of one who had just had his memory modified
	a map of the campsite for you, mr
	roberts said placidly to mr
	thanks very much, said mr
	the wizard in plusfours accompanied them toward the gate to the campsite
	he looked exhausted  his chin was blue with stubble and there were deep purple shadows under his eyes
	once out of earshot of mr
	roberts, he muttered to mr
	weasley, been having a lot of trouble with him
	needs a memory charm ten times a day to keep him happy
	and ludo bagman's not helping
	trotting around talking about bludgers and quaffles at the top of his voice, not a worry about antimuggle security blimey, i'll be glad when this is over
	see you later, arthur
	bagman was head of magical games and sports, said ginny, looking surprised
	he should know better than to talk about bludgers near muggles, shouldn't hehe should, said mr
	weasley, smiling, and leading them through the gates into the campsite, but ludo's always been a bit
	you couldn't wish for a more enthusiastic head of the sports department though
	he played quidditch for england himself, you know
	and he was the best beater the wimbourne wasps ever had
	they trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents
	most looked almost ordinary their owners had clearly tried to make them as mugglelike as possible, but had slipped up by adding chimneys, or bellpulls, or weather vanes
	however, here and there was a tent so obviously magical that harry could hardly be surprised that mr
	roberts was getting suspicious
	halfway up the field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace, with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance
	a little farther on they passed a tent that had three floors and several turrets and a short way beyond that was a tent that had a front garden attached, complete with birdbath, sundial, and fountain
	always the same, said mr
	we can't resist showing off when we get together
	ah, here we are, look, this is us
	they had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the field, and here was an empty space, with a small sign hammered into the ground that read weezly
	couldn't have a better spot said mr
	the field is just on the other side of the wood there, we're as close as we could be
	he hoisted his backpack from his shoulders
	right, he said excitedly, no magic allowed, strictly speaking, not when we're out in these numbers on muggle land
	we'll be putting these tents up by hand  shouldn't be too difficult
	muggles do it all the time
	here, harry, where do you reckon we should startharry had never been camping in his life the dursleys had never taken him on any kind of holiday, preferring to leave him with mrs
	figg, an old neighbor
	however, he and hermione worked out where most of the poles and pegs should go, and though mr
	weasley was more of a hindrance than a help, because he got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet, they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby twoman tents
	all of them stood back to admire their handiwork
	nobody looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards, harry thought, but the trouble was that once bill, charlie, and percy arrived, they would be a party of ten
	hermione seemed to have spotted this problem too she gave harry a quizzical look as mr
	weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent
	we'll be a bit cramped, he called, but i think we'll all squeeze in
	come and have a look
	harry bent down, ducked under the tent flap, and felt his jaw drop
	he had walked into what looked like an oldfashioned, three room flat, complete with bathroom and kitchen
	oddly enough, it was furnished in exactly the same sort of style as mrs
	figg's house  there were crocheted covers on the mismatched chairs and a strong smell of cats
	well, it's not for long, said mr
	weasley, mopping his bald patch with a handkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom
	i borrowed this from perkins at the office
	doesn't camp much anymore, poor fellow, he's got lumbago
	he picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it
	there's a tap marked on this map the muggle gave us, said ron, who had followed harry inside the tent and seemed completely unimpressed by its extraordinary inner proportions
	it's on the other side of the field
	well, why don't you, harry, and hermione go and get us some water then  mr
	weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans  and the rest of us will get some wood for a firebut we've got an oven, said ron
	why can't we just ron, antimuggle security  said mr
	weasley, his face shining with anticipation
	when real muggles camp, they cook on fires outdoors
	i've seen them at itafter a quick tour of the girls' tent, which was slightly smaller than the boys', though without the smell of cats, harry, ron, and hermione set off across the campsite with the kettle and saucepans
	now, with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting, they could see the city of tents that stretched in every direction
	they made their way slowly through the rows, staring eagerly around
	it was only just dawning on harry how many witches and wizards there must be in the world he had never really thought much about those in other countries
	their fellow campers were starting to wake up
	first to stir were the families with small children harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before
	a tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramidshaped tent, holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami
	as they drew level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the tent
	how many times, kevin  you don't  touch  daddy's  wand  yecchh she had trodden on the giant slug, which burst
	her scolding carried after them on the still air, mingling with the little boy's yells  you bust slug  you bust sluga short way farther on, they saw two little witches, barely older than kevin, who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls' toes to skim the dewy grass
	a ministry wizard had already spotted them as he hurried past harry, ron, and hermione he muttered distractedly, in broad daylight  parents having a liein, i suppose here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and starting to cook breakfast
	some, with furtive looks around them, conjured fires with their wands others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces, as though sure this couldn't work
	three african wizards sat in serious conversation, all of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked like a rabbit on a bright purple fire, while a group of middleaged american witches sat gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched between their tents that read  the salem witches' institute
	harry caught snatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they passed, and though he couldn't understand a word, the tone of every single voice was excited
	er  is it my eyes, or has everything gone green said ron
	it wasn't just ron's eyes
	they had walked into a patch of tents that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks, so that it looked as though small, oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth
	grinning faces could be seen under those that had their flaps open
	then, from behind them, they heard their names
	harry  ron  hermioneit was seamus finnigan, their fellow gryffindor fourth year
	he was sitting in front of his own shamrockcovered tent, with a sandyhaired woman who had to be his mother, and his best friend, dean thomas, also of gryffindor
	like the decorations said seamus, grinning
	the ministry's not too happy
	ah, why shouldn't we show our colors  said mrs
	you should see what the bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents
	you'll be supporting ireland, of course she added, eyeing harry, ron, and hermione beadily
	when they had assured her that they were indeed supporting ireland, they set off again, though, as ron said, like we'd say anything else surrounded by that lot
	i wonder what the bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents  said hermione
	let's go and have a look, said harry, pointing to a large patch of tents upfield, where the bulgarian flag  white, green, and red  was fluttering in the breeze
	the tents here had not been bedecked with plant life, but each and every one of them had the same poster attached to it, a poster of a very surly face with heavy black eyebrows
	the picture was, of course, moving, but all it did was blink and scowl
	krum, said ron quietly
	viktor krum, the bulgarian seekerhe looks really grumpy, said hermione, looking around at the many krums blinking and scowling at them
	'really grumpy  ron raised his eyes to the heavens
	who cares what he looks like he's unbelievable
	he's really young too
	only just eighteen or something
	he's a genius, you wait until tonight, you'll see
	there was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field
	harry, ron, and hermione joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument
	one of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown
	the other was clearly a ministry wizard he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation
	just put them on, archie, there's a good chap
	you can't walk around like that, the muggle at the gate's already getting suspicious i bought this in a muggle shop, said the old wizard stubbornly
	muggle women wear them, archie, not the men, they wear these, said the ministry wizard, and he brandished the pinstriped trousers
	i'm not putting them on, said old archie in indignation
	i like a healthy breeze 'round my privates, thanks
	hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when archie had collected his water and moved away
	walking more slowly now, because of the weight of the water, they made their way back through the campsite
	here and there, they saw more familiar faces  other hogwarts students with their families
	oliver wood, the old captain of harry's house quidditch team, who had just left hogwarts, dragged harry over to his parents' tent to introduce him, and told him excitedly that he had just been signed to the puddlemere united reserve team
	next they were hailed by ernie macmillan, a hufflepuff fourth year, and a little farther on they saw cho chang, a very pretty girl who played seeker on the ravenclaw team
	she waved and smiled at harry, who slopped quite a lot of water down his front as he waved back
	more to stop ron from smirking than anything, harry hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he had never seen before
	who d'you reckon they are he said
	they don't go to hogwarts, do they'spect they go to some foreign school, said ron
	i know there are others
	never met anyone who went to one, though
	bill had a penfriend at a school in brazil
	this was years and years ago
	and he wanted to go on an exchange trip but mum and dad couldn't afford it
	his penfriend got all offended when he said he wasn't going and sent him a cursed hat
	it made his ears shrivel up
	harry laughed but didn't voice the amazement he felt at hearing about other wizarding schools
	he supposed, now that he saw representatives of so many nationalities in the campsite, that he had been stupid never to realize that hogwarts couldn't be the only one
	he glanced at hermione, who looked utterly unsurprised by the information
	no doubt she had run across the news about other wizarding schools in some book or other
	you've been ages, said george when they finally got back to the weasleys' tents
	met a few people, said ron, setting the water down
	you've not got that fire started yetdad's having fun with the matches, said fred
	weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire, but it wasn't for lack of trying
	splintered matches littered the ground around him, but he looked as though he was having the time of his life
	oops he said as he managed to light a match and promptly dropped it in surprise
	weasley, said hermione kindly, taking the box from him, and showing him how to do it properly
	at last they got the fire lit, though it was at least another hour before it was hot enough to cook anything
	there was plenty to watch while they waited, however
	their tent seemed to be pitched right alongside a kind of thoroughfare to the field, and ministry members kept hurrying up and down it, greeting mr
	weasley cordially as they passed
	weasley kept up a running commentary, mainly for harry's and hermione's benefit his own children knew too much about the ministry to be greatly interested
	that was cuthbert mockridge, head of the goblin liaison office
	here comes gilbert wimple he's with the committee on experimental charms he's had those horns for a while now
	arnold peasegood, he's an obliviator  member of the accidental magic reversal squad, you know
	and that's bode and croaker
	they're unspeakables
	they're whatfrom the department of mysteries, top secret, no idea what they get up to
	at last, the fire was ready, and they had just started cooking eggs and sausages when bill, charlie, and percy came strolling out of the woods toward them
	just apparated, dad, said percy loudly
	ah, excellent, lunchthey were halfway through their plates of eggs and sausages when mr
	weasley jumped to his feet, waving and grinning at a man who was striding toward them
	the man of the moment  ludoludo bagman was easily the most noticeable person harry had seen so far, even including old archie in his flowered nightdress
	he was wearing long quidditch robes in thick horizontal stripes of bright yellow and black
	an enormous picture of a wasp was splashed across his chest
	he had the look of a powerfully built man gone slightly to seed the robes were stretched tightly across a large belly he surely had not had in the days when he had played quidditch for england
	his nose was squashed probably broken by a stray bludger, harry thought, but his round blue eyes, short blond hair, and rosy complexion made him look like a very overgrown schoolboy
	ahoy there  bagman called happily
	he was walking as though he had springs attached to the balls of his feet and was plainly in a state of wild excitement
	arthur, old man, he puffed as he reached the campfire, what a day, eh  what a day could we have asked for more perfect weather  a cloudless night coming
	and hardly a hiccough in the arrangements
	not much for me to dobehind him, a group of haggardlooking ministry wizards rushed past, pointing at the distant evidence of some sort of a magical fire that was sending violet sparks twenty feet into the air
	percy hurried forward with his hand outstretched
	apparently his disapproval of the way ludo bagman ran his department did not prevent him from wanting to make a good impression
	weasley, grinning, this is my son percy
	he's just started at the ministry  and this is fred  no, george, sorry  that's fred  bill, charlie, ron  my daughter, ginny and ron's friends, hermione granger and harry potter
	bagman did the smallest of double takes when he heard harry's name, and his eyes performed the familiar flick upward to the scar on harry's forehead
	weasley continued, this is ludo bagman, you know who he is, it's thanks to him we've got such good tickets bagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it had been nothing
	fancy a flutter on the match, arthur  he said eagerly, jingling what seemed to be a large amount of gold in the pockets of his yellowandblack robes
	i've already got roddy pontner betting me bulgaria will score first  i offered him nice odds, considering ireland's front three are the strongest i've seen in years  and little agatha timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a weeklong match
	a galleon on ireland to wina galleon ludo bagman looked slightly disappointed, but recovered himself
	very well, very well
	any other takersthey're a bit young to be gambling, said mr
	molly wouldn't like we'll bet thirtyseven galleons, fifteen sickles, three knuts, said fred as he and george quickly pooled all their money, that ireland wins  but viktor krum gets the snitch
	oh and we'll throw in a fake wand
	you don't want to go showing mr
	bagman rubbish like that, percy hissed, but bagman didn't seem to think the wand was rubbish at all on the contrary, his boyish face shone with excitement as he took it from fred, and when the wand gave a loud squawk and turned into a rubber chicken, bagman roared with laughter
	excellent i haven't seen one that convincing in years  i'd pay five galleons for thatpercy froze in an attitude of stunned disapproval
	weasley under his breath, i don't want you betting
	that's all your savings
	your mother don't be a spoilsport, arthur  boomed ludo bagman, rattling his pockets excitedly
	they're old enough to know what they want  you reckon ireland will win but krum'll get the snitch  not a chance, boys, not a chance
	i'll give you excellent odds on that one
	we'll add five galleons for the funny wand, then, shall we
	weasley looked on helplessly as ludo bagman whipped out a notebook and quill and began jotting down the twins' names
	cheers, said george, taking the slip of parchment bagman handed him and tucking it away into the front of his robes
	bagman turned most cheerfully back to mr
	couldn't do me a brew, i suppose  i'm keeping an eye out for barty crouch
	my bulgarian opposite number's making difficulties, and i can't understand a word he's saying
	barty'll be able to sort it out
	he speaks about a hundred and fifty languages
	crouch said percy, suddenly abandoning his look of pokerstiff disapproval and positively writhing with excitement
	he speaks over two hundred  mermish and gobbledegook and troll
	anyone can speak troll, said fred dismissively
	all you have to do is point and grunt
	percy threw fred an extremely nasty look and stoked the fire vigorously to bring the kettle back to the boil
	any news of bertha jorkins yet, ludo  mr
	weasley asked as bagman settled himself down on the grass beside them all
	not a dicky bird, said bagman comfortably
	memory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction
	lost, you take my word for it
	she'll wander back into the office sometime in october, thinking it's still july
	you don't think it might be time to send someone to look for her  mr
	weasley suggested tentatively as percy handed bagman his tea
	barty crouch keeps saying that, said bagman, his round eyes widening innocently, but we really can't spare anyone at the moment
	oh  talk of the devil  bartya wizard had just apparated at their fireside, and he could not have made more of a contrast with ludo bagman, sprawled on the grass in his old wasp robes
	barty crouch was a stiff, upright, elderly man, dressed in an impeccably crisp suit and tie
	the parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight, and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a slide rule
	his shoes were very highly polished
	harry could see at once why percy idolized him
	percy was a great believer in rigidly following rules, and mr
	crouch had complied with the rule about muggle dressing so thoroughly that he could have passed for a bank manager harry doubted even uncle vernon would have spotted him for what he really was
	pull up a bit of grass, barry, said ludo brightly, patting the ground beside him
	no thank you, ludo, said crouch, and there was a bite of impatience in his voice
	i've been looking for you everywhere
	the bulgarians are insisting we add another twelve seats to the top box
	oh is that what they're after  said bagman
	i thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers
	bit of a strong accent
	crouch  said percy breathlessly, sunk into a kind of halfbow that made him look like a hunchback
	would you like a cup of teaoh, said mr
	crouch, looking over at percy in mild surprise
	yes  thank you, weatherby
	fred and george choked into their own cups
	percy, very pink around the ears, busied himself with the kettle
	oh and i've been wanting a word with you too, arthur, said mr
	crouch, his sharp eyes falling upon mr
	ali bashir's on the warpath
	he wants a word with you about your embargo on flying carpets
	weasley heaved a deep sigh
	i sent him an owl about that just last week
	if i've told him once i've told him a hundred times  carpets are defined as a muggle artifact by the registry of proscribed charmable objects, but will he listeni doubt it, said mr
	crouch, accepting a cup from percy
	he's desperate to export here
	well, they'll never replace brooms in britain, will they  said bagman
	ali thinks there's a niche in the market for a family vehicle, said mr
	i remember my grandfather had an axminster that could seat twelve  but that was before carpets were banned, of course
	he spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any doubt that all his ancestors had abided strictly by the law
	so, been keeping busy, barty  said bagman breezily
	organizing portkeys across five continents is no mean feat, ludo
	i expect you'll both be glad when this is over  said mr
	ludo bagman looked shocked
	glad  don't know when i've had more fun
	still, it's not as though we haven't got anything to took forward to, eh, barty  eh  plenty left to organize, ehmr
	crouch raised his eyebrows at bagman
	we agreed not to make the announcement until all the details oh details  said bagman, waving the word away like a cloud of midges
	they've signed, haven't they  they've agreed, haven't they  i bet you anything these kids'll know soon enough anyway
	i mean, it's happening at hogwarts ludo, we need to meet the bulgarians, you know, said mr
	crouch sharply, cutting bagman's remarks short
	thank you for the tea, weatherby
	he pushed his undrunk tea back at percy and waited for ludo to rise bagman struggled to his feet, swigging down the last of his tea, the gold in his pockets chinking merrily
	see you all later  he said
	you'll be up in the top box with me  i'm commentating  he waved, barty crouch nodded curtly, and both of them disapparated
	what's happening at hogwarts, dad  said fred at once
	what were they talking aboutyou'll find out soon enough, said mr
	it's classified information, until such time as the ministry decides to release it, said percy stiffly
	crouch was quite right not to disclose it
	oh shut up, weatherby, said fred
	a sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over the campsite as the afternoon wore on
	by dusk, the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with anticipation, and as darkness spread like a curtain over the thousands of waiting wizards, the last vestiges of pretence disappeared  the ministry seemed to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic now breaking out everywhere
	salesmen were apparating every few feet, carrying trays and pushing carts full of extraordinary merchandise
	there were luminous rosettes  green for ireland, red for bulgaria  which were squealing the names of the players, pointed green hats bedecked with dancing shamrocks, bulgarian scarves adorned with lions that really roared, flags from both countries that played their national anthems as they were waved there were tiny models of firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves
	been saving my pocket money all summer for this, ron told harry as they and hermione strolled through the salesmen, buying souvenirs
	though ron purchased a dancing shamrock hat and a large green rosette, he also bought a small figure of viktor krum, the bulgarian seeker
	the miniature krum walked backward and forward over ron's hand, scowling up at the green rosette above him
	wow, look at these  said harry, hurrying over to a cart piled high with what looked like brass binoculars, except that they were covered with all sorts of weird knobs and dials
	omnioculars, said the saleswizard eagerly
	you can replay action
	slow everything down
	and they flash up a playby play breakdown if you need it
	bargain  ten galleons each
	wish i hadn't bought this now, said ron, gesturing at his dancing shamrock hat and gazing longingly at the omnioculars
	three pairs, said harry firmly to the wizard
	no  don't bother, said ron, going red
	he was always touchy about the fact that harry, who had inherited a small fortune from his parents, had much more money than he did
	you won't be getting anything for christmas, harry told him, thrusting omnioculars into his and hermione's hands
	for about ten years, mind
	fair enough, said ron, grinning
	oooh, thanks, harry, said hermione
	and i'll get us some programs, look their money bags considerably lighter, they went back to the tents
	bill, charlie, and ginny were all sporting green rosettes too, and mr
	weasley was carrying an irish flag
	fred and george had no souvenirs as they had given bagman all their gold
	and then a deep, booming gong sounded somewhere beyond the woods, and at once, green and red lanterns blazed into life in the trees, lighting a path to the field
	weasley, looking as excited as any of them
	come on, let's gochapter eight  the quidditch world cupclutching their purchases, mr
	weasley in the lead, they all hurried into the wood, following the lanternlit trail
	they could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them, shouts and laughter, snatches of singing
	the atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious harry couldn't stop grinning
	they walked through the wood for twenty minutes, talking and joking loudly, until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium
	though harry could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field, he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it
	seats a hundred thousand, said mr
	weasley, spotting the awestruck look on harry's face
	ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year
	muggle repelling charms on every inch of it
	every time muggles have got anywhere near here all year, they've suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away again
	bless them, he added fondly, leading the way toward the nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards
	prime seats  said the ministry witch at the entrance when she checked their tickets
	top box  straight upstairs, arthur, and as high as you can go
	the stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple
	they clambered upward with the rest of the crowd, which slowly filtered away through doors into the stands to their left and right
	weasley's party kept climbing, and at last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box, set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goal posts
	about twenty purpleandgilt chairs stood in two rows here, and harry, filing into the front seats with the weasleys, looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagined
	a hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats, which rose in levels around the long oval field
	everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light, which seemed to come from the stadium itself
	the field looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position
	at either end of the field stood three goal hoops, fifty feet high right opposite them, almost at harry's eye level, was a gigantic blackboard
	gold writing kept dashing across it as though an invisible giant's hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it off again watching it, harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the field
	the bluebottle  a broom for all the family  safe, reliable, and with builtin antiburgler buzzer
	shower's all purpose magical mess remover no pain, no stain
	gladrags wizardwear  london, paris, hogsmeade
	harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them
	so far it was empty, except for a tiny creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them
	the creature, whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair, was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga, and it had its face hidden in its hands
	yet those long, batlike ears were oddly familiar
	dobby  said harry incredulously
	the tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers, revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato
	it wasn't dobby  it was, however, unmistakably a houseelf, as harry's friend dobby had been
	harry had set dobby free from his old owners, the malfoy family
	did sir just call me dobby  squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers
	its voice was higher even than dobby's had been, a teeny, quivering squeak of a voice, and harry suspected though it was very hard to tell with a houseelf  that this one might just be female
	ron and hermione spun around in their seats to look
	though they had heard a lot about dobby from harry, they had never actually met him
	weasley looked around in interest
	sorry, harry told the elf, i just thought you were someone i knew
	but i knows dobby too, sir  squeaked the elf
	she was shielding her face, as though blinded by light, though the top box was not brightly lit
	my name is winky, sir  and you, sir  her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon harry's scar
	you is surely harry potteryeah, i am, said harry
	but dobby talks of you all the time, sir s he said, lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck
	how is he  said harry
	how's freedom suiting himah, sir, said winky, shaking her head, ah sir, meaning no disrespect, sir, but i is not sure you did dobby a favor, sir, when you is setting him free
	why said harry, taken aback
	what's wrong with himfreedom is going to dobby's head, sir,  said winky sadly
	ideas above his station, sir
	can't get another position, sir
	winky lowered her voice by a halfoctave and whispered, he is wanting paying for his work, sir
	paying said harry blankly
	well  why shouldn't he be paidwinky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that her face was halfhidden again
	houseelves is not paid, sir  she said in a muffled squeak
	i says to dobby, i says, go find yourself a nice family and settle down, dobby
	he is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a houseelf
	you goes racketing around like this, dobby, i says, and next thing i hear you's up in front of the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures, like some common goblin
	well, it's about time he had a bit of fun, said harry
	houseelves is not supposed to have fun, harry potter, said winky firmly, from behind her hands
	houseelves does what they is told
	i is not liking heights at all, harry potter  she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped  but my master sends me to the top box and i comes, sir
	why's he sent you up here, if he knows you don't like heights  said harry, frowning
	master  master wants me to save him a seat, harry potter
	he is very busy, said winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her
	winky is wishing she is back in master's tent, harry potter, but winky does what she is told
	winky is a good houseelf
	she gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes completely again
	harry turned back to the others
	so that's a houseelf  ron muttered
	weird things, aren't theydobby was weirder, said harry fervently
	ron pulled out his omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadium
	wild  he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side
	i can make that old bloke down there pick his nose again
	hermione, meanwhile, was skimming eagerly through her velvetcovered, tasseled program
	'a display from the team mascots will precede the match,' she read aloud
	oh that's always worth watching, said mr
	national teams bring creatures from their native land, you know, to put on a bit of a show
	the box filled gradually around them over the next half hour
	weasley kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards
	percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog
	when cornelius fudge, the minister of magic himself, arrived, percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered
	highly embarrassed, he repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat, throwing jealous looks at harry, whom cornelius fudge had greeted like an old friend
	they had met before, and fudge shook harry's hand in a fatherly fashion, asked how he was, and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him
	harry potter, you know, he told the bulgarian minister loudly, who was wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and didn't seem to understand a word of english
	oh come on now, you know who he is
	the boy who survived youknowwho
	you do know who he is the bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted harry's scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly, pointing at it
	knew we'd get there in the end, said fudge wearily to harry
	i'm no great shakes at languages i need barty crouch for this sort of thing
	ah, i see his houseelf's saving him a seat
	good job too, these bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the best places
	ah, and here's luciusharry, ron, and hermione turned quickly
	edging along the second row to three stillempty seats right behind mr
	weasley were none other than dobby the houseelf's former owners lucius malfoy his son, draco and a woman harry supposed must be draco's mother
	harry and draco malfoy had been enemies ever since their very first journey to hogwarts
	a pale boy with a pointed face and  whiteblond hair, draco greatly resembled his father
	his mother was blonde too tall and slim, she would have been nicelooking if she hadn't been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose
	malfoy, holding out his hand as he reached the minister of magic
	how are you  i don't think you've met my wife, narcissa  or our son, dracohow do you do, how do you do  said fudge, smiling and bowing to mrs
	and allow me to introduce you to mr
	oblansk  obalonsk  mr
	well, he's the bulgarian minister of magic, and he can't understand a word i'm saying anyway, so never mind
	and let's see who else  you know arthur weasley, i daresayit was a tense moment
	malfoy looked at each other and harry vividly recalled the last time they had come facetoface  it had been in flourish and blotts' bookshop, and they had had a fight
	malfoy's cold gray eyes swept over mr
	weasley, and then up and down the row
	good lord, arthur, he said softly
	what did you have to sell to get seats in the top box  surely your house wouldn't have fetched this muchfudge, who wasn't listening, said, lucius has just given a very generous contribution to st
	mungo's hospital for magical maladies and injuries, arthur
	he's here as my guest
	how  how nice, said mr
	weasley, with a very strained smile
	malfoy's eyes had returned to hermione, who went slightly pink, but stared determinedly back at him
	harry knew exactly what was making mr
	malfoy's lip curl like that
	the malfoys prided themselves on being purebloods in other words, they considered anyone of muggle descent, like hermione, secondclass
	however, under the gaze of the minister of magic, mr
	malfoy didn't dare say anything
	he nodded sneeringly to mr
	weasley and continued down the line to his seats
	draco shot harry, ron, and hermione one contemptuous look, then settled himself between his mother and father
	slimy gits, ron muttered as he, harry, and hermione turned to face the field again
	next moment, ludo bagman charged into the box
	everyone ready  he said, his round face gleaming like a great, excited edam
	minister  ready to goready when you are, ludo, said fudge comfortably
	ludo whipped out his wand, directed it at his own throat, and said sonorus and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium his voice echoed over them, booming into every corner of the stands
	welcome  welcome to the final of the four hundred and twentysecond quidditch world cupthe spectators screamed and clapped
	thousands of flags waved, adding their discordant national anthems to the racket
	the huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message bertie bott's every flavor beans  a risk with every mouthful and now showed bulgaria  0, ireland  0
	and now, without further ado, allow me to introduce
	the bulgarian national team mascotsthe righthand side of the stands, which was a solid block of scarlet, roared its approval
	i wonder what they've brought, said mr
	weasley, leaning forward in his seat
	aaah  he suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes
	veelawhat are veel  but a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and harry's question was answered for him
	the most beautiful women harry had ever seen
	except that they weren't  they couldn't be  human
	this puzzled harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be what could make their skin shine moonbright like that, or their whitegold hair fan out behind them without wind
	but then the music started, and harry stopped worrying about them not being human  in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all
	the veela had started to dance, and harry's mind had gone completely and blissfully blank
	all that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen
	and as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, halfformed thoughts started chasing through harry's dazed mind
	he wanted to do something very impressive, right now
	jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good idea
	but would it be good enoughharry, what are you doing said hermione's voice from a long way off
	he was standing up, and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box
	next to him, ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard
	angry yells were filling the stadium
	the crowd didn't want the veela to go
	harry was with them he would, of course, be supporting bulgaria, and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest
	ron, meanwhile, was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat
	weasley, smiling slightly, leaned over to ron and tugged the hat out of his hands
	you'll be wanting that, he said, once ireland have had their say
	huh  said ron, staring openmouthed at the veela, who had now lined up along one side of the field
	hermione made a loud tutting noise
	she reached up and pulled harry back into his seat
	and now, roared ludo bagman's voice, kindly put your wands in the air
	for the irish national team mascotsnext moment, what seemed to be a great greenandgold comet came zooming into the stadium
	it did one circuit of the stadium, then split into two smaller comets, each hurtling toward the goal posts
	a rainbow arced suddenly across the field, connecting the two balls of light
	the crowd oooohed and aaaaahed, as though at a fireworks display
	now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged they had formed a great shimmering shamrock, which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands
	something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it  excellent  yelled ron as the shamrock soared over them, and heavy gold coins rained from it, bouncing off their heads and seats
	squinting up at the shamrock, harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests, each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green
	weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd, many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold
	there you go, ron yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of gold coins into harry's hand, for the omnioculars  now you've got to buy me a christmas present, hathe great shamrock dissolved, the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from the veela, and settled themselves crosslegged to watch the match
	and now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome  the bulgarian national quidditch team  i give you  dimitrova scarletclad figure on a broomstick, moving so fast it was blurred, shot out onto the field from an entrance far below, to wild applause from the bulgarian supporters

	harry quickly focused his own
	viktor krum was thin, dark, and sallowskinned, with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows
	he looked like an overgrown bird of prey
	it was hard to believe he was only eighteen
	and now, please greet  the irish national quidditch team  yelled bagman

	and here, all the way from egypt, our referee, acclaimed chairwizard of the international association of quidditch, hassan mostafaa small and skinny wizard, completely bald but with a mustache to rival uncle vernon's, wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium, strode out onto the field
	a silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache, and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the other
	harry spun the speed dial on his omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open  four balls burst into the air the scarlet quaffle, the two black bludgers, and harry saw it for the briefest moment, before it sped out of sight the minuscule, winged golden snitch
	with a sharp blast on his whistle, mostafa shot into the air after the balls
	theeeeeeeey're off  screamed bagman
	and it's mullet troy moran dimitrov back to mullet troy levski moranit was quidditch as harry had never seen it played before
	he was pressing his omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose
	the speed of the players was incredible  the chasers were throwing the quaffle to one another so fast that bagman only had time to say their names
	harry spun the slow dial on the right of his omnioculars again, pressed the playbyplay button on the top, and he was immediately watching in slow motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums
	hawkshead attacking formation, he read as he watched the three irish chasers zoom closely together, troy in the center, slightly ahead of mullet and moran, bearing down upon the bulgarians
	porskoff ploy flashed up next, as troy made as though to dart upward with the quaffle, drawing away the bulgarian chaser ivanova and dropping the quaffle to moran
	one of the bulgarian beaters, volkov, swung hard at a passing bludger with his small club, knocking it into moran's path moran ducked to avoid the bludger and dropped the quaffle and levski, soaring beneath, caught it  troy scores roared bagman, and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers
	ten zero to irelandwhat  harry yelled, looking wildly around through his omnioculars
	but levski's got the quaffleharry, if you're not going to watch at normal speed, you're going to miss things shouted hermione, who was dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air while troy did a lap of honor around the field
	harry looked quickly over the top of his omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great, glittering shamrock
	across the field, the veela were watching them sulkily
	furious with himself, harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed
	harry knew enough about quidditch to see that the irish chasers were superb
	they worked as a seamless team, their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one another's minds as they positioned themselves, and the rosette on harry's chest kept squeaking their names troy  mullet  mo ran and within ten minutes, ireland had scored twice more, bringing their lead to thirtyzero and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the greenclad supporters
	the match became still faster, but more brutal
	volkov and vulchanov, the bulgarian beaters, were whacking the bludgers as fiercely as possible at the irish chasers, and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, ivanova managed to break through their ranks dodge the keeper, ryan and score bulgaria's first goal
	fingers in your ears bellowed mr
	weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration
	harry screwed up his eyes too he wanted to keep his mind on the game
	after a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the field
	the veela had stopped dancing, and bulgaria was again in possession of the quaffle
	dimitrov levski dimitrov ivanova  oh i say  roared bagman
	one hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two seekers, krum and lynch, plummeted through the center of the chasers, so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes
	harry followed their descent through his omnioculars, squinting to see where the snitch was  they're going to crash screamed hermione next to harry
	she was half right  at the very last second, viktor krum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off
	lynch, however, hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium
	a huge groan rose from the irish seats
	krum was feintingit's timeout yelled bagman's voice, as trained mediwizards hurry onto the field to examine aidan lynchhe'll be okay, he only got ploughed charlie said reassuringly to ginny, who was hanging over the side of the box, looking horrorstruck
	which is what krum was after, of course
	harry hastily pressed the replay and playbyplay buttons on his omnioculars, twiddled the speed dial, and put them back up to his eyes
	he watched as krum and lynch dived again in slow motion
	wronski defensive feint  dangerous seeker diversion  read the shining purple lettering across his lenses
	he saw krum's face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time, while lynch was flattened, and he understood  krum hadn't seen the snitch at all, he was just making lynch copy him
	harry had never seen anyone fly like that krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless
	harry turned his omnioculars back to normal and focused them on krum
	he was now circling high above lynch, who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion
	harry, focusing still more closely upon krum's face, saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below
	he was using the time while lynch was revived to look for the snitch without interference
	lynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the greenclad supporters, mounted his firebolt, and kicked back off into the air
	his revival seemed to give ireland new heart
	when mostafa blew his whistle again, the chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything harry had seen so far
	after fifteen more fast and furious minutes, ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals
	they were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten, and the game was starting to get dirtier
	as mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again, clutching the quaffle tightly under her arm, the bulgarian keeper, zograf, flew out to meet her
	whatever happened was over so quickly harry didn't catch it, but a scream of rage from the irish crowd, and mostafa's long, shrill whistle blast, told him it had been a foul
	and mostafa takes the bulgarian keeper to task for cobbing  excessive use of elbows  bagman informed the roaring spectators
	and  yes, it's a penalty to irelandthe leprechauns, who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering hornets when mullet had been fouled, now darted together to form the words ha, ha, ha  the veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet, tossed their hair angrily, and started to dance again
	as one, the weasley boys and harry stuffed their fingers into their ears, but hermione, who hadn't bothered, was soon tugging on harry's arm
	he turned to look at her, and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his ears
	look at the referee she said, giggling
	harry looked down at the field
	hassan mostafa had landed right in front of the dancing veela, and was acting very oddly indeed
	he was flexing his muscles and smoothing his mustache excitedly
	now, we can't have that said ludo bagman, though he sounded highly amused
	somebody slap the refereea mediwizard came tearing across the field, his fingers stuffed into his own ears, and kicked mostafa hard in the shins
	mostafa seemed to come to himself harry, watching through the omnioculars again, saw that he looked exceptionally embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela, who had stopped dancing and were looking mutinous
	and unless i'm much mistaken, mostafa is actually attempting to send off the bulgarian team mascots  said bagman's voice
	now there's something we haven't seen before
	oh this could turn nasty
	it did the bulgarian beaters, volkov and vulchanov, landed on either side of mostafa and began arguing furiously with him, gesticulating toward the leprechauns, who had now gleefully formed the words hee, hee, hee
	mostafa was not impressed by the bulgarians' arguments, however he was jabbing his finger into the air, clearly telling them to get flying again, and when they refused, he gave two short blasts on his whistle
	two penalties for ireland shouted bagman, and the bulgarian crowd howled with anger
	and volkov and vulchanov had better get back on those brooms
	and troy takes the quaffle
	play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen
	the beaters on both sides were acting without mercy  volkov and vulchanov in particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with bludger or human as they swung them violently through the air
	dimitrov shot straight at moran, who had the quaffle, nearly knocking her off her broom
	foul  roared the irish supporters as one, all standing up in a great wave of green
	foul  echoed ludo bagman's magically magnified voice
	dimitrov skins moran  deliberately flying to collide there  and it's got to be another penalty  yes, there's the whistlethe leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field
	at this, the veela lost control
	instead of dancing, they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns
	watching through his omnioculars, harry saw that they didn't look remotely beautiful now
	on the contrary, their faces were elongating into sharp, cruelbeaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders and that, boys, yelled mr
	weasley over the tumult of the crowd below, is why you should never go for looks aloneministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the leprechauns, but with little success meanwhile, the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above
	harry turned this way and that, staring through his omnioculars, as the quaffie changed hands with the speed of a bullet
	levski  dimitrov  moran  troy  mullet  ivanova  moran again  moran  moran scoresbut the cheers of the irish supporters were barely heard over the shrieks of the veela, the blasts now issuing from the ministry members' wands, and the furious roars of the bulgarians
	the game recommenced immediately now levski had the quaffle, now dimitrov the irish beater quigley swung heavily at a passing bludger, and hit it as hard as possible toward krum, who did not duck quickly enough
	it hit him full in the face
	there was a deafening groan from the crowd krum's nose looked broken, there was blood everywhere, but hassan mostafa didn't blow his whistle
	he had become distracted, and harry couldn't blame him one of the veela had thrown a handful of fire and set his broom tail alight
	harry wanted someone to realize that krum was injured even though he was supporting ireland, krum was the most exciting player on the field
	ron obviously felt the same
	timeout ah, come on, he can't play like that, look at him look at lynch harry yelled
	for the irish seeker had suddenly gone into a dive, and harry was quite sure that this was no wronski feint this was the real thing
	he's seen the snitch  harry shouted
	he's seen it  look at him gohalf the crowd seemed to have realized what was happening the irish supporters rose in another great wave of green, screaming their seeker on
	but krum was on his tail
	how he could see where he was going, harry had no idea there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind him, but he was drawing level with lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again they're going to crash shrieked hermione
	they're not roared ron
	lynch is yelled harry
	and he was right  for the second time, lynch hit the ground with tremendous force and was immediately stampeded by a horde of angry veela
	the snitch, where's the snitch  bellowed charlie, along the row
	he's got it  krum's got it  it's all over  shouted harry
	krum, his red robes shining with blood from his nose, was rising gently into the air, his fist held high, a glint of gold in his hand
	the scoreboard was flashing bulgaria 160, ireland 170 across the crowd, who didn't seem to have realized what had happened
	then, slowly, as though a great jumbo jet were revving up, the rumbling from the ireland supporters grew louder and louder and erupted into screams of delight
	ireland wins  bagman shouted, who like the irish, seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of the match
	krum gets the snitch  but ireland wins  good lord, i don't think any of us were expecting thatwhat did he catch the snitch for  ron bellowed, even as he jumped up and down, applauding with his hands over his head
	he ended it when ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiothe knew they were never going to catch up  harry shouted back over all the noise, also applauding loudly
	the irish chasers were too good
	he wanted to end it on his terms, that's all
	he was very brave, wasn't he  hermione said, leaning forward to watch krum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling leprechauns and veela to get to him
	he looks a terrible mess
	harry put his omnioculars to his eyes again
	it was hard to see what was happening below, because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the field, but he could just make out krum, surrounded by mediwizards
	he looked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up
	his team members were around him, shaking their heads and looking dejected a short way away, the irish players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from their mascots
	flags were waving all over the stadium, the irish national anthem blared from all sides the veela were shrinking back into their usual, beautiful selves now, though looking dispirited and forlorn
	vell, ve fought bravely, said a gloomy voice behind harry
	he looked around it was the bulgarian minister of magic
	you can speak english  said fudge, sounding outraged
	and you've been letting me mime everything all day veil, it vos very funny, said the bulgarian minister, shrugging
	and as the irish team performs a lap of honor, flanked by their mascots, the quidditch world cup itself is brought into the top box  roared bagman
	harry's eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light, as the top box was magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside
	squinting toward the entrance, he saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box, which they handed to cornelius fudge, who was still looking very disgruntled that he'd been using sign language all day for nothing
	let's have a really loud hand for the gallant losers  bulgaria  bagman shouted
	and up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated bulgarian players
	the crowd below was applauding appreciatively harry could see thousands and thousands of omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction
	one by one, the bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box, and bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with fudge
	krum, who was last in line, looked a real mess
	two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face
	he was still holding the snitch
	harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground
	he was slightly duckfooted and distinctly roundshouldered
	but when krum's name was announced, the whole stadium gave him a resounding, earsplitting roar
	and then came the irish team
	aidan lynch was being supported by moran and connolly the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused
	but he grinned happily as troy and quigley lifted the cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval
	harry's hands were numb with clapping
	at last, when the irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms aidan lynch on the back of confolly's, clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way, bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered, quietus
	they'll be talking about this one for years, he said hoarsely, a really unexpected twist, that
	shame it couldn't have lasted longer
	how muchfor fred and george had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were standing in front of ludo bagman with broad grins on their faces, their hands outstretched
	chapter nine  the dark markdon't tell your mother you've been gambling, mr
	weasley implored fred and george as they all made their way slowly down the purplecarpeted stairs
	don't worry, dad, said fred gleefully, we've got big plans for this money
	we don't want it confiscated
	weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big plans were, but seemed to decide, upon reflection, that he didn't want to know
	they were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back to their campsites
	raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the lanternlit path, and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads, cackling and waving their lanterns
	when they finally reached the tents, nobody felt like sleeping at all, and given the level of noise around them, mr
	weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in
	they were soon arguing enjoyably about the match mr
	weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with charlie, and it was only when ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that mr
	weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed
	hermione and ginny went into the next tent, and harry and the rest of the weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks
	from the other side of the campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd echoing bang
	oh i am glad i'm not on duty, muttered mr
	i wouldn't fancy having to go and tell the irish they've got to stop celebrating
	harry, who was on a top bunk above ron, lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent, watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead, and picturing again some of krum's more spectacular moves
	he was itching to get back on his own firebolt and try out the wronski feint
	somehow oliver wood had never managed to convey with all his wriggling diagrams what that move was supposed to look like
	harry saw himself in robes that had his name on the back, and imagined the sensation of hearing a hundredthousandstrong crowd roar, as ludo bagman's voice echoed throughout the stadium, i give you
	potterharry never knew whether or not he had actually dropped off to sleep  his fantasies of flying like krum might well have slipped into actual dreams  all he knew was that, quite suddenly, mr
	weasley was shouting
	get up ron  harry  come on now, get up, this is urgent harry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit canvas
	dimly, he could tell that something was wrong
	the noises in the campsite had changed
	the singing had stopped
	he could hear screams, and the sound of people running
	he slipped down from the bunk and reached for his clothes, but mr
	weasley, who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas, said, no time, harry  just grab a jacket and get outside  quicklyharry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent, ron at his heels
	by the light of the few fires that were still burning, he could see people running away into the woods, fleeing something that was moving across the field toward them, something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire
	loud jeering, roars of laughter, and drunken yells were drifting toward them then came a burst of strong green light, which illuminated the scene
	a crowd of wizards, tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing straight upward, was marching slowly across the field
	harry squinted at them
	they didn't seem to have faces
	then he realized that their heads were hooded and their faces masked
	high above them, floating along in midair, four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes
	it was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers, and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air
	two of the figures were very small
	more wizards were joining the marching group, laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies
	tents crumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled
	once or twice harry saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of his way with his wand
	several caught fire
	the screaming grew louder
	the floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning tent and harry recognized one of them  mr
	roberts, the campsite manager
	the other three looked as though they might be his wife and children
	one of the marchers below flipped mrs
	roberts upside down with his wand her nightdress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee
	that's sick, ron muttered, watching the smallest muggle child, who had begun to spin like a top, sixty feet above the ground, his head flopping limply from side to side
	hermione and ginny came hurrying toward them, pulling coats over their nightdresses, with mr
	weasley right behind them
	at the same moment, bill, charlie, and percy emerged from the boys' tent, fully dressed, with their sleeves rolled up and their wands out
	we're going to help the ministry  mr
	weasley shouted over all the noise, rolling up his own sleeves
	you lot  get into the woods, and stick together
	i'll come and fetch you when we've sorted this outbill, charlie, and percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming marchers mr
	weasley tore after them
	ministry wizards were dashing from every direction toward the source of the trouble
	the crowd beneath the roberts family was coming ever closer
	c'mon, said fred, grabbing ginny's hand and starting to pull her toward the wood
	harry, ron, hermione, and george followed
	they all looked back as they reached the trees
	the crowd beneath the roberts family was larger than ever they could see the ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the center, but they were having great difficulty
	it looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the roberts family fall
	the colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished
	dark figures were blundering through the trees children were crying anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air
	harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could not see
	then he heard ron yell with pain
	what happened  said hermione anxiously, stopping so abruptly that harry walked into her
	ron, where are you oh this is stupid  lumosshe illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path
	ron was lying sprawled on the ground
	tripped over a tree root, he said angrily, getting to his feet again
	well, with feet that size, hard not to, said a drawling voice from behind them
	harry, ron, and hermione turned sharply
	draco malfoy was standing alone nearby, leaning against a tree, looking utterly relaxed
	his arms folded, he seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees
	ron told malfoy to do something that harry knew he would never have dared say in front of mrs
	language, weasley, said malfoy, his pale eyes glittering
	hadn't you better be hurrying along, now  you wouldn't like her spotted, would youhe nodded at hermione, and at the same moment, a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite, and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them
	what's that supposed to mean said hermione defiantly
	granger, they're after muggles, said malfoy
	d'you want to be showing off your knickers in midair  because if you do, hang around
	they're moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh
	hermione's a witch, harry snarled
	have it your own way, potter, said malfoy, grinning maliciously
	if you think they can't spot a mudblood, stay where you are
	you watch your mouth shouted ron
	everybody present knew that mudblood was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of muggle parentage
	never mind, ron, said hermione quickly, seizing ron's arm to restrain him as he took a step toward malfoy
	there came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything they had heard
	several people nearby screamed
	malfoy chuckled softly
	scare easily, don't they he said lazily
	i suppose your daddy told you all to hide what's he up to  trying to rescue the muggleswhere're your parents said harry, his temper rising
	out there wearing masks, are theymalfoy turned his face to harry, still smiling
	if they were, i wouldn't be likely to tell you, would i, potteroh come on, said hermione, with a disgusted look at malfoy, let's go and find the others
	keep that big bushy head down, granger, sneered malfoy
	come on, hermione repeated, and she pulled harry and ron up the path again
	i'll bet you anything his dad is one of that masked lot said ron hotly
	well, with any luck, the ministry will catch him said hermione fervently
	oh i can't believe this
	where have the others got tofred, george, and ginny were nowhere to be seen, though the path was packed with plenty of other people, all looking nervously over their shoulders toward the commotion back at the campsite
	a huddle of teenagers in pajamas was arguing vociferously a little way along the path
	when they saw harry, ron, and hermione, a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly, o est madame maxime nous l'avons perdue er  what said ron
	the girl who had spoken turned her back on him, and as they walked on they distinctly heard her say, ogwarts
	beauxbatons, muttered hermione
	they must go to beauxbatons, said hermione
	beauxbatons academy of magic
	i read about it in an appraisal ofmagical education in europe
	fred and george can't have gone that far, said ron, pulling out his wand, lighting it like hermione's, and squinting up the path
	harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wand  but it wasn't there
	the only thing he could find was his omnioculars
	ah, no, i don't believe it
	i've lost my wand you're kiddingron and hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams of light farther on the ground harry looked all around him, but his wand was nowhere to be seen
	maybe it's back in the tent, said ron
	maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running hermione suggested anxiously
	yeah, said harry, maybe
	he usually kept his wand with him at all times in the wizarding world, and finding himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very vulnerable
	a rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump
	winky the houseelf was fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby
	she was moving in a most peculiar fashion, apparently with great difficulty it was as though someone invisible were trying to hold her back
	there is bad wizards about she squeaked distractedly as she leaned forward and labored to keep running
	people high  high in the air  winky is getting out of the wayand she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path, panting and squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining her
	what's up with her said ron, looking curiously after winky
	why can't she run properlybet she didn't ask permission to hide, said harry
	he was thinking of dobby  every time he had tried to do something the malfoys wouldn't like, the houseelf had been forced to start beating himself up
	you know, houseelves get a very raw deal said hermione indignantly
	it's slavery, that's what it is  that mr
	crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium, and she was terrified, and he's got her bewitched so she can't even run when they start trampling tents  why doesn't anyone do something about itwell, the elves are happy, aren't they  ron said
	you heard old winky back at the match
	'houseelves is not supposed to have fun'
	that's what she likes, being bossed around
	it's people like you, ron, hermione began hotly, who prop up rotten and unjust systems, just because they're too lazy to another loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood
	let's just keep moving, shall we said ron, and harry saw him glance edgily at hermione
	perhaps there was truth in what malfoy had said perhaps hermione was in more danger than they were
	they set off again, harry still searching his pockets, even though he knew his wand wasn't there
	they followed the dark path deeper into the wood, still keeping an eye out for fred, george, and ginny
	they passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match, and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite
	farther still along the path, they walked into a patch of silvery light, and when they looked through the trees, they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing, surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards, all of whom were talking very loudly
	i pull down about a hundred sacks of galleons a year  one of them shouted
	i'm a dragon killer for the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures
	no, you're not  yelled his friend
	you're a dishwasher at the leaky cauldron
	but i'm a vampire hunter, i've killed about ninety so far a third young wizard, whose pimples were visible even by the dim, silvery light of the veela, now cut in, i'm about to become the youngest ever minister of magic, i am
	harry snorted with laughter
	he recognized the pimply wizard  his name was stan shunpike, and he was in fact a conductor on the tripledecker knight bus
	he turned to tell ron this, but ron's face had gone oddly slack, and next second ron was yelling,  did i tell you i've invented a broomstick that'll reach jupiterhonestly said hermione, and she and harry grabbed ron firmly by the arms, wheeled him around, and marched him away
	by the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely, they were in the very heart of the wood
	they seemed to be alone now everything was much quieter
	i reckon we can just wait here, you know
	we'll hear anyone coming a mile off
	the words were hardly out of his mouth, when ludo bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them
	even by the feeble light of the two wands, harry could see that a great change had come over bagman
	he no longer looked buoyant and rosyfaced there was no more spring in his step
	he looked very white and strained
	who's that he said, blinking down at them, trying to make out their faces
	what are you doing in here, all alonethey looked at one another, surprised
	well  there's a sort of riot going on, said ron
	some people have got hold of a family of muggles
	damn them he said, looking quite distracted, and without another word, he disapparated with a small popnot exactly on top of things, mr
	bagman, is he said hermione, frowning
	he was a great beater, though, said ron, leading the way off the path into a small clearing, and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree
	the wimbourne wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them
	he took his small figure of krum out of his pocket, set it down on the ground, and watched it walk around
	like the real krum, the model was slightly duckfooted and roundshouldered, much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick
	harry was listening for noise from the campsite
	everything seemed much quieter perhaps the riot was over
	i hope the others are okay, said hermione after a while
	they'll be fine, said ron
	imagine if your dad catches lucius malfoy, said harry, sitting down next to ron and watching the small figure of krum slouching over the fallen leaves
	he's always said he'd like to get something on him
	that'd wipe the smirk off old draco's face, all right, said ron
	those poor muggles, though, said hermione nervously
	what if they can't get them downthey will, said ron reassuringly
	mad, though, to do something like that when the whole ministry of magic's out here tonight  said hermione
	i mean, how do they expect to get away with it  do you think they've been drinking, or are they just but she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder
	harry and ron looked quickly around too
	it sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing
	they waited, listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark trees
	but the footsteps came to a sudden halt
	harry got to his feet and peered around the tree
	it was too dark to see very far, but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his vision
	and then, without warning, the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood and it uttered, not a panicked shout, but what sounded like a spell
	morsmordreand something vast, green, and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness harry's eyes had been struggling to penetrate it flew up over the treetops and into the sky
	what the    gasped ron as he sprang to his feet again, staring up at the thing that had appeared
	for a split second, harry thought it was another leprechaun formation
	then he realized that it was a colossal skull, comprised of what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue
	as they watched, it rose higher and higher, blazing in a haze of greenish smoke, etched against the black sky like a new constellation
	suddenly, the wood all around them erupted with screams
	harry didn't understand why, but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull, which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign
	he scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull, but he couldn't see anyone
	who's there he called again
	harry, come on, move  hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward
	what's the matter harry said, startled to see her face so white and terrified
	it's the dark mark, harry hermione moaned, pulling him as hard as she could
	youknowwho's signvoldemort's  harry, come onharry turned  ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature krum  the three of them started across the clearing  but before they had taken a few hurried steps, a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards, appearing from thin air, surrounding them
	harry whirled around, and in an instant, he registered one fact  each of these wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself, ron, and hermione
	without pausing to think, he yelled, duckhe seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground
	stupefy  roared twenty voices  there was a blinding series of flashes and harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing
	raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards' wands, crossing one another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness stop  yelled a voice he recognized
	stop  that's my son harry's hair stopped blowing about
	he raised his head a little higher
	the wizard in front of him had lowered his wand
	he rolled over and saw mr
	weasley striding toward them, looking terrified
	ron  harry  his voice sounded shaky  hermione  are you all rightout of the way, arthur, said a cold, curt voice
	he and the other ministry wizards were closing in on them
	harry got to his feet to face them
	crouch's face was taut with rage
	which of you did it he snapped, his sharp eyes darting between them
	which of you conjured the dark markwe didn't do that said harry, gesturing up at the skull
	we didn't do anything said ron, who was rubbing his elbow and looking indignantly at his father
	what did you want to attack us fordo not lie, sir shouted mr
	his wand was still pointing directly at ron, and his eyes were popping  he looked slightly mad
	you have been discovered at the scene of the crimebarty, whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown, they're kids, barty, they'd never have been able towhere did the mark come from, you three said mr
	over there, said hermione shakily, pointing at the place where they had heard the voice
	there was someone behind the trees
	they shouted words  an incantation  oh, stood over there, did they said mr
	crouch, turning his popping eyes on hermione now, disbelief etched all over his face
	said an incantation, did they you seem very well informed about how that mark is summoned, missy but none of the ministry wizards apart from mr
	crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that harry, ron, or hermione had conjured the skull on the contrary, at hermione's words, they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated, squinting through the dark trees
	we're too late, said the witch in the woolen dressing gown, shaking her head
	they'll have disapparated
	i don't think so, said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard
	it was amos diggory, cedric's father
	our stunners went right through those trees
	there's a good chance we got them
	amos, be careful said a few of the wizards warningly as mr
	diggory squared his shoulders, raised his wand, marched across the clearing, and disappeared into the darkness
	hermione watched him vanish with her hands over her mouth
	a few seconds later, they heard mr
	yes we got them there's someone here unconscious it's  but  blimey
	you've got someone shouted mr
	crouch, sounding highly disbelieving
	who who is itthey heard snapping twigs, the rustling of leaves, and then crunching footsteps as mr
	diggory reemerged from behind the trees
	he was carrying a tiny, limp figure in his arms
	harry recognized the tea towel at once
	crouch did not move or speak as mr
	diggory deposited his elf on the ground at his feet
	the other ministry wizards were all staring at mr
	for a few seconds crouch remained transfixed, his eyes blazing in his white face as he stared down at winky
	then he appeared to come to life again
	this  cannot  be, he said jerkily
	no he moved quickly around mr
	diggory and strode off toward the place where he had found winky
	diggory called after him
	there's no one else there
	crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it
	they could hear him moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside, searching
	diggory said grimly, looking down at winky's unconscious form
	barty crouch's houseelf
	come off it, amos, said mr
	weasley quietly, you don't seriously think it was the elf  the dark mark's a wizard's sign
	diggory, and she had a wand
	diggory held up a wand and showed it to mr
	so that's clause three of the code of wand use broken, for a start
	no nonhuman creature is permitted to carry or use a wand
	just then there was another pop, and ludo bagman apparated right next to mr
	looking breathless and disorientated, he spun on the spot, goggling upward at the emeraldgreen skull
	the dark mark he panted, almost trampling winky as he turned inquiringly to his colleagues
	who did it  did you get them  barry  what's going onmr
	crouch had returned emptyhanded
	his face was still ghostly white, and his hands and his toothbrush mustache were both twitching
	where have you been, barty said bagman
	why weren't you at the match your elf was saving you a seat too  gulping gargoyles  bagman had just noticed winky lying at his feet
	what happened to heri have been busy, ludo, said mr
	crouch, still talking in the same jerky fashion, barely moving his lips
	and my elf has been stunned
	stunned by you lot, you mean but why   comprehension dawned suddenly on bagman's round, shiny face he looked up at the skull, down at winky, and then at mr
	winky  conjure the dark mark  she wouldn't know how  she'd need a wand, for a startand she had one, said mr
	i found her holding one, ludo
	if it's all right with you, mr
	crouch, i think we should hear what she's got to say for herself
	crouch gave no sign that he had heard mr
	diggory seemed to take his silence for assent
	he raised his own wand, pointed it at winky, and said, ennervatewinky stirred feebly
	her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way
	watched by the silent wizards, she raised herself shakily into a sitting position
	she caught sight of mr
	diggory's feet, and slowly, tremulously, raised her eyes to stare up into his face then, more slowly still, she looked up into the sky
	harry could see the floating skull reflected twice in her enormous, glassy eyes
	she gave a gasp, looked wildly around the crowded clearing, and burst into terrified sobs
	do you know who i am  i'm a member of the department for the regulation and control of magical creatureswinky began to rock backward and forward on the ground, her breath coming in sharp bursts
	harry was reminded forcibly of dobby in his moments of terrified disobedience
	as you see, elf, the dark mark was conjured here a short while ago, said mr
	and you were discovered moments later, right beneath it  an explanation, if you pleasei  i  i is not doing it, sir winky gasped
	i is not knowing how, siryou were found with a wand in your hand barked mr
	diggory, brandishing it in front of her
	and as the wand caught the green light that was filling the clearing from the skull above, harry recognized ithey  that's mine he saideveryone in the clearing looked at him
	diggory, incredulously
	that's my wand said harry
	i dropped ityou dropped it repeated mr
	diggory in disbelief
	is this a confession  you threw it aside after you conjured the markamos, think who you're talking to  said mr
	weasley, very angrily
	is harry potter likely to conjure the dark mark er  of course not, mumbled mr
	i didn't drop it there, anyway, said harry, jerking his thumb toward the trees beneath the skull
	i missed it right after we got into the wood
	diggory, his eyes hardening as he turned to look at winky again, cowering at his feet
	you found this wand, eh, elf  and you picked it up and thought you'd have some fun with it, did youi is not doing magic with it, sir  squealed winky, tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and bulbous nose
	i is just picking it up, sir i is not making the dark mark, sir, i is not knowing howit wasn't her said hermione
	she looked very nervous, speaking up in front of all these ministry wizards, yet determined all the same
	winky's got a squeaky little voice, and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper  she looked around at harry and ron, appealing for their support
	it didn't sound anything like winky, did itno, said harry, shaking his head
	it definitely didn't sound like an elf
	yeah, it was a human voice, said ron
	well, we'll soon see, growled mr
	diggory, looking unimpressed
	there's a simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed, elf, did you know thatwinky trembled and shook her head frantically, her ears flapping, as mr
	diggory raised his own wand again and placed it tip to tip with harry's
	prior incantato roared mr
	harry heard hermione gasp, horrified, as a gigantic serpenttongued skull erupted from the point where the two wands met, but it was a mere shadow of the green skull high above them it looked as though it were made of thick gray smoke the ghost of a spell
	diggory shouted, and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of smoke
	diggory with a kind of savage triumph, looking down upon winky, who was still shaking convulsively
	i is not doing it  she squealed, her eyes rolling in terror
	i is not, i is not, i is not knowing how  i is a good elf, i isn't using wands, i isn't knowing howyou've been caught redhanded, elf mr
	caught with the guilty wand in your handamos, said mr
	weasley loudly, think about it
	precious few wizards know how to do that spell
	where would she have learned itperhaps amos is suggesting, said mr
	crouch, cold anger in every syllable, that i routinely teach my servants to conjure the dark markthere was a deeply unpleasant silence
	amos diggory looked horrified
	you have now come very close to accusing the two people in this clearing who are least likely to conjure that mark  barked mr
	harry potter  and myself
	i suppose you are familiar with the boy's story, amosof course  everyone knows  muttered mr
	diggory, looking highly discomforted
	and i trust you remember the many proofs i have given, over a long career, that i despise and detest the dark arts and those who practice them  mr
	crouch shouted, his eyes bulging again
	crouch, i  i never suggested you had anything to do with it  amos diggory muttered again, now reddening behind his scrubby brown beard
	if you accuse my elf, you accuse me, diggory shouted mr
	where else would she have learned to conjure itshe  she might've picked it up anywhere precisely, amos, said mr
	she might have picked it up anywhere
	winky  he said kindly, turning to the elf, but she flinched as though he too was shouting at her
	where exactly did you find harry's wandwinky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently that it was fraying beneath her fingers
	finding it there, sir
	she whispered, there
	you see, amos said mr
	whoever conjured the mark could have disapparated right after they'd done it, leaving harry's wand behind
	a clever thing to do, not using their own wand, which could have betrayed them
	and winky here had the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick it up
	but then, she'd have been only a few feet away from the real culprit said mr
	elf did you see anyonewinky began to tremble worse than ever
	her giant eyes flickered from mr
	diggory, to ludo bagman, and onto mr
	then she gulped and said, i is seeing no one, sir
	crouch curtly, i am fully aware that, in the ordinary course of events, you would want to take winky into your department for questioning
	i ask you, however, to allow me to deal with her
	diggory looked as though he didn't think much of this suggestion at all, but it was clear to harry that mr
	crouch was such an important member of the ministry that he did not dare refuse him
	you may rest assured that she will be punished, mr
	winky stammered, looking up at mr
	crouch, her eyes brimming with tears
	crouch stared back, his face somehow sharpened, each line upon it more deeply etched
	there was no pity in his gaze
	winky has behaved tonight in a manner i would not have believed possible, he said slowly
	i told her to remain in the tent
	i told her to stay there while i went to sort out the trouble
	and i find that she disobeyed me
	no shrieked winky, prostrating herself at mr
	no, master  not clothes, not clothesharry knew that the only way to turn a houseelf free was to present it with proper garments
	it was pitiful to see the way winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over mr
	but she was frightened  hermione burst out angrily, glaring at mr
	your elf's scared of heights, and those wizards in masks were levitating people  you can't blame her for wanting to get out of their waymr
	crouch took a step backward, freeing himself from contact with the elf, whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his overshined shoes
	i have no use for a houseelf who disobeys me, he said coldly,  looking over at hermione
	i have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master, and to her master's reputation
	winky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed around the clearing
	there was a very nasty silence, which was ended by mr
	weasley, who said quietly, well, i think i'll take my lot back to the tent, if nobody's got any objections
	amos, that wand's told us all it can  if harry could have it back, please mr
	diggory handed harry his wand and harry pocketed it
	come on, you three, mr
	weasley said quietly
	but hermione didn't seem to want to move her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf
	weasley said, more urgently
	she turned and followed harry and ron out of the clearing and off through the trees
	what's going to happen to winky said hermione, the moment they had left the clearing
	i don't know, said mr
	the way they were treating her said hermione furiously
	diggory, calling her 'elf' all the time
	crouch  he knows she didn't do it and he's still going to sack her he didn't care how frightened she'd been, or how upset she was  it was like she wasn't even humanwell, she's not, said ron
	hermione rounded on him
	that doesn't mean she hasn't got feelings, ron
	it's disgusting the way hermione, i agree with you, said mr
	weasley quickly, beckoning her on, but now is not the time to discuss elf rights
	i want to get back to the tent as fast as we can
	what happened to the others we lost them in the dark, said ron
	dad, why was everyone so uptight about that skull thingi'll explain everything back at the tent, said mr
	but when they reached the edge of the wood, their progress was impeded
	a large crowd of frightenedlooking witches and wizards was congregated there, and when they saw mr
	weasley coming toward them, many of them surged forward
	what's going on in therewho conjured itarthur  it's not  himof course it's not him, said mr
	we don't know who it was it looks like they disapparated
	now excuse me, please, i want to get to bed
	he led harry, ron, and hermione through the crowd and back into the campsite
	all was quiet now there was no sign of the masked wizards, though several ruined tents were still smoking
	charlie's head was poking out of the boys' tent
	dad, what's going on he called through the dark
	fred, george, and ginny got back okay, but the others i've got them here, said mr
	weasley, bending down and entering the tent
	harry, ron, and hermione entered after him
	bill was sitting at the small kitchen table, holding a bedsheet to his arm, which was bleeding profusely
	charlie had a large rip in his shirt, and percy was sporting a bloody nose
	fred, george, and ginny looked unhurt, though shaken
	did you get them, dad said bill sharply
	the person who conjured the markno, said mr
	we found barry crouch's elf holding harry's wand, but we're none the wiser about who actually conured the mark
	what said bill, charlie, and percy together
	harry's wand said fred
	crouch's elf said percy, sounding thunderstruck
	with some assistance from harry, ron, and hermione, mr
	weasley explained what had happened in the woods
	when they had finished their story, percy swelled indignantly
	crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that  he said
	running away when he'd expressly told her not to
	embarrassing him in front of the whole ministry
	how would that have looked, if she'd been brought up in front of the department for the regulation and control she didn't do anything  she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time  hermione snapped at percy, who looked very taken aback
	hermione had always got on fairly well with percy  better, indeed, than any of the others
	hermione, a wizard in mr
	crouch's position can't afford a houseelf who's going to run amok with a wand  said percy pompously, recovering himself
	she didn't run amok shouted hermione
	she just picked it up off the groundlook, can someone just explain what that skull thing was  said ron impatiently
	it wasn't hurting anyone
	why's it such a big deali told you, it's youknowwho's symbol, ron, said hermione, before anyone else could answer
	i read about it in the rise and fall of the dark arts
	and it hasn't been seen for thirteen years, said mr
	of course people panicked
	it was almost like seeing youknowwho back again
	i don't get it, said ron, frowning
	it's still only a shape in the sky
	ron, youknowwho and his followers sent the dark mark into the air whenever they killed, said mr
	the terror it inspired
	you have no idea, you're too young
	just picture coming home and finding the dark mark hovering over your house, and knowing what you're about to find inside
	everyone's worst fear
	there was silence for a moment
	then bill, removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut, said, well, it didn't help us tonight, whoever conjured it
	it scared the death eaters away the moment they saw it
	they all disapparated before we'd got near enough to unmask any of them
	we caught the robertses before they hit the ground, though
	they're having their memories modified right now
	death eaters said harry
	what are death eatersit's what youknowwho's supporters called themselves, said bill
	i think we saw what's left of them tonight  the ones who managed to keep themselves out of azkaban, anyway
	we can't prove it was them, bill, said mr
	though it probably was, he added hopelessly
	yeah, i bet it was said ron suddenly
	dad, we met draco malfoy in the woods, and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks  and we all know the malfoys were right in with youknowwhobut what were voldemort's supporters  harry began
	everybody flinched  like most of the wizarding world, the weasleys always avoided saying voldemort's name
	sorry, said harry quickly
	what were youknowwho's supporters up to, levitating muggles i mean, what was the pointthe point said mr
	weasley with a hollow laugh
	harry, that's their idea of fun
	half the muggle killings back when youknowwho was in power were done for fun
	i suppose they had a few drinks tonight and couldn't resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large
	a nice little reunion for them, he finished disgustedly
	but if they were the death eaters, why did they disapparate when they saw the dark mark said ron
	they'd have been pleased to see it, wouldn't they use your brains, ron, said bill
	if they really were death eaters, they worked very hard to keep out of azkaban when youknowwho lost power, and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people
	i bet they'd be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back
	they denied they'd ever been involved with him when he lost his powers, and went back to their daily lives
	i don't reckon he'd be overpleased with them, do youso
	whoever conjured the dark mark
	said hermione slowly, were they doing it to show support for the death eaters, or to scare them awayyour guess is as good as ours, hermione, said mr
	but i'll tell you this
	it was only the death eaters who ever knew how to conjure it
	i'd be very surprised if the person who did it hadn't been a death eater once, even if they're not now
	listen, it's very late, and if your mother hears what's happened she'll be worried sick
	we'll get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early portkey out of here
	harry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing
	he knew he ought to feel exhausted it was nearly three in the morning, but he felt wideawake  wideawake, and worried
	three days ago  it felt like much longer, but it had only been three days  he had awoken with his scar burning
	and tonight, for the first time in thirteen years, lord voldemort's mark had appeared in the sky
	what did these things meanhe thought of the letter he had written to sirius before leaving privet drive
	would sirius have gotten it yet  when would he reply  harry lay looking up at the canvas, but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep, and it was a long time after charlie's snores filled the tent that harry finally dozed off
	chapter ten  mayhem at the ministrymr
	weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep
	he used magic to pack up the tents, and they left the campsite as quickly as possible, passing mr
	roberts at the door of his cottage
	roberts had a strange, dazed look about him, and he waved them off with a vague merry christmas
	he'll be all right, said mr
	weasley quietly as they marched off onto the moor
	sometimes, when a person's memory's modified, it makes him a bit disorientated for a while
	and that was a big thing they had to make him forget
	they heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the portkeys lay, and when they reached it, they found a great number of witches and wizards gathered around basil, the keeper of the portkeys, all clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as possible
	weasley had a hurried discussion with basil they joined the queue, and were able to take an old rubber tire back to stoatshead hill before the sun had really risen
	they walked back through ottery st
	catchpole and up the damp lane toward the burrow in the dawn light, talking very little because they were so exhausted, and thinking longingly of their breakfast
	as they rounded the corner and the burrow came into view, a cry echoed along the lane
	oh thank goodness, thank goodnessmrs
	weasley, who had evidently been waiting for them in the front yard, came running toward them, still wearing her bedroom slippers, her face pale and strained, a rolledup copy of the daily prophet clutched in her hand
	arthur  i've been so worried  so worriedshe flung her arms around mr
	weasley's neck, and the daily prophet fell out of her limp hand onto the ground
	looking down, harry saw the headline  scenes of terror at the quidditch world cup, complete with a twinkling blackandwhite photograph of the dark mark over the treetops
	you're all right, mrs
	weasley muttered distractedly, releasing mr
	weasley and staring around at them all with red eyes, you're alive
	and to everybody's surprise, she seized fred and george and pulled them both into such a tight hug that their heads banged together
	ouch  mum  you're strangling us i shouted at you before you left  mrs
	weasley said, starting to sob
	it's all i've been thinking about  what if youknowwho had got you, and the last thing i ever said to you was that you didn't get enough ow
	come on, now, molly, we're all perfectly okay, said mr
	weasley soothingly, prising her off the twins and leading her back toward the house
	bill, he added in an undertone, pick up that paper, i want to see what it says
	when they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen, and hermione had made mrs
	weasley a cup of very strong tea, into which mr
	weasley insisted on pouring a shot of ogdens old firewhiskey, bill handed his father the newspaper
	weasley scanned the front page while percy looked over his shoulder
	culprits not apprehended
	dark wizards running unchecked
	that woman's got it in for the ministry of magic  said percy furiously
	last week she was saying we're wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness, when we should be stamping out vampires  as if it wasn't specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the guidelines for the treatment of nonwizard parthumans do us a favor, perce, said bill, yawning, and shut up
	i'm mentioned, said mr
	weasley, his eyes widening behind his glasses as he reached the bottom of the daily prophet article
	weasley, choking on her tea and whiskey
	if i'd seen that, i'd have known you were alivenot by name, said mr
	listen to this  'if the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the ministry ofmagic, they were sadly disappointed
	a ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the dark mark alleging that nobody had been hurt, but reflising to give any more information
	whether this statement will be enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods an hour later, remains to be seen
	'  oh really, said mr
	weasley in exasperation, handing the paper to percy
	what was i supposed to say  rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods
	well, there certainly will be rumors now she's printed that
	he heaved a deep sigh
	molly, i'm going to have to go into the office this is going to take some smoothing over
	i'll come with you, father, said percy importantly
	crouch will need all hands on deck
	and i can give him my cauldron report in person
	he bustled out of the kitchen
	weasley looked most upset
	arthur, you're supposed to be on holiday this hasn't got anything to do with your office surely they can handle this without youi've got to go, molly, said mr
	i've made things worse
	i'll just change into my robes and i'll be off
	weasley, said harry suddenly, unable to contain himself, hedwig hasn't arrived with a letter for me, has shehedwig, dear said mrs
	weasley distractedly
	no, there hasn't been any post at all
	ron and hermione looked curiously at harry
	with a meaningful look at both of them he said, all right if i go and dump my stuff in your room, ronyeah
	think i will too, said ron at once
	hermioneyes, she said quickly, and the three of them marched out of the kitchen and up the stairs
	what's up, harry said ron, the moment they had closed the door of the attic room behind them
	there's something i haven't told you, harry said
	on saturday morning, i woke up with my scar hurting again
	ron's and hermione's reactions were almost exactly as harry had imagined them back in his bedroom on privet drive
	hermione gasped and started making suggestions at once, mentioning a number of reference books, and everybody from albus dumbledore to madam pomfrey, the hogwarts nurse
	ron simply looked dumbstruck
	but  he wasn't there, was he  youknowwho  i mean  last time your scar kept hurting, he was at hogwarts, wasn't hei'm sure he wasn't on privet drive, said harry
	but i was dreaming about him
	him and peter  you know, wormtail
	i can't remember all of it now, but they were plotting to kill
	he had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying me, but couldn't bring himself to make hermione look any more horrified than she already did
	it was only a dream, said ron bracingly
	yeah, but was it, though said harry, turning to look out of the window at the brightening sky
	it's weird, isn't it
	my scar hurts, and three days later the death eaters are on the march, and voldemort's sign's up in the sky again
	don't  say  his  name  ron hissed through gritted teeth
	and remember what professor trelawney said  harry went on, ignoring ron
	at the end of last yearprofessor trelawney was their divination teacher at hogwarts
	hermione's terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort
	oh harry, you aren't going to pay attention to anything that old fraud saysyou weren't there, said harry
	this time was different
	i told you, she went into a trance  a real one
	and she said the dark lord would rise again
	greater and more terrible than ever before
	and he'd manage it because his servant was going to go back to him
	and that night wormtail escaped
	there was a silence in which ron fidgeted absentmindedly with a hole in his chudley cannons bedspread
	why were you asking if hedwig had come, harry  hermione asked
	are you expecting a letteri told sirius about my scar, said harry, shrugging
	i'm waiting for his answer
	good thinking said ron, his expression clearing
	i bet sirius'll know what to doi hoped he'd get back to me quickly, said harry
	but we don't know where sirius is
	he could be in africa or somewhere, couldn't he said hermione reasonably
	hedwig's not going to manage that journey in a few days
	yeah, i know, said harry, but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as he looked out of the window at the hedwigfree sky
	come and have a game of quidditch in the orchard, harry said ron
	come on  three on three, bill and charlie and fred and george will play
	you can try out the wronski feint
	ron, said hermione, in an idon'tthinkyou'rebeingverysensitive sort of voice, harry doesn't want to play quidditch right now
	he's worried, and he's tired
	we all need to go to bed
	yeah, i want to play quidditch, said harry suddenly
	hang on, i'll get my firebolt
	hermione left the room, muttering something that sounded very much like boys
	weasley nor percy was at home much over the following week
	both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up, and returned well after dinner every night
	it's been an absolute uproar, percy told them importantly the sunday evening before they were due to return to hogwarts
	i've been putting out fires all week
	people keep sending howlers, and of course, if you don't open a howler straight away, it explodes
	scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to cinders
	why are they all sending howlers  asked ginny, who was mending her copy of one thousand magical herbs and fungi with spellotape on the rug in front of the living room fire
	complaining about security at the world cup, said percy
	they want compensation for their ruined property
	mundungus fletcher's put in a claim for a twelvebedroomed tent with ensuite jacuzzi, but i've got his number
	i know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks
	weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner
	harry liked this clock
	it was completely useless if you wanted to know the time, but otherwise very informative
	it had nine golden hands, and each of them was engraved with one of the weasley family's names
	there were no numerals around the face, but descriptions of where each family member might be
	home, school, and work were there, but there was also traveling, lost, hospital, prison, and, in the position where the number twelve would be on a normal clock, mortal peril
	eight of the hands were currently pointing to the home position, but mr
	weasley's, which was the longest, was still pointing to work
	your father hasn't had to go into the office on weekends since the days of youknowwho, she said
	they're working him far too hard
	his dinner's going to be ruined if he doesn't come home soon
	well, father feels he's got to make up for his mistake at the match, doesn't he said percy
	if truth be told, he was a tad unwise to make a public statement without clearing it with his head of department first don't you dare blame your father for what that wretched skeeter woman wrote  said mrs
	weasley, flaring up at once
	if dad hadn't said anything, old rita would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from the ministry had commented, said bill, who was playing chess with ron
	rita skeeter never makes anyone look good
	remember, she interviewed all the gringotts' charm breakers once, and called me 'a longhaired pillock'well, it is a bit long, dear, said mrs
	if you'd just let me no, mum
	rain lashed against the living room window
	hermione was immersed in the standard book of spells, grade 4, copies of which mrs
	weasley had bought for her, harry, and ron in diagon alley
	charlie was darning a fireproof balaclava
	harry was polishing his firebolt, the broomstick servicing kit hermione had given him for his thirteenth birthday open at his feet
	fred and george were sitting in a far corner, quills out, talking in whispers, their heads bent over a piece of parchment
	what are you two up to said mrs
	weasley sharply, her eyes on the twins
	homework, said fred vaguely
	don't be ridiculous, you're still on holiday, said mrs
	yeah, we've left it a bit late, said george
	you're not by any chance writing out a new order form, are you said mrs
	you wouldn't be thinking of restarting weasleys' wizard wheezes, by any chancenow, mum, said fred, looking up at her, a pained look on his face
	if the hogwarts express crashed tomorrow, and george and i died, how would you feel to know that the last thing we ever heard from you was an unfounded accusationeveryone laughed, even mrs
	oh your father's coming  she said suddenly, looking up at the clock again
	weasley's hand had suddenly spun from work to traveling a second later it had shuddered to a halt on home with the others, and they heard him calling from the kitchen
	coming, arthur called mrs
	weasley, hurrying out of the room
	a few moments later, mr
	weasley came into the warm living room carrying his dinner on a tray
	he looked completely exhausted
	well, the fat's really in the fire now, he told mrs
	weasley as he sat down in an armchair near the hearth and toyed unenthusiastically with his somewhat shriveled cauliflower
	rita skeeter's been ferreting around all week, looking for more ministry messups to report
	and now she's found out about poor old bertha going missing, so that'll be the headline in the prophet tomorrow
	i told bagman he should have sent someone to look for her ages ago
	crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks, said percy swiftly
	crouch is very lucky rita hasn't found out about winky, said mr
	there'd be a week's worth of headlines in his houseelf being caught holding the wand that conjured the dark mark
	i thought we were all agreed that that elf, while irresponsible, did not conjure the mark  said percy hotly
	crouch is very lucky no one at the daily prophet knows how mean he is to elves said hermione angrily
	now look here, hermione said percy
	a highranking ministry official like mr
	crouch deserves unswerving obedience from his servants  his slave, you mean  said hermione, her voice rising passionately, because he didn't pay winky, did hei think you'd all better go upstairs and check that you've packed properly said mrs
	weasley, breaking up the argument
	come on now, all of you
	harry repacked his broomstick servicing kit, put his firebolt over his shoulder, and went back upstairs with ron
	the rain sounded even louder at the top of the house, accompanied by loud whistlings and moans from the wind, not to mention sporadic howls from the ghoul who lived in the attic
	pigwidgeon began twittering and zooming around his cage when they entered
	the sight of the halfpacked trunks seemed to have sent him into a frenzy of excitement
	bung him some owl treats, said ron, throwing a packet across to harry
	it might shut him up
	harry poked a few owl treats through the bars of pigwidgeon's cage, then turned to his trunk
	hedwig's cage stood next to it, still empty
	it's been over a week, harry said, looking at hedwig's deserted perch
	ron, you don't reckon sirius has been caught, do younah, it would've been in the daily prophet, said ron
	the ministry would want to show they'd caught someone, wouldn't theyyeah, i suppose
	look, here's the stuff mum got for you in diagon alley
	and she's got some gold out of your vault for you
	and she's washed all your socks
	he heaved a pile of parcels onto harry's camp bed and dropped the money bag and a load of socks next to it
	harry started unwrapping the shopping
	apart from the standard book of spells, grade 4, by miranda goshawk, he had a handful of new quills, a dozen rolls of parchment, and refills for his potionmaking kit  he had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna
	he was just piling underwear into his cauldron when ron made a loud noise of disgust behind him
	what is that supposed to behe was holding up something that looked to harry like a long, maroon velvet dress
	it had a moldylooking lace frill at the collar and matching lace cuffs
	there was a knock on the door, and mrs
	weasley entered, carrying an armful of freshly laundered hogwarts robes
	here you are, she said, sorting them into two piles
	now, mind you pack them properly so they don't crease
	mum, you've given me ginny's new dress, said ron, handing it out to her
	of course i haven't, said mrs
	what said ron, looking horrorstruck
	dress robes repeated mrs
	it says on your school list that you're supposed to have dress robes this year
	robes for formal occasions
	you've got to be kidding, said ron in disbelief
	i'm not wearing that, no way
	everyone wears them, ron said mrs
	they're all like that your father's got some for smart partiesi'll go starkers before i put that on, said ron stubbornly
	don't be so silly, said mrs
	you've got to have dress robes, they're on your list  i got some for harry too
	in some trepidation, harry opened the last parcel on his camp bed
	it wasn't as bad as he had expected, however his dress robes didn't have any lace on them at all  in fact, they were more or less the same as his school ones, except that they were bottle green instead of black
	i thought they'd bring out the color of your eyes, dear, said mrs
	well, they're okay said ron angrily, looking at harry's robes
	why couldn't i have some like thatbecause
	well, i had to get yours secondhand, and there wasn't a lot of choice said mrs
	he would willingly have split all the money in his gringotts vault with the weasleys, but he knew they would never take it
	i'm never wearing them, ron was saying stubbornly
	and, harry, make sure you get a picture of him
	goodness knows i could do with a laugh
	she left the room, slamming the door behind her
	there was a funny spluttering noise from behind them
	pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge owl treat
	why is everything i own rubbish said ron furiously, striding across the room to unstick pigwidgeon's beak
	chapter eleven  aboard the hogwart expressthere was a definite endoftheholidays gloom in the air when harry awoke next morning
	heavy rain was still splattering against the window as he got dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt they would change into their school robes on the hogwarts express
	he, ron, fred, and george had just reached the firstfloor landing on their way down to breakfast, when mrs
	weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs, looking harassed
	arthur  she called up the staircase
	arthur  urgent message from the ministryharry flattened himself against the wall as mr
	weasley came clattering past with his robes on backtofront and hurtled out of sight
	when harry and the others entered the kitchen, they saw mrs
	weasley rummaging anxiously in the drawers  i've got a quill here somewhere  and mr
	weasley bending over the fire, talking to harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they were working properly
	amos diggory's head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large, bearded egg
	it was talking very fast, completely unperturbed by the sparks flying around it and the flames licking its ears
	muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting, so they went and called those whatd'youcall'ems  pleasemen
	arthur, you've got to get over there here said mrs
	weasley breathlessly, pushing a piece of parchment, a bottle of ink, and a crumpled quill into mr
	it's a real stroke of luck i heard about it, said mr
	i had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls, and i found the improper use of magic lot all setting off  if rita skeeter gets hold of this one, arthur what does madeye say happened  asked mr
	weasley, unscrewing the ink bottle, loading up his quill, and preparing to take notes
	diggory's head rolled its eyes
	says he heard an intruder in his yard
	says he was creeping toward the house, but was ambushed by his dustbins
	what did the dustbins do asked mr
	weasley, scribbling frantically
	made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere, as far as i can tell, said mr
	apparently one of them was still rocketing around when the pleasemen turned up mr
	and what about the intruderarthur, you know madeye, said mr
	diggory's head, rolling its eyes again
	someone creeping into his yard in the dead of night  more likely there's a very shellshocked cat wandering around somewhere, covered in potato peelings
	but if the improper use of magic lot get their hands on madeye, he's had it  think of his record  we've got to get him off on a minor charge, something in your department  what are exploding dustbins worthmight be a caution, said mr
	weasley, still writing very fast, his brow furrowed
	madeye didn't use his wand  he didn't actually attack anyonei'll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach through the window, said mr
	diggory, but they'll have a job proving it, there aren't any casualties
	all right, i'm off, mr
	weasley said, and he stuffed the parchment with his notes on it into his pocket and dashed out of the kitchen again
	diggory's head looked around at mrs
	sorry about this, molly, it said, more calmly, bothering you so early and everything
	but arthur's the only one who can get madeye off, and madeye's supposed to be starting his new job today
	why he had to choose last night
	never mind, amos, said mrs
	sure you won't have a bit of toast or anything before you gooh go on, then, said mr
	weasley took a piece of buttered toast from a stack on the kitchen table, put it into the fire tongs, and transferred it into mr
	fanks, he said in a muffled voice, and then, with a small pop, vanished
	weasley calling hurried goodbyes to bill, charlie, percy,  and the girls
	within five minutes, he was back in the kitchen, his robes on the right way now, dragging a comb through his hair
	i'd better hurry  you have a good term, boys, said mr
	weasley to harry, ron, and the twins, fastening a cloak over his shoulders and preparing to disapparate
	molly, are you going to be all right taking the kids to king's crossof course i will, she said
	you just look after madeye, we'll be fine
	weasley vanished, bill and charlie entered the kitchen
	did someone say madeye bill asked
	what's he been up to now
	he says someone tried to break into his house last night, said mrs
	madeye moody said george thoughtfully, spreading marmalade on his toast
	isn't he that nutter your father thinks very highly of madeye moody, said mrs
	yeah, well, dad collects plugs, doesn't he  said fred quietly as mrs
	weasley left the room
	moody was a great wizard in his time, said bill
	he's an old friend of dumbledore's, isn't he said charlie
	dumbledore's not what you'd call normal, though, is he  said fred
	i mean, i know he's a genius and everything
	who is madeye asked harry
	he's retired, used to work at the ministry, said charlie
	i met him once when dad took me into work with him
	he was an auror  one of the best
	a dark wizard catcher, he added, seeing harry's blank look half the cells in azkaban are full because of him
	he made himself loads of enemies, though
	the families of people he caught, mainly
	and i heard he's been getting really paranoid in his old age
	doesn't trust anyone anymore
	sees dark wizards everywhere
	bill and charlie decided to come and see everyone off at king's cross station, but percy, apologizing most profusely, said that he really needed to get to work
	i just can't justify taking more time off at the moment, he told them
	crouch is really starting to rely on me
	yeah, you know what, percy  said george seriously
	i reckon he'll know your name soon
	weasley had braved the telephone in the village post office to order three ordinary muggle taxis to take them into london
	arthur tried to borrow ministry cars for us, mrs
	weasley whispered to harry as they stood in the rainwashed yard, watching the taxi drivers heaving six heavy hogwarts trunks into their cars
	but there weren't any to spare
	oh dear, they don't look happy, do theyharry didn't like to tell mrs
	weasley that muggle taxi drivers rarely transported overexcited owls, and pigwidgeon was making an earsplitting racket
	nor did it help that a number of filibuster's fabulous noheat, wetstart fireworks went off unexpectedly when fred's trunk sprang open, causing the driver carrying it to yell with fright and pain as crookshanks clawed his way up the man's leg
	the journey was uncomfortable, owing to the fact that they were jammed in the back of the taxis with their trunks
	crookshanks took quite a while to recover from the fireworks, and by the time they entered london, harry, ron, and hermione were all severely scratched
	they were very relieved to get out at king's cross, even though the rain was coming down harder than ever, and they got soaked carrying their trunks across the busy road and into the station
	harry was used to getting onto platform nine and threequarters by now
	it was a simple matter of walking straight through the apparently solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten
	the only tricky part was doing this in an unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting muggle attention
	they did it in groups today harry, ron, and hermione the most conspicuous, since they were accompanied by pigwidgeon and crookshanks went first they leaned casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways through it
	and as they did so, platform nine and threequarters materialized in front of them
	the hogwarts express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there, clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many hogwarts students and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts
	pigwidgeon became noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist
	harry, ron, and hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their luggage in a compartment halfway along the train
	they then hopped back down onto the platform to say goodbye to mrs
	weasley, bill, and charlie
	i might be seeing you all sooner than you think, said charlie, grinning, as he hugged ginny goodbye
	you'll see, said charlie
	just don't tell percy i mentioned it
	it's 'classified information, until such time as the ministry sees fit to release it,' after all
	yeah, i sort of wish i were back at hogwarts this year, said bill, hands in his pockets, looking almost wistfully at the train
	why  said george impatiently
	you're going to have an interesting year, said bill, his eyes twinkling
	i might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it
	a bit of what said ron
	but at that moment, the whistle blew, and mrs
	weasley chivvied them toward the train doors
	thanks for having us to stay, mrs
	weasley, said hermione as they climbed on board, closed the door, and leaned out of the window to talk to her
	yeah, thanks for everything, mrs
	oh it was my pleasure, dears, said mrs
	i'd invite you for christmas, but
	well, i expect you're all going to want to stay at hogwarts, what with
	one thing and another
	mum said ron irritably
	what d'you three know that we don'tyou'll find out this evening, i expect, said mrs
	it's going to be very exciting  mind you, i'm very glad they've changed the rules what rules  said harry, ron, fred, and george together
	i'm sure professor dumbledore will tell you
	now, behave, won't you  won't you, fred  and you, georgethe pistons hissed loudly and the train began to move
	tell us what's happening at hogwarts  fred bellowed out of the window as mrs
	weasley, bill, and charlie sped away from them
	what rules are they changing but mrs
	weasley only smiled and waved
	before the train had rounded the corner, she, bill, and charlie had disapparated
	harry, ron, and hermione went back to their compartment
	the thick rain splattering the windows made it very difficult to see out of them
	ron undid his trunk, pulled out his maroon dress robes, and flung them over pigwidgeon's cage to muffle his hooting
	bagman wanted to tell us what's happening at hogwarts, he said grumpily, sitting down next to harry
	at the world cup, remember  but my own mother won't say
	wonder what shh  hermione whispered suddenly, pressing her finger to her lips and pointing toward the compartment next to theirs
	harry and ron listened, and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door
	father actually considered sending me to durmstrang rather than hogwarts, you know
	he knows the headmaster, you see
	well, you know his opinion of dumbledore  the man's such a mudbloodlover  and durmstrang doesn't admit that sort of riffraff
	but mother didn't like the idea of me going to school so far away
	father says durmstrang takes a far more sensible line than hogwarts about the dark arts
	durmstrang students actually learn them, not just the defense rubbish we do
	hermione got up, tiptoed to the compartment door, and slid it shut, blocking out malfoy's voice
	so he thinks durmstrang would have suited him, does he  she said angrily
	i wish he had gone, then we wouldn't have to put up with him
	durmstrang's another wizarding school said harry
	yes, said hermione sniffily, and it's got a horrible reputation
	according to an appraisal ofmagical education in europe, it puts a lot of emphasis on the dark arts
	i think i've heard of it, said ron vaguely
	where is it  what countrywell, nobody knows, do they  said hermione, raising her eyebrows
	er  why not said harry
	there's traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools
	durmstrang and beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal their secrets, said hermione matteroffactly
	come off it, said ron, starting to laugh
	durmstrang's got to be about the same size as hogwarts  how are you going to hide a great big castlebut hogwarts is hidden, said hermione, in surprise
	everyone knows that
	well, everyone who's read hogwarts, a history, anyway
	just you, then, said ron
	so go on  how d'you hide a place like hogwartsit's bewitched, said hermione
	if a muggle looks at it, all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying danger, do not enter, unsafe
	so durmstrang'll just look like a ruin to an outsider toomaybe, said hermione, shrugging, or it might have mugglerepelling charms on it, like the world cup stadium
	and to keep foreign wizards from finding it, they'll have made it unplottable come again well, you can enchant a building so it's impossible to plot on a map, can't youer
	if you say so, said harry
	but i think durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north, said hermione thoughtfully
	somewhere very cold, because they've got fur capes as part of their uniforms
	ah, think of the possibilities, said ron dreamily
	it would've been so easy to push malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an accident
	shame his mother likes him
	the rain became heavier and heavier as the train moved farther north
	the sky was so dark and the windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by midday
	the lunch trolley came rattling along the corridor, and harry bought a large stack of cauldron cakes for them to share
	several of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon progressed, including seamus finnigan, dean thomas, and neville longbottom, a roundfaced, extremely forgetful boy who had been brought up by his formidable witch of a grandmother
	seamus was still wearing his ireland rosette
	some of its magic seemed to be wearing off now it was still squeaking  troy  mullet  moran  but in a very feeble and exhausted sort of way
	after half an hour or so, hermione, growing tired of the endless quidditch talk, buried herself once more in the standard book of spells, grade 4, and started trying to learn a summoning charm
	neville listened jealously to the others' conversation as they relived the cup match
	gran didn't want to go, he said miserably
	wouldn't buy tickets
	it sounded amazing though
	look at this, neville
	he rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and pulled out the miniature figure of viktor krum
	oh wow, said neville enviously as ron tipped krum onto his pudgy hand
	we saw him right up close, as well, said ron
	we were in the top box for the first and last time in your life, weasley
	draco malfoy had appeared in the doorway
	behind him stood crabbe and goyle, his enormous, thuggish cronies, both of whom appeared to have grown at least a foot during the summer
	evidently they had overheard the conversation through the compartment door, which dean and seamus had left ajar
	don't remember asking you to join us, malfoy, said harry coolly
	what is that said malfoy, pointing at pigwidgeon's cage
	a sleeve of ron's dress robes was dangling from it, swaying with the motion of the train, the moldy lace cuff very obvious
	ron made to stuff the robes out of sight, but malfoy was too quick for him he seized the sleeve and pulled
	look at this said malfoy in ecstasy, holding up ron's robes and showing crabbe and goyle, weasley, you weren't thinking of wearing these, were you i mean  they were very fashionable in about eighteen ninety
	eat dung, malfoy said ron, the same color as the dress robes as he snatched them back out of malfoy's grip
	malfoy howled with derisive laughter crabbe and goyle guffawed stupidly
	going to enter, weasley  going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name  there's money involved as well, you know
	you'd be able to afford some decent robes if you won
	what are you talking about snapped ron
	'are you going to enter'  malfoy repeated
	i suppose you will, potter  you never miss a chance to show off, do youeither explain what you're on about or go away, malfoy, said hermione testily, over the top of the standard book of spells, grade 4
	a gleeful smile spread across malfoy's pale facedon't tell me you don't know he said delightedly
	you've got a father and brother at the ministry and you don't even know  my god, my father told me about it ages ago
	heard it from cornelius fudge
	but then, father's always associated with the top people at the ministry
	maybe your father's too junior to know about it, weasley
	they probably don't talk about important stuff in front of him
	laughing once more, malfoy beckoned to crabbe and goyle, and the three of them disappeared
	ron got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door so hard behind them that the glass shattered
	ron said hermione reproachfully, and she pulled out her wand, muttered reparo and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the door
	making it look like he knows everything and we don't
	father's always associated with the top peopie at the ministry
	dad could've got a promotion any time
	he just likes it where he is
	of course he does, said hermione quietly
	don't let malfoy get to you, ron  him get to me  as if  said ron, picking up one of the remaining cauldron cakes and squashing it into a pulp
	ron's bad mood continued for the rest of the journey
	he didn't talk much as they changed into their school robes, and was still glowering when the hogwarts express slowed down at last and finally stopped in the pitchdarkness of hogsmeade station
	as the train doors opened, there was a rumble of thunder overhead
	hermione bundled up crookshanks in her cloak and ron left his dress robes over pigwidgeon as they left the train, heads bent and eyes narrowed against the downpour
	the rain was now coming down so thick and fast that it was as though buckets of icecold water were being emptied repeatedly over their heads
	hi, hagrid  harry yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the platform
	all righ', harry  hagrid bellowed back, waving
	see yeh at the feast if we don' drownfirst years traditionally reached hogwarts castle by sailing across the lake with hagrid
	oooh, i wouldn't fancy crossing the lake in this weather, said hermione fervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the rest of the crowd
	a hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them outside the station
	harry, ron, hermione, and neville climbed gratefully into one of them, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great lurch, the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the track toward hogwarts castle
	chapter twelve  the triwizard tournamentthrough the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and up the sweeping drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what was fast becoming a gale
	leaning against the window, harry could see hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering behind the thick curtain of rain
	lightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors, which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps
	people who had occupied the carriages in front were already hurrying up the stone steps into the castle
	harry, ron, hermione, and neville jumped down from their carriage and dashed up the steps too, looking up only when they were safely inside the cavernous, torchlit entrance hall, with its magnificent marble staircase
	blimey, said ron, shaking his head and sending water everywhere, if that keeps up the lake's going to overflow
	i'm soak  arrgh a large, red, waterfilled balloon had dropped from out of the ceiling onto ron's head and exploded
	drenched and sputtering, ron staggered sideways into harry, just as a second water bomb dropped  narrowly missing hermione, it burst at harry's feet, sending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into his socks
	people all around them shrieked and started pushing one another in their efforts to get out of the line of fire
	harry looked up and saw, floating twenty feet above them, peeves the poltergeist, a little man in a bellcovered hat and orange bow tie, his wide, malicious face contorted with concentration as he took aim again
	peeves  yelled an angry voice
	peeves, come down here at onceprofessor mcgonagall, deputy headmistress and head of gryffindor house, had come dashing out of the great hall she skidded on the wet floor and grabbed hermione around the neck to stop herself from falling
	ouch  sorry, miss granger that's all right, professor  hermione gasped, massaging her throat
	peeves, get down here now barked professor mcgonagall, straightening her pointed hat and glaring upward through her squarerimmed spectacles
	not doing nothing  cackled peeves, lobbing a water bomb at several fifthyear girls, who screamed and dived into the great hall
	already wet, aren't they  little squirts  wheeeeeeeeee  and he aimed another bomb at a group of second years who had just arrived
	i shall call the headmaster shouted professor mcgonagall
	i'm warning you, peeves peeves stuck out his tongue, threw the last of his water bombs into the air, and zoomed off up the marble staircase, cackling insanely
	well, move along, then  said professor mcgonagall sharply to the bedraggled crowd
	into the great hall, come onharry, ron, and hermione slipped and slid across the entrance hall and through the double doors on the right, ron muttering furiously under his breath as he pushed his sopping hair off his face
	the great hall looked its usual splendid self, decorated for the startofterm feast
	golden plates and goblets gleamed by the light of hundreds and hundreds of candles, floating over the tables in midair
	the four long house tables were packed with chattering students at the top of the hall, the staff sat along one side of a fifth table, facing their pupils
	it was much warmer in here
	harry, ron, and hermione walked past the slytherins, the ravenclaws, and the hufflepuffs, and sat down with the rest of the gryffindors at the far side of the hall, next to nearly headless nick, the gryffindor ghost
	pearly white and semitransparent, nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet, but with a particularly large ruff, which served the dual purpose of looking extrafestive, and insuring that his head didn't wobble too much on his partially severed neck
	good evening, he said, beaming at them
	says who  said harry, taking off his sneakers and emptying them of water
	hope they hurry up with the sorting
	the sorting of the new students into houses took place at the start of every school year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances, harry hadn't been present at one since his own
	he was quite looking forward to it
	just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table
	hiya, harryit was colin creevey, a third year to whom harry was something of a hero
	hi, colin, said harry warily
	harry, guess what  guess what, harry  my brother's starting  my brother denniser  good, said harry
	he's really excited  said colin, practically bouncing up and down in his seat
	i just hope he's in gryffindor  keep your fingers crossed, eh, harryer  yeah, all right, said harry
	he turned back to hermione, ron, and nearly headless nick
	brothers and sisters usually go in the same houses, don't they  he said
	he was judging by the weasleys, all seven of whom had been put into gryffindor
	oh no, not necessarily, said hermione
	parvati patil's twin's in ravenclaw, and they're identical
	you'd think they'd be together, wouldn't youharry looked up at the staff table
	there seemed to be rather more empty seats there than usual
	hagrid, of course, was still fighting his way across the lake with the first years professor mcgonagall was presumably supervising the drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too, and harry couldn't think who else was missing
	where's the new defense against the dark arts teacher  said hermione, who was also looking up at the teachers
	they had never yet had a defense against the dark arts teacher who had lasted more than three terms
	harry's favorite by far had been professor lupin, who had resigned last year
	he looked up and down the staff table
	there was definitely no new face there
	maybe they couldn't get anyone  said hermione, looking anxious
	harry scanned the table more carefully
	tiny little professor flitwick, the charms teacher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside professor sprout, the herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray hair
	she was talking to professor sinistra of the astronomy department
	on professor sinistra's other side was the sallowfaced, hooknosed, greasyhaired potions master, snape  harry's least favorite person at hogwarts
	harry's loathing of snape was matched only by snape's hatred of him, a hatred which had, if possible, intensified last year, when harry had helped sirius escape right under snape's overlarge nose  snape and sirius had been enemies since their own school days
	on snape's other side was an empty seat, which harry guessed was professor mcgonagall's
	next to it, and in the very center of the table, sat professor dumbledore, the headmaster, his sweeping silver hair and beard shining in the candlelight, his magnificent deep green robes embroidered with many stars and moons
	the tips of dumbledore's long, thin fingers were together and he was resting his chin upon them, staring up at the ceiling through his halfmoon spectacles as though lost in thought
	harry glanced up at the ceiling too
	it was enchanted to look like the sky outside, and he had never seen it look this stormy
	black and purple clouds were swirling across it, and as another thunderclap sounded outside, a fork of lightning flashed across it
	oh hurry up, ron moaned, beside harry, i could eat a hippogriff
	the words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the great hall opened and silence fell
	professor mcgonagall was leading a long line of first years up to the top of the hall
	if harry, ron, and hermione were wet, it was nothing to how these first years looked
	they appeared to have swum across the lake rather than sailed
	all of them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school  all of them except the smallest of the lot, a boy with mousy hair, who was wrapped in what harry recognized as hagrid's moleskin overcoat
	the coat was so big for him that it hooked as though he were draped in a furry black circus tent
	his small face protruded from over the collar, looking almost painfully excited
	when he had lined up with his terrifiedlooking peers, he caught colin creevey's eye, gave a double thumbsup, and mouthed, i fell in the lake  he looked positively delighted about it
	professor mcgonagall now placed a threelegged stool on the ground before the first years and, on top of it, an extremely old, dirty patched wizard's hat
	the first years stared at it
	so did everyone else
	for a moment, there was silence
	then a long tear near the brim opened wide like a mouth, and the hat broke into songa thousand years or more ago,when i was newly sewn,there lived four wizards of renown,whose names are still well knownbold gryffindor, from wild moor,fair ravenclaw, from glen,sweet hufflepuff, from valley broad,shrewd slytherin, from fin
	they shared a wish, a hope, a dream,they hatched a daring planto educate young sorcerersthus hogwarts school began
	now each of these four foundersformed their own house, for eachdid value different virtuesin the ones they had to teach
	by gryffindor, the bravest wereprized far beyond the restfor ravenclaw, the cleverestwould always be the bestfor hufflepuff,  hard workers weremost worthy of admissionand powerhungry slytherinloved those of great ambition
	while still alive they did dividetheir favorites from the throng,yet how to pick the worthy oneswhen they were dead and gone'twas gryffindor who found the way,he whipped me off his headthe founders put some brains in meso i could choose insteadnow slip me snug about your ears,i've never yet been wrong,i'll have a look inside your mindand tell where you belong the great hall rang with applause as the sorting hat finished
	that's not the song it sang when it sorted us, said harry, clapping along with everyone else
	sings a different one every year, said ron
	it's got to be a pretty boring life, hasn't it, being a hat  i suppose it spends all year making up the next one
	professor mcgonagall was now unrolling a large scroll of parchment
	when i call out your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool, she told the first years
	when the hat announces your house, you will go and sit at the appropriate table
	ackerley, stewarta boy walked forward, visibly trembling from head to foot, picked up the sorting hat, put it on, and sat down on the stool
	ravenclaw shouted the hat
	stewart ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the ravenclaw table, where everyone was applauding him
	harry caught a glimpse of cho, the ravenclaw seeker, cheering stewart ackerley as he sat down
	for a fleeting second, harry had a strange desire to join the ravenclaw table too
	baddock, malcolmslytherinthe table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers harry could see malfoy clapping as baddock joined the slytherins
	harry wondered whether baddock knew that slytherin house had turned out more dark witches and wizards than any other
	fred and george hissed malcolm baddock as he sat down
	branstone, eleanorhufflepuff cauldwell, owenhufflepuffcreevey, dennistiny dennis creevey staggered forward, tripping over hagrid's moleskin, just as hagrid himself sidled into the hall through a door behind the teachers' table
	about twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad, hagrid, with his long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming  a misleading impression, for harry, ron, and hermione knew hagrid to possess a very kind nature
	he winked at them as he sat down at the end of the staff table and watched dennis creevey putting on the sorting hat
	the rip at the brim opened wide  gryffindor the hat shouted
	hagrid clapped along with the gryffindors as dennis creevey, beaming widely, took off the hat, placed it back on the stool, and hurried over to join his brother
	colin, i fell in  he said shrilly, throwing himself into an empty seat
	it was brilliant and something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boatcool said colin, just as excitedly
	it was probably the giant squid, denniswow said dennis, as though nobody in their wildest dreams could hope for more than being thrown into a stormtossed, fathomsdeep lake, and pushed out of it again by a giant sea monster
	dennis  dennis  see that boy down there  the one with the black hair and glasses see him  know who he is, dennisharry looked away, staring very hard at the sorting hat, now sorting emma dobbs
	the sorting continued boys and girls with varying degrees of fright on their faces moving one by one to the threelegged stool, the line dwindling slowly as professor mcgonagall passed the l's
	oh hurry up, ron moaned, massaging his stomach
	now, ron, the sorting's much more important than food, said nearly headless nick as madley, laura  became a hufflepuff
	course it is, if you're dead, snapped ron
	i do hope this year's batch of gryffindors are up to scratch, said nearly headless nick, applauding as mcdonald, natalie  joined the gryffindor table
	we don't want to break our winning streak, do wegryffindor had won the interhouse championship for the last three years in a row
	pritchard, grahamslytherinquirke, orlaravenclawand finally, with whitby, kevin hufflepuff, the sorting ended
	professor mcgonagall picked up the hat and the stool and carried them away
	about time, said ron, seizing his knife and fork and looking expectantly at his golden plate
	professor dumbledore had gotten to his feet
	he was smiling around at the students, his arms opened wide in welcome
	i have only two words to say to you, he told them, his deep voice echoing around the hall
	hear, hear said harry and ron loudly as the empty dishes filled magically before their eyes
	nearly headless nick watched mournfully as harry, ron, and hermione loaded their own plates
	aaah, 'at's be'er, said ron, with his mouth full of mashed potato
	you're lucky there's a feast at all tonight, you know, said nearly headless nick
	there was trouble in the kitchens earlier
	why  wha' 'appened said harry, through a sizable chunk of steak
	peeves, of course, said nearly headless nick, shaking his head, which wobbled dangerously
	he pulled his ruff a little higher up on his neck
	the usual argument, you know
	he wanted to attend the feast  well, it's quite out of the question, you know what he's like, utterly uncivilized, can't see a plate of food without throwing it
	we held a ghost's council  the fat friar was all for giving him the chance  but most wisely, in my opinion, the bloody baron put his foot down
	the bloody baron was the slytherin ghost, a gaunt and silent specter covered in silver bloodstains
	he was the only person at hogwarts who could really control peeves
	yeah, we thought peeves seemed hacked off about something, said ron darkly
	so what did he do in the kitchensoh the usual, said nearly headless nick, shrugging
	wreaked havoc and mayhem
	pots and pans everywhere
	place swimming in soup
	terrified the houseelves out of their witsclang
	hermione had knocked over her golden goblet
	pumpkin juice spread steadily over the tablecloth, staining several feet of white linen orange, but hermione paid no attention
	there are houseelves here she said, staring, horrorstruck, at nearly headless nick
	here at hogwartscertainly, said nearly headless nick, looking surprised at her reaction
	the largest number in any dwelling in britain, i believe
	i've never seen one  said hermione
	well, they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day, do they  said nearly headless nick
	they come out at night to do a bit of cleaning
	see to the fires and so on
	i mean, you're not supposed to see them, are you  that's the mark of a good houseelf, isn't it, that you don't know it's therehermione stared at him
	but they get paid she said
	they get holidays, don't they  and  and sick leave, and pensions, and everythingnearly headless nick chortled so much that his ruff slipped and his head flopped off, dangling on the inch or so of ghostly skin and muscle that still attached it to his neck
	sick leave and pensions he said, pushing his head back onto his shoulders and securing it once more with his ruff
	houseelves don't want sick leave and pensionshermione looked down at her hardly touched plate of food, then put her knife and fork down upon it and pushed it away from her
	oh c'mon, 'ermyknee, said ron, accidentally spraying harry with bits of yorkshire pudding
	oops  sorry, 'arry   he swallowed
	you won't get them sick leave by starving yourselfslave labor, said hermione, breathing hard through her nose
	that's what made this dinner
	and she refused to eat another bite
	the rain was still drumming heavily against the high, dark glass
	another clap of thunder shook the windows, and the stormy ceiling flashed, illuminating the golden plates as the remains of the first course vanished and were replaced, instantly, with puddings
	treacle tart, hermione  said ron, deliberately wafting its smell toward her
	spotted dick, look  chocolate gateaubut hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of professor mcgonagall that he gave up
	when the puddings too had been demolished, and the last crumbs had faded off the plates, leaving them sparkling clean, albus dumbledore got to his feet again
	the buzz of chatter filling the hall ceased almost at once, so that only the howling wind and pounding rain could be heard
	so said dumbledore, smiling around at them all
	now that we are all fed and watered, hmph said hermione  i must once more ask for your attention, while i give out a few notices
	filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include screaming yoyos, fanged frisbees, and everbashing boomerangs
	the full list comprises some four hundred and thirtyseven items, i believe, and can be viewed in mr
	filch's office, if anybody would like to check it
	the corners of dumbledore's mouth twitched
	he continued, as ever, i would like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is outofbounds to students, as is the village of hogsmeade to all below third year
	it is also my painful duty to inform you that the interhouse quidditch cup will not take place this year
	he looked around at fred and george, his fellow members of the quidditch team
	they were mouthing soundlessly at dumbledore, apparently too appalled to speak
	dumbhedore went on, this is due to an event that will be starting in october, and continuing throughout the school year, taking up much of the teachers' time and energy  but i am sure you will all enjoy it immensely
	i have great pleasure in announcing that this year at hogwarts but at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the doors of the great hall banged open
	a man stood in the doorway, leaning upon a long staff, shrouded in a black traveling cloak
	every head in the great hall swiveled toward the stranger, suddenly brightly illuminated by a fork of lightning that flashed across the ceiling
	he lowered his hood, shook out a long mane of grizzled, dark gray hair, then began to walk up toward the teachers' table
	a dull clunk echoed through the hall on his every other step
	he reached the end of the top table, turned right, and limped heavily toward dumbledore
	another flash of lightning crossed the ceiling
	the lightning had thrown the man's face into sharp relief, and it was a face unlike any harry had ever seen
	it looked as though it had been carved out of weathered wood by someone who had only the vaguest idea of what human faces are supposed to look like, and was none too skilled with a chisel
	every inch of skin seemed to be scarred
	the mouth looked like a diagonal gash, and a large chunk of the nose was missing
	but it was the man's eyes that made him frightening
	one of them was small, dark, and beady
	the other was large, round as a coin, and a vivid, electric blue
	the blue eye was moving ceaselessly, without blinking, and was rolling up, down, and from side to side, quite independently of the normal eye  and then it rolled right over, pointing into the back of the man's head, so that all they could see was whiteness
	the stranger reached dumbledore
	he stretched out a hand that was as badly scarred as his face, and dumbhedore shook it, muttering words harry couldn't hear
	he seemed to be making some inquiry of the stranger, who shook his head unsmilingly and replied in an undertone
	dumbledore nodded and gestured the man to the empty seat on his righthand side
	the stranger sat down, shook his mane of dark gray hair out of his face, pulled a plate of sausages toward him, raised it to what was left of his nose, and sniffed it
	he then took a small knife out of his pocket, speared a sausage on the end of it, and began to eat
	his normal eye was fixed upon the sausages, but the blue eye was still darting restlessly around in its socket, taking in the hall and the students
	may i introduce our new defense against the dark arts teacher said dumbledore brightly into the silence
	it was usual for new staff members to be greeted with applause, but none of the staff or students chapped except dumbledore and hagrid, who both put their hands together and applauded, but the sound echoed dismally into the silence, and they stopped fairly quickly
	everyone else seemed too transfixed by moody's bizarre appearance to do more than stare at him
	moody  harry muttered to ron
	madeye moody  the one your dad went to help this morning must be, said ron in a low, awed voice
	what happened to him  hermione whispered
	what happened to his facedunno, ron whispered back, watching moody with fascination
	moody seemed totally indifferent to his lessthanwarm welcome
	ignoring the jug of pumpkin juice in front of him, he reached again into his traveling cloak, pulled out a hip flask, and took a long draught from it
	as he lifted his arm to drink, his cloak was pulled a few inches from the ground, and harry saw, below the table, several inches of carved wooden leg, ending in a clawed foot
	dumbledore cleared his throat
	as i was saying, he said, smiling at the sea of students before him, all of whom were still gazing transfixed at madeye moody, we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event that has not been held for over a century
	it is my very great pleasure to inform you that the triwizard tournament will be taking place at hogwarts this year
	you're joking said fred weasley loudly
	the tension that had filled the hall ever since moody's arrival suddenly broke
	nearly everyone laughed, and dumbledore chuckled appreciatively
	weasley, he said, though now that you mention it, i did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a leprechaun who all go into a bar
	professor mcgonagall cleared her throat loudly
	er  but maybe this is not the time
	said dumbledore, where was i  ah yes, the triwizard tournament
	well, some of you will not know what this tournament involves, so i hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely
	the triwizard tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest european schools of wizardry  hogwarts, beauxbatons, and durmstrang
	a champion was selected to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical tasks
	the schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years, and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities  until, that is, the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued
	death toll  hermione whispered, looking alarmed
	but her anxiety did not seem to be shared by the majority of students in the hall many of them were whispering excitedly to one another, and harry himself was far more interested in hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that had happened hundreds of years ago
	there have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the tournament, dumbledore continued, none of which has been very successful
	however, our own departments of international magical cooperation and magical games and sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt
	we have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger
	the heads of beauxbatons and durmstrang will be arriving with their shortlisted contenders in october, and the selection of the three champions will take place at halloween
	an impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the triwizard cup, the glory of their school, and a thousand galleons personal prize money
	i'm going for it fred weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches
	he was not the only person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the hogwarts champion
	at every house table, harry could see people either gazing raptly at dumbledore, or else whispering fervently to their neighbors
	but then dumbledore spoke again, and the hall quieted once more
	eager though i know all of you will be to bring the triwizard cup to hogwarts, he said, the heads of the participating schools, along with the ministry of magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year
	only students who are of age  that is to say, seventeen years or older  will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration
	this  dumbledore raised his voice slightly, for several people had made noises of outrage at these words, and the weasley twins were suddenly looking furious  is a measure we feel is necessary, given that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them
	i will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them hogwarts champion
	his light blue eyes twinkled as they flickered over fred's and george's mutinous faces
	i therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen
	the delegations from beauxbatons and durmstrang will be arriving in october and remaining with us for the greater part of this year
	i know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us, and will give your wholehearted support to the hogwarts champion when he or she is selected
	and now, it is late, and i know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning
	bedtime chop chopdumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to madeye moody
	there was a great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet and swarmed toward the double doors into the entrance hall
	they can't do that  said george weasley, who had not joined the crowd moving toward the door, but was standing up and glaring at dumbledore
	we're seventeen in april, why can't we have a shot they're not stopping me entering, said fred stubbornly, also scowling at the top table
	the champions'll get to do all sorts of stuff you'd never be allowed to do normally
	and a thousand galleons prize moneyyeah, said ron, a faraway look on his face
	yeah, a thousand galleons
	come on, said hermione, we'll be the only ones left here if you don't move
	harry, ron, hermione, fred, and george set off for the entrance hall, fred and george debating the ways in which dumbledore might stop those who were under seventeen from entering the tournament
	who's this impartial judge who's going to decide who the champions are  said harry
	dunno, said fred, but it's them we'll have to fool
	i reckon a couple of drops of aging potion might do it, george
	dumbledore knows you're not of age, though, said ron
	yeah, but he's not the one who decides who the champion is, is he  said fred shrewdly
	sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter, he'll choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are
	dumbledore's trying to stop us giving our names
	people have died, though  said hermione in a worried voice as they walked through a door concealed behind a tapestry and started up another, narrower staircase
	yeah, said fred airily, but that was years ago, wasn't it  anyway, where's the fun without a bit of risk  hey, ron, what if we find out how to get 'round dumbledore  fancy enteringwhat d'you reckon  ron asked harry
	be cool to enter, wouldn't it  but i s'pose they might want someone older
	dunno if we've learned enough
	i definitely haven't, came nevihle's gloomy voice from behind fred and george
	i expect my gran'd want me to try, though
	she's always going on about how i should be upholding the family honor
	i'll just have to  oops
	neville's foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the staircase
	there were many of these trick stairs at hogwarts it was second nature to most of the older students to jump this particular step, but neville's memory was notoriously poor
	harry and ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him out, while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked, laughing wheezily
	shut it, you, said ron, banging down its visor as they passed
	they made their way up to the entrance to gryffindor tower, which was concealed behind a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink silk dress
	password she said as they approached
	balderdash, said george, a prefect downstairs told me
	the portrait swung forward to reveal a hole in the wall through which they all climbed
	a crackling fire warmed the circular common room, which was full of squashy armchairs and tables
	hermione cast the merrily dancing flames a dark look, and harry distinctly heard her mutter  slave labor before bidding them good night and disappearing through the doorway to the girls' dormitory
	harry, ron, and neville climbed up the last, spiral staircase until they reached their own dormitory, which was situated at the top of the tower
	five fourposter beds with deep crimson hangings stood against the walls, each with its owner's trunk at the foot
	dean and seamus were already getting into bed seamus had pinned his ireland rosette to his headboard, and dean had tacked up a poster of viktor krum over his bedside table
	his old poster of the west ham football team was pinned right next to it
	mental, ron sighed, shaking his head at the completely stationary soccer players
	harry, ron, and neville got into their pajamas and into bed
	someone  a houseelf, no doubt  had placed warming pans between the sheets
	it was extremely comfortable, lying there in bed and listening to the storm raging outside
	i might go in for it, you know, ron said sleepily through the darkness, if fred and george find out how to
	you never know, do you s'pose not
	harry rolled over in bed, a series of dazzling new pictures forming in his mind's eye
	he had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was seventeen
	he had become hogwarts champion
	he was standing on the grounds, his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were applauding and screaming
	he had just won the triwizard tournament
	cho's face stood out particularly clearly in the blurred crowd, her face glowing with admiration
	harry grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad that ron couldn't see what he could
	chapter thirteen  madeye moodythe storm had blown itself out by the following morning, though the ceiling in the great hall was still gloomy heavy clouds of pewter gray swirled overhead as harry, ron, and hermione examined their new course schedules at breakfast
	a few seats along, fred, george, and lee jordan were discussing magical methods of aging themselves and bluffing their way into the triwizard tournament
	outside all morning, said ron, who was running his finger down the monday column of his schedule
	herbology with the hufflepuffs and care of magical creatures
	damn it, we're still with the slytherins
	double divination this afternoon, harry groaned, looking down
	divination was his least favorite subject, apart from potions
	professor trelawney kept predicting harry's death, which he found extremely annoying
	you should have given it up like me, shouldn't you said hermione briskly, buttering herself some toast
	then you'd be doing something sensible like arithmancy
	you're eating again, i notice, said ron, watching hermione adding liberal amounts of jam to her toast too
	i've decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights, said hermione haughtily
	and you were hungry, said ron, grinning
	there was a sudden rustling noise above them, and a hundred owls came soaring through the open windows carrying the morning mail
	instinctively, harry looked up, but there was no sign of white among the mass of brown and gray
	the owls circled the tables, looking for the people to whom their letters and packages were addressed
	a large tawny owl soared down to neville longbottom and deposited a parcel into his lap  neville almost always forgot to pack something
	on the other side of the hall draco malfoy's eagle owl had landed on his shoulder, carrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets and cakes from home
	trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach, harry returned to his porridge
	was it possible that something had happened to hedwig, and that sirius hadn't even got his letterhis preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by professor sprout showing the class the ugliest plants harry had ever seen
	indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil
	each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid
	bubotubers, professor sprout told them briskly
	you will collect the pus the what said seamus finnigan, sounding revolted
	pus, finnigan, pus, said professor sprout, and it's extremely valuable, so don't waste it
	you will collect the pus, i say, in these bottles
	wear your dragonhide gloves it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus
	squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying
	as each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowishgreen liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol
	they caught it in the bottles as professor sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints
	this'll keep madam pomfrey happy, said professor sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork
	an excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus
	should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples
	like poor eloise midgen, said hannah abbott, a hufflepuff, in a hushed voice
	she tried to curse hers off
	silly girl, said professor sprout, shaking her head
	but madam pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end
	a booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds, signaling the end of the lesson, and the class separated the hufflepuffs climbing the stone steps for transfiguration, and the gryffindors heading in the other direction, down the sloping lawn toward hagrid's small wooden cabin, which stood on the edge of the forbidden forest
	hagrid was standing outside his hut, one hand on the collar of his enormous black boarhound, fang
	there were several open wooden crates on the ground at his feet, and fang was whimpering and straining at his collar, apparently keen to investigate the contents more closely
	as they drew nearer, an odd rattling noise reached their ears, punctuated by what sounded like minor explosions
	mornin' hagrid said, grinning at harry, ron, and hermione
	be'er wait fer the slytherins, they won' want ter miss this  blastended skrewtscome again said ron
	hagrid pointed down into the crates
	eurgh  squealed lavender brown, jumping backward
	eurgh just about summed up the blastended skrewts in harry's opinion
	they looked like deformed, shellless lobsters, horribly pale and slimylooking, with legs sticking out in very odd places and no visible heads
	there were about a hundred of them in each crate, each about six inches long, crawling over one another, bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes
	they were giving off a very powerful smell of rotting fish
	every now and then, sparks would fly out of the end of a skrewt, and with a small phut, it would be propelled forward several inches
	on'y jus' hatched, said hagrid proudly, so yeh'll be able ter raise 'em yerselves thought we'd make a bit of a project of itand why would we want to raise them said a cold voice
	the slytherins had arrived
	the speaker was draco malfoy
	crabbe and goyle were chuckling appreciatively at his words
	hagrid looked stumped at the question
	i mean, what do they do asked malfoy
	what is the point of themhagrid opened his mouth, apparently thinking hard there was a few seconds' pause, then he said roughly, tha's next lesson, malfoy
	yer jus' feedin' 'em today
	now, yeh'll wan' ter try 'em on a few diff'rent things  i've never had 'em before, not sure what they'll go fer  i got ant eggs an' frog livers an' a bit o' grass snake  just try 'em out with a bit of each
	first pus and now this, muttered seamus
	nothing but deep affection for hagrid could have made harry, ron, and hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the blastended skrewts
	harry couldn't suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was entirely pointless, because the skrewts didn't seem to have mouths
	ouch yelled dean thomas after about ten minutes
	hagrid hurried over to him, looking anxious
	its end exploded said dean angrily, showing hagrid a burn on his hand
	ah, yeah, that can happen when they blast off, said hagrid, nodding
	eurgh said lavender brown again
	eurgh, hagrid, what's that pointy thing on itah, some of 'em have got stings, said hagrid enthusiastically lavender quickly withdrew her hand from the box
	i reckon they're the males
	the females've got sorta sucker things on their bellies
	i think they might be ter suck blood
	well, i can certainly see why we're trying to keep them alive, said malfoy sarcastically
	who wouldn't want pets that can burn, sting, and bite all at oncejust because they're not very pretty, it doesn't mean they're not useful, hermione snapped
	dragon blood's amazingly magical, but you wouldn't want a dragon for a pet, would youharry and ron grinned at hagrid, who gave them a furtive smile from behind his bushy beard
	hagrid would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon, as harry, ron, and hermione knew only too well  he had owned one for a brief period during their first year, a vicious norwegian ridgeback by the name of norbert
	hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures, the more lethal, the better
	well, at least the skrewts are small, said ron as they made their way back up to the castle for lunch an hour later
	they are now, said hermione in an exasperated voice, but once hagrid's found out what they eat, i expect they'll be six feet long
	well, that won't matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something, will it said ron, grinning slyly at her
	you know perfectly well i only said that to shut malfoy up, said hermione
	as a matter of fact i think he's right
	the best thing to do would be to stamp on the lot of them before they start attacking us all
	they sat down at the gryffindor table and helped themselves to lamb chops and potatoes
	hermione began to eat so fast that harry and ron stared at her
	er  is this the new stand on elf rights said ron
	you're going to make yourself puke insteadno, said hermione, with as much dignity as she could muster with her mouth bulging with sprouts
	i just want to get to the library
	what said ron in disbelief
	hermione  it's the first day back  we haven't even got homework yethermione shrugged and continued to shovel down her food as though she had not eaten for days
	then she leapt to her feet, said, see you at dinner  and departed at high speed
	when the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons, harry and ron set off for north tower where, at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase, a silver stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling, and the room where professor trelawney lived
	the familiar sweet perfume spreading from the fire met their nostrils as they emerged at the top of the stepladder
	as ever, the curtains were all closed the circular room was bathed in a dim reddish light cast by the many lamps, which were all draped with scarves and shawls
	harry and ron walked through the mass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that cluttered the room, and sat down at the same small circular table
	good day, said the misty voice of professor trelawney right behind harry, making him jump
	a very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes appear far too large for her face, professor trelawney was peering down at harry with the tragic expression she always wore whenever she saw him
	the usual large amount of beads, chains, and bangles glittered upon her person in the firelight
	you are preoccupied, my dear, she said mournfully to harry
	my inner eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within
	and i regret to say that your worries are not baseless
	i see difficult times ahead for you, alas
	i fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass
	and perhaps sooner than you think
	her voice dropped almost to a whisper
	ron rolled his eyes at harry, who looked stonily back
	professor trelawney swept past them and seated herself in a large winged armchair before the fire, facing the class
	lavender brown and parvati patil, who deeply admired professor trelawney, were sitting on poufs very close to her
	my dears, it is time for us to consider the stars, she said
	the movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance
	human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays, which intermingle
	but harry's thoughts had drifted
	the perfumed fire always made him feel sleepy and dullwitted, and professor trelawney's rambling talks on fortunetelling never held him exactly spellbound  though he couldn't help thinking about what she had just said to him
	i fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass
	'but hermione was right, harry thought irritably, professor trelawney really was an old fraud
	he wasn't dreading anything at the moment at all
	well, unless you counted his fears that sirius had been caught
	but what did professor trelawney know  he had long since come to the conclusion that her brand of fortunetelling was really no more than lucky guesswork and a spooky manner
	except, of course, for that time at the end of last term, when she had made the prediction about voldemort rising again
	and dumbledore himself had said that he thought that trance had been genuine, when harry had described it to him
	whatharry looked around the whole class was staring at him
	he sat up straight he had been almost dozing off, lost in the heat and his thoughts
	i was saying, my dear, that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of saturn, said professor trelawney, a faint note of resentment in her voice at the fact that he had obviously not been hanging on her words
	born under  what, sorry said harry
	saturn, dear, the planet saturn  said professor trelawney, sounding definitely irritated that he wasn't riveted by this news
	i was saying that saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your birth
	tragic losses so young in life
	i think i am right in saying, my dear, that you were born in midwinterno, said harry, i was born in july
	ron hastily turned his laugh into a hacking cough
	half an hour later, each of them had been given a complicated circular chart, and was attempting to fill in the position of the planets at their moment of birth
	it was dull work, requiring much consultation of timetables and calculation of angles
	i've got two neptunes here, said harry after a while, frowning down at his piece of parchment, that can't be right, can itaaaaah, said ron, imitating professor trelawney's mystical whisper, when two neptunes appear in the sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born, harry
	seamus and dean, who were working nearby, sniggered loudly, though not loudly enough to mask the excited squeals from lavender brown  oh professor, look i think i've got an unaspected planet oooh, which one's that, professorit is uranus, my dear, said professor trelawney, peering down at the chart
	can i have a look at uranus too, lavender said ron
	most unfortunately, professor trelawney heard him, and it was this, perhaps, that made her give them so much homework at the end of the class
	a detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you, with reference to your personal chart, she snapped, sounding much more like professor mcgonagall than her usual airyfairy self
	i want it ready to hand in next monday, and no excusesmiserable old bat, said ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending the staircases back to the great hall and dinner
	that'll take all weekend, that will
	lots of homework said hermione brightly, catching up with them
	professor vector didn't give us any at allwell, bully for professor vector, said ron moodily
	they reached the entrance hall, which was packed with people queuing for dinner
	they had just joined the end of the line, when a loud voice rang out behind them
	weasley  hey, weasleyharry, ron, and hermione turned
	malfoy, crabbe, and goyle were standing there, each looking thoroughly pleased about something
	what said ron shortly
	your dad's in the paper, weasley  said malfoy, brandishing a copy of the daily prophet and speaking very loudly, so that everyone in the packed entrance hall could hear
	listen to thisfurther mistakes at the ministry of magicit seems as though the ministry of magic's troubles are not yet at an end, writes rita skeeter, special correspondent
	recently under fire for its poorcrowd control at the quidditch world cup, and still unable to account for the disappearance of one of its witches, the ministry was plunged into fresh embarrassment yesterday by the antics of arnold weasley, of the misuse of muggle artifacts office
	imagine them not even getting his name right, weasley
	it's almost as though he's a complete nonentity, isn't it  he crowed
	everyone in the entrance hall was listening now
	malfoy straightened the paper with a flourish and read onarnold weasley, who was charged with possession of a flying car two years ago, was yesterday involved in a tussle with several muggle lawkeepers policemen over a number of highly aggressive dustbins
	weasley appears to have rushed to the aid of madeye moody, the aged exauror who retired from the ministry when no longer able to tell the difference between a handshake and attempted murder
	weasley found, upon arrival at mr
	moody's heavily guarded house, that mr
	moody had once again raised a false alarm
	weasley was forced to modify several memories before he could escape from the policemen, but refused to answer daily prophet questions about why he had involved the ministry in such an undignified and potentially embarrassing scene
	and there's a picture, weasley  said malfoy, flipping the paper over and holding it up
	a picture of your parents outside their house  if you can call it a house  your mother could do with losing a bit of weight, couldn't sheron was shaking with fury
	everyone was staring at him
	get stuffed, malfoy, said harry
	oh yeah, you were staying with them this summer, weren't you, potter  sneered malfoy
	so tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the pictureyou know your mother, malfoy  said harry  both he and hermione had grabbed the back of ron's robes to stop him from launching himself at malfoy  that expression she's got, like she's got dung under her nose  has she always looked like that, or was it just because you were with hermalfoy's pale face went slightly pink
	don't you dare insult my mother, potter
	keep your fat mouth shut, then, said harry, turning away
	bangseveral people screamed  harry felt something whitehot graze the side of his face  he plunged his hand into his robes for his wand, but before he'd even touched it, he heard a second loud bang, and a roar that echoed through the entrance hall
	oh no you don't, laddieharry spun around
	professor moody was limping down the marble staircase
	his wand was out and it was pointing right at a pure white ferret, which was shivering on the stoneflagged floor, exactly where malfoy had been standing
	there was a terrified silence in the entrance hall
	nobody but moody was moving a muscle
	moody turned to look at harry  at least, his normal eye was looking at harry the other one was pointing into the back of his head
	did he get you  moody growled
	his voice was low and gravelly
	no, said harry, missed
	leave it  moody shouted
	leave  what harry said, bewildered
	not you  him moody growled, jerking his thumb over his shoulder at crabbe, who had just frozen, about to pick up the white ferret
	it seemed that moody's rolling eye was magical and could see out of the back of his head
	moody started to limp toward crabbe, goyle, and the ferret, which gave a terrified squeak and took off, streaking toward the dungeons
	i don't think so roared moody, pointing his wand at the ferret again  it flew ten feet into the air, fell with a smack to the floor, and then bounced upward once more
	i don't like people who attack when their opponent's back's turned, growled moody as the ferret bounced higher and higher, squealing in pain
	stinking, cowardly, scummy thing to do
	the ferret flew through the air, its legs and tail flailing helplessly
	never  do  that  again  said moody, speaking each word as the ferret hit the stone floor and bounced upward again
	professor moody  said a shocked voice
	professor mcgonagall was coming down the marble staircase with her arms full of books
	hello, professor mcgonagall, said moody calmly, bouncing the ferret still higher
	what  what are you doing  said professor mcgonagall, her eyes following the bouncing ferret's progress through the air
	teach  moody, is that a student  shrieked professor mcgonagall, the books spilling out of her arms
	no  cried professor mcgonagall, running down the stairs and pulling out her wand a moment later, with a loud snapping noise, draco malfoy had reappeared, lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly pink face
	he got to his feet, wincing
	moody, we never use transfiguration as a punishment said professor mcgonagall wealdy
	surely professor dumbledore told you thathe might've mentioned it, yeah, said moody, scratching his chin unconcernedly, but i thought a good sharp shock we give detentions, moody  or speak to the offender's head of housei'll do that, then, said moody, staring at malfoy with great dislike
	malfoy, whose pale eyes were still watering with pain and humiliation, looked malevolently up at moody and muttered something in which the words my father were distinguishable
	oh yeah said moody quietly, limping forward a few steps, the dull clunk of his wooden leg echoing around the hall
	well, i know your father of old, boy
	you tell him moody's keeping a close eye on his son
	you tell him that from me
	now, your head of house'll be snape, will it yes, said malfoy resentfully
	another old friend, growled moody
	i've been looking forward to a chat with old snape
	and he seized malfoy's upper arm and marched him off toward the dungeons
	professor mcgonagall stared anxiously after them for a few moments, then waved her wand at her fallen books, causing them to soar up into the air and back into her arms
	don't talk to me, ron said quietly to harry and hermione as they sat down at the gryffindor table a few minutes later, surrounded by excited talk on all sides about what had just happened
	why not said hermione in surprise
	because i want to fix that in my memory forever, said ron, his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face
	draco malfoy, the amazing bouncing ferret
	harry and hermione both laughed, and hermione began doling beef casserole onto each of their plates
	he could have really hurt malfoy, though, she said
	it was good, really, that professor mcgonagall stopped it hermione said ron furiously, his eyes snapping open again, you're ruining the best moment of my lifehermione made an impatient noise and began to eat at top speed again
	don't tell me you're going back to the library this evening said harry, watching her
	got to, said hermione thickly
	but you told us professor vector it's not schoolwork, she said
	within five minutes, she had cleared her plate and departed
	no sooner had she gone than her seat was taken by fred weasley
	how cool is hebeyond cool, said george, sitting down opposite fred
	supercool, said the twins' best friend, lee jordan, sliding into the seat beside george
	we had him this afternoon, he told harry and ron
	what was it like said harry eagerly
	fred, george, and lee exchanged looks full of meaning
	never had a lesson like it, said fred
	he knows, man, said lee
	knows what said ron, leaning forward
	knows what it's like to be out there doing it, said george impressively
	doing what said harry
	fighting the dark arts, said fred
	he's seen it all, said george
	ron dived into his bag for his schedule
	we haven't got him till thursday  he said in a disappointed voice
	chapter fourteen  the unforgivable cursesthe next two days passed without great incident, unless you counted neville melting his sixth cauldron in potions
	professor snape, who seemed to have attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer, gave nevihle detention, and neville returned from it in a state of nervous collapse, having been made to disembowel a barrel full of horned toads
	you know why snape's in such a foul mood, don't you said ron to harry as they watched hermione teaching neville a scouring charm to remove the frog guts from under his fingernails
	it was common knowledge that snape really wanted the dark arts job, and he had now failed to get it for the fourth year running
	snape had disliked all of their previous dark arts teachers, and shown it  but he seemed strangely wary of displaying overt animosity to madeye moody
	indeed, whenever harry saw the two of them together  at mealtimes, or when they passed in the corridors  he had the distinct impression that snape was avoiding moody's eye, whether magical or normal
	i reckon snape's a bit scared of him, you know, harry said thoughtfully
	imagine if moody turned snape into a horned toad, said ron, his eyes misting over, and bounced him all around his dungeon
	the gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to moody's first lesson so much that they arrived early on thursday lunchtime and queued up outside his classroom before the bell had even rung
	the only person missing was hermione, who turned up just in time for the lesson
	harry finished her sentence for her
	c'mon, quick, or we won't get decent seats
	they hurried into three chairs right in front of the teacher's desk, took out their copies of the dark forces  a guide to selfprotection, and waited, unusually quiet
	soon they heard moody's distinctive clunking footsteps coming down the corridor, and he entered the room, looking as strange and frightening as ever
	they could just see his clawed, wooden foot protruding from underneath his robes
	you can put those away, he growled, stumping over to his desk and sitting down, those books
	you won't need them
	they returned the books to their bags, ron looking excited
	moody took out a register, shook his long mane of grizzled gray hair out of his twisted and scarred face, and began to call out names, his normal eye moving steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled around, fixing upon each student as he or she answered
	right then, he said, when the last person had declared themselves present, i've had a letter from professor lupin about this class
	seems you've had a pretty thorough grounding in tackling dark creatures  you've covered boggarts, red caps, hinkypunks, grindylows, kappas, and werewolves, is that rightthere was a general murmur of assent
	but you're behind  very behind  on dealing with curses, said moody
	so i'm here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other
	i've got one year to teach you how to deal with dark what, aren't you staying  ron blurted out
	moody's magical eye spun around to stare at ron ron looked extremely apprehensive, but after a moment moody smiled  the first time harry had seen him do so
	the effect was to make his heavily scarred face look more twisted and contorted than ever, but it was nevertheless good to know that he ever did anything as friendly as smile
	ron looked deeply relieved
	you'll be arthur weasley's son, eh  moody said
	your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago
	yeah, i'm staying just the one year
	special favor to dumbledore
	one year, and then back to my quiet retirement
	he gave a harsh laugh, and then clapped his gnarled hands together
	they come in many strengths and forms
	now, according to the ministry of magic, i'm supposed to teach you countercurses and leave it at that
	i'm not supposed to show you what illegal dark curses look like until you're in the sixth year
	you're not supposed to be old enough to deal with it till then
	but professor dumbledore's got a higher opinion of your nerves, he reckons you can cope, and i say, the sooner you know what you're up against, the better
	how are you supposed to defend yourself against something you've never seen  a wizard who's about to put an illegal curse on you isn't going to tell you what he's about to do
	he's not going to do it nice and polite to your face
	you need to be prepared
	you need to be alert and watchful
	you need to put that away, miss brown, when i'm talking
	lavender jumped and blushed
	she had been showing parvati her completed horoscope under the desk
	apparently moody's magical eye could see through solid wood, as well as out of the back of his head
	do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by wizarding lawseveral hands rose tentatively into the air, including ron's and hermione's
	moody pointed at ron, though his magical eye was still fixed on lavender
	er, said ron tentatively, my dad told me about one
	is it called the imperius curse, or somethingah, yes, said moody appreciatively
	your father would know that one
	gave the ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the imperius curse
	moody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk drawer, and took out a glass jar
	three large black spiders were scuttling around inside it
	harry felt ron recoil slightly next to him  ron hated spiders
	moody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders, and held it in the palm of his hand so that they could all see it
	he then pointed his wand at it and muttered, imperiothe spider leapt from moody's hand on a fine thread of silk and began to swing backward and forward as though on a trapeze
	it stretched out its legs rigidly, then did a back flip, breaking the thread and landing on the desk, where it began to cartwheel in circles
	moody jerked his wand, and the spider rose onto two of its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap dance
	everyone was laughing  everyone except moody
	think it's funny, do you he growled
	you'd like it, would you, if i did it to youthe laughter died away almost instantly
	total control, said moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began to roll over and over
	i could make it jump out of the window, drown itself, throw itself down one of your throats
	ron gave an involuntary shudder
	years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the imperius curse, said moody, and harry knew he was talking about the days in which voldemort had been allpowerful
	some job for the ministry, trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their own free will
	the imperius curse can be fought, and i'll be teaching you how, but it takes real strength of character, and not everyone's got it
	better avoid being hit with it if you can
	constant vigilance  he barked, and everyone jumped
	moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar
	anyone else know one  another illegal cursehermione's hand flew into the air again and so, to harry's slight surprise, did neville's
	the only class in which neville usually volunteered information was herbology which was easily his best subject
	neville looked surprised at his own daring
	yes said moody, his magical eye rolling right over to fix on neville
	there's one  the cruciatus curse, said neville in a small but distinct voice
	moody was looking very intently at neville, this time with both eyes
	your name's longbottom  he said, his magical eye swooping down to check the register again
	neville nodded nervously, but moody made no further inquiries
	turning back to the class at large, he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon the desktop, where it remained motionless, apparently too scared to move
	the cruciatus curse, said moody
	needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea, he said, pointing his wand at the spider
	engorgiothe spider swelled
	it was now larger than a tarantula
	abandoning all pretense, ron pushed his chair backward, as far away from moody's desk as possible
	moody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider, and muttered, crucioat once, the spider's legs bent in upon its body it rolled over and began to twitch horribly, rocking from side to side
	no sound came from it, but harry was sure that if it could have given voice, it would have been screaming
	moody did not remove his wand, and the spider started to shudder and jerk more violently  stop it hermione said shrilly
	harry looked around at her
	she was looking, not at the spider, but at neville, and harry, following her gaze, saw that neville's hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes wide and horrified
	moody raised his wand
	the spider's legs relaxed, but it continued to twitch
	reducio, moody muttered, and the spider shrank back to its proper size
	he put it back into the jar
	pain, said moody softly
	you don't need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the cruciatus curse
	that one was very popular once too
	anyone know any othersharry looked around
	from the looks on everyone's faces, he guessed they were all wondering what was going to happen to the last spider
	hermione's hand shook slightly as, for the third time, she raised it into the air
	yes said moody, looking at her
	avada kedavra,  hermione whispered
	several people looked uneasily around at her, including ron
	ah, said moody, another slight smile twisting his lopsided mouth
	yes, the last and worst
	he put his hand into the glass jar, and almost as though it knew what was coming, the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar, trying to evade moody's fingers, but he trapped it, and placed it upon the desktop
	it started to scuttle frantically across the wooden surface
	moody raised his wand, and harry felt a sudden thrill of foreboding
	avada kedavra  moody roared
	there was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as though a vast, invisible something was soaring through the air  instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but unmistakably dead
	several of the students stifled cries ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him
	moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor
	not nice, he said calmly
	and there's no countercurse
	there's no blocking it
	only one known person has ever survived it, and he's sitting right in front of me
	harry felt his face redden as moody's eyes both of them looked into his own
	he could feel everyone else looking around at him too
	harry stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at all
	so that was how his parents had died
	exactly like that spider
	had they been unblemished and unmarked too  had they simply seen the flash of green light and heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their bodiesharry had been picturing his parents' deaths over and over again for three years now, ever since he'd found out they had been murdered, ever since he'd found out what had happened that night  wormtail had betrayed his parents' whereabouts to voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage
	how voldemort had killed harry's father first
	how james potter had tried to hold him off, while he shouted at his wife to take harry and run
	voldemort had advanced on lily potter, told her to move aside so that he could kill harry
	how she had begged him to kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her son
	and so voldemort had murdered her too, before turning his wand on harry
	harry knew these details because he had heard his parents' voices when he had fought the dementors last year  for that was the terrible power of the dementors to force their victims to relive the worst memories of their lives, and drown, powerless, in their own despair
	moody was speaking again, from a great distance, it seemed to harry
	with a massive effort, he pulled himself back to the present and listened to what moody was saying
	avada kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it  you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and i doubt i'd get so much as a nosebleed
	but that doesn't matter
	i'm not here to teach you how to do it
	now, if there's no countercurse, why am i showing you  because you've got to know
	you've got to appreciate what the worst is
	you don't want to find yourself in a situation where you're facing it
	constant vigilance  he roared, and the whole class jumped again
	those three curses  avada kedavra, imperius, and cruciatus  are known as the unforgivable curses
	the use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in azkaban
	that's what you're up against
	that's what i've got to teach you to fight
	but most of all, you need to practice constant, neverceasing vigilance
	get out your quills
	they spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the unforgivable curses
	no one spoke until the bell rang  but when moody had dismissed them and they had left the classroom, a torrent of talk burst forth
	most people were discussing the curses in awed voices  did you see it twitch  and when he killed it  just like thatthey were talking about the lesson, harry thought, as though it had been some sort of spectacular show, but he hadn't found it very entertaining  and nor, it seemed, had hermione
	hurry up, she said tensely to harry and ron
	not the ruddy library again said ron
	no, said hermione curtly, pointing up a side passage
	neville was standing alone, halfway up the passage, staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same horrified, wideeyed look he had worn when moody had demonstrated the cruciatus curse
	neville  hermione said gently
	neville looked around
	oh hello, he said, his voice much higher than usual
	interesting lesson, wasn't it  i wonder what's for dinner, i'm  i'm starving, aren't youneville, are you all right  said hermione
	oh yes, i'm fine, neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice
	very interesting dinner  i mean lesson  what's for eatingron gave harry a startled look
	neville, what  but an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they turned to see professor moody limping toward them
	all four of them fell silent, watching him apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard
	it's all right, sonny, he said to neville
	why don't you come up to my office  come on
	we can have a cup of tea
	neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with moody
	he neither moved nor spoke
	moody turned his magical eye upon harry
	you all right, are you, potteryes, said harry, almost defiantly
	moody's blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed harry
	then he said, you've got to know
	it seems harsh, maybe, but you've got to know
	no point pretending
	come on, longbottom, i've got some books that might interest you
	neville looked pleadingly at harry, ron, and hermione, but they didn't say anything, so neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away, one of moody's gnarled hands on his shoulder
	what was that about  said ron, watching neville and moody turn the corner
	i don't know, said hermione, looking pensive
	some lesson, though, eh said ron to harry as they set off for the great hall
	fred and george were right, weren't they  he really knows his stuff, moody, doesn't he  when he did avada kedavra, the way that spider just died, just snuffed it right but ron fell suddenly silent at the look on harry's face and didn't speak again until they reached the great hall, when he said he supposed they had better make a start on professor trelawney's predictions tonight, since they would take hours
	hermione did not join in with harry and ron's conversation during dinner, but ate furiously fast, and then left for the library again
	harry and ron walked back to gryffindor tower, and harry, who had been thinking of nothing else all through dinner, now raised the subject of the unforgivable curses himself
	wouldn't moody and dumbledore be in trouble with the ministry if they knew we'd seen the curses  harry asked as they approached the fat lady
	yeah, probably, said ron
	but dumbledore's always done things his way, hasn't he, and moody's been getting in trouble for years, i reckon
	attacks first and asks questions later  look at his dustbins
	the fat lady swung forward to reveal the entrance hole, and they climbed into the gryffindor common room, which was crowded and noisy
	shall we get our divination stuff, then  said harry
	i s'pose, ron groaned
	they went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts, to find neville there alone, sitting on his bed, reading
	he looked a good deal calmer than at the end of moody's lesson, though still not entirely normal
	his eyes were rather red
	you all right, neville harry asked him
	oh yes, said neville, i'm fine, thanks
	just reading this book professor moody lent me
	he held up the book  magical water plants of the mediterranean
	apparently, professor sprout told professor moody i'm really good at herbology, neville said
	there was a faint note of pride in his voice that harry had rarely heard there before
	he thought i'd like this
	telling neville what professor sprout had said, harry thought, had been a very tactful way of cheering neville up, for neville very rarely heard that he was good at anything
	it was the sort of thing professor lupin would have done
	harry and ron took their copies of unfogging the future back down to the common room, found a table, and set to work on their predictions for the coming month
	an hour later, they had made very little progress, though their table was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols, and harry's brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from professor trelawney's fire
	i haven't got a clue what this lot's supposed to mean, he said, staring down at a long list of calculations
	you know, said ron, whose hair was on end because of all the times he had run his fingers through it in frustration, i think it's back to the old divination standby
	what  make it upyeah, said ron, sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table, dipping his pen into some ink, and starting to write
	next monday, he said as he scribbled, i am likely to develop a cough, owing to the unlucky conjunction of mars and jupiter
	he looked up at harry
	you know her  just put in loads of misery, she'll lap it up
	right, said harry, crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire
	on monday, i will be in danger of er  burns
	yeah, you will be, said ron darkly, we're seeing the skrewts again on monday
	lose a treasured possession, said harry, who was flicking through unfogging the future for ideas
	good one, said ron, copying it down
	why don't you get stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friendyeah
	said harry, scribbling it down, because
	venus is in the twelfth house
	and on wednesday, i think i'll come off worst in a fight
	aaah, i was going to have a fight
	okay, i'll lose a bet
	yeah, you'll be betting i'll win my fight
	they continued to make up predictions which grew steadily more tragic for another hour, while the common room around them slowly emptied as people went up to bed
	crookshanks wandered over to them, leapt lightly into an empty chair, and stared inscrutably at harry, rather as hermione might look if she knew they weren't doing their homework properly
	staring around the room, trying to think of a kind of misfortune he hadn't yet used, harry saw fred and george sitting together against the opposite wall, heads together, quills out, poring over a single piece of parchment
	it was most unusual to see fred and george hidden away in a corner and working silently they usually liked to be in the thick of things and the noisy center of attention
	there was something secretive about the way they were working on the piece of parchment, and harry was reminded of how they had sat together writing something back at the burrow
	he had thought then that it was another order form for weasleys' wizard wheezes, but it didn't look like that this time if it had been, they would surely have let lee jordan in on the joke
	he wondered whether it had anything to do with entering the triwizard tournament
	as harry watched, george shook his head at fred, scratched out something with his quill, and said, in a very quiet voice that nevertheless carried across the almost deserted room, no  that sounds like we're accusing him
	then george looked over and saw harry watching him
	harry grinned and quickly returned to his predictions  he didn't want george to think he was eavesdropping
	shortly after that, the twins rolled up their parchment, said good night, and went off to bed
	fred and george had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened and hermione climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the other
	crookshanks arched his back, purring
	hello, she said, i've just finishedso have i said ron triumphantly, throwing down his quill
	hermione sat down, laid the things she was carrying in an empty armchair, and pulled ron's predictions toward her
	not going to have a very good month, are you she said sardonically as crookshanks curled up in her lap
	ah well, at least i'm forewarned, ron yawned
	you seem to be drowning twice, said hermione
	oh am i  said ron, peering down at his predictions
	i'd better change one of them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriff
	don't you think it's a bit obvious you've made these up said hermione
	how dare you said ron, in mock outrage
	we've been working like houseelves herehermione raised her eyebrows
	it's just an expression, said ron hastily
	harry laid down his quill too, having just finished predicting his own death by decapitation
	what's in the box he asked, pointing at it
	funny you should ask, said hermione, with a nasty look at ron
	she took off the lid and showed them the contents
	inside were about fifty badges, all of different colors, but all bearing the same letters s
	spew  said harry, picking up a badge and looking at it
	what's this aboutnot spew, said hermione impatiently
	stands for the society for the promotion of elfish welfare
	never heard of it, said ron
	well, of course you haven't, said hermione briskly, i've only just started it
	yeah said ron in mild surprise
	how many members have you gotwell  if you two join  three, said hermione
	and you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying 'spew,' do you said ron
	spew said hermione hotly
	i was going to put stop the outrageous abuse of our fellow magical creatures and campaign for a change in their legal status  but it wouldn't fit
	so that's the heading of our manifesto
	she brandished the sheaf of parchment at them
	i've been researching it thoroughly in the library
	elf enslavement goes back centuries
	i can't believe no one's done anything about it before now
	hermione  open your ears, said ron loudly
	they like being enslavedour shortterm aims, said hermione, speaking even more loudly than ron, and acting as though she hadn't heard a word, are to secure houseelves fair wages and working conditions
	our longterm aims include changing the law about nonwand use, and trying to get an elf into the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures, because they're shockingly underrepresented
	and how do we do all this harry asked
	we start by recruiting members, said hermione happily
	i thought two sickles to join  that buys a badge  and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign
	you're treasurer, ron  i've got you a collecting tin upstairs  and harry, you're secretary, so you might want to write down everything i'm saying now, as a record of our first meeting
	there was a pause in which hermione beamed at the pair of them, and harry sat, torn between exasperation at hermione and amusement at the look on ron's face
	the silence was broken, not by ron, who in any case looked as though he was temporarily dumbstruck, but by a soft tap, tap on the window
	harry looked across the now empty common room and saw, illuminated by the moonlight, a snowy owl perched on the windowsill
	hedwig  he shouted, and he launched himself out of his chair and across the room to pull open the window
	hedwig flew inside, soared across the room, and landed on the table on top of harry's predictions
	about time said harry, hurrying after her
	she's got an answer said ron excitedly, pointing at the grubby piece of parchment tied to hedwig's leg
	harry hastily untied it and sat down to read, whereupon hedwig fluttered onto his knee, hooting softly
	what does it say hermione asked breathlessly
	the letter was very short, and looked as though it had been scrawled in a great hurry
	harry read it aloudharry  i'm flying north immediately
	this news about your scar is the latest in a series of strange rumors that have reached me here
	if it hurts again, go straight to dumbledore  they're saying he's got madeye out of retirement, which means he's reading the signs, even if no one else is
	i'll be in touch soon
	my best to ron and hermione
	keep your eyes open, harry
	siriusharry looked up at ron and hermione, who stared back at him
	he's flying north  hermione whispered
	he's coming back dumbledore's reading what signs said ron, looking perplexed
	harry  what's upfor harry had just hit himself in the forehead with his fist, jolting hedwig out of his lap
	i shouldn't've told him harry said furiously
	what are you on about said ron in surprise
	it's made him think he's got to come back said harry, now slamming his fist on the table so that hedwig landed on the back of ron's chair, hooting indignantly
	coming back, because he thinks i'm in trouble  and there's nothing wrong with me  and i haven't got anything for you, harry snapped at hedwig, who was clicking her beak expectantly, you'll have to go up to the owlery if you want food
	hedwig gave him an extremely offended look and took off for the open window, cuffing him around the head with her outstretched wing as she went
	harry, hermione began, in a pacifying sort of voice
	i'm going to bed, said harry shortly
	see you in the morning
	upstairs in the dormitory he pulled on his pajamas and got into his fourposter, but he didn't feel remotely tired
	if sirius came back and got caught, it would be his, harry's, fault
	why hadn't he kept his mouth shut  a few seconds' pain and he'd had to blab
	if he'd just had the sense to keep it to himself
	he heard ron come up into the dormitory a short while later, but did not speak to him
	for a long time, harry lay staring up at the dark canopy of his bed
	the dormitory was completely silent, and, had he been less preoccupied, harry would have realized that the absence of neville's usual snores meant that he was not the only one lying awake
	chapter fifteen  beauxbatons and durmstrangearly next morning, harry woke with a plan fully formed in his mind, as though his sleeping brain had been working on it all night
	he got up, dressed in the pale dawn light, left the dormitory without waking ron, and went back down to the deserted common room
	here he took a piece of parchment from the table upon which his divination homework still lay and wrote the following letterdear sirius,i reckon i just imagined my scar hurting, i was half asleep when i wrote to you last time
	there's no point coming back, everything's fine here
	don't worry about me, my head feels completely normal
	harryhe then climbed out of the portrait hole, up through the silent castle held up only briefly by peeves, who tried to overturn a large vase on him halfway along the fourthfloor corridor, finally arriving at the owlery, which was situated at the top of west tower
	the owlery was a circular stone room, rather cold and drafty, because none of the windows had glass in them
	the floor was entirely covered in straw, owl droppings, and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles
	hundreds upon hundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose right up to the top of the tower, nearly all of them asleep, though here and there a round amber eye glared at harry
	he spotted hedwig nestled between a barn owl and a tawny, and hurried over to her, sliding a little on the droppingstrewn floor
	it took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at him, as she kept shuffling around on her perch, showing him her tail
	she was evidently still furious about his lack of gratitude the previous night
	in the end, it was harry suggesting she might be too tired, and that perhaps he would ask ron to borrow pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it
	just find him, all right  harry said, stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall
	before the dementors do
	she nipped his finger, perhaps rather harder than she would ordinarily have done, but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same
	then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise
	harry watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach
	he had been so sure that sirius's reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them
	that was a lie, harry, said hermione sharply over breakfast, when he told her and ron what he had done
	you didn't imagine your scar hurting and you know it
	he's not going back to azkaban because of me
	drop it, said ron sharply to hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some more, and for once, hermione heeded him, and fell silent
	harry did his best not to worry about sirius over the next couple of weeks
	true, he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived, nor, late at night before he went to sleep, prevent himself from seeing horrible visions of sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark london street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his godfather
	he wished he still had quidditch to distract him nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good, hard training session
	on the other hand, their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever before, particularly moody's defense against the dark arts
	to their surprise, professor moody had announced that he would be putting the imperius curse on each of them in turn, to demonstrate its power and to see whether they could resist its effects
	but  but you said it's illegal, professor, said hermione uncertainly as moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room
	you said  to use it against another human was dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like, said moody, his magical eye swiveling onto hermione and fixing her with an eerie, unblinking stare
	if you'd rather learn the hard way  when someone's putting it on you so they can control you completely  fine by me
	he pointed one gnarled finger toward the door
	hermione went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave
	harry and ron grinned at each other
	they knew hermione would rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an important lesson
	moody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the imperius curse upon them
	harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence
	dean thomas hopped three times around the room, singing the national anthem
	lavender brown imitated a squirrel
	neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have been capable of in his normal state
	not one of them seemed to be able to fight off the curse, and each of them recovered only when moody had removed it
	potter, moody growled, you next
	harry moved forward into the middle of the classroom, into the space that moody had cleared of desks
	moody raised his wand, pointed it at harry, and said, '1mperioit was the most wonderful feeling
	harry felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness
	he stood there feeling immensely relaxed, only dimly aware of everyone watching him
	and then he heard madeye moody's voice, echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain  jump onto the desk
	harry bent his knees obediently, preparing to spring
	why, though  another voice had awoken in the back of his brain
	stupid thing to do, really, said the voice
	no, i don't think i will, thanks, said the other voice, a little more firmly
	no, i don't really want to
	jump nowthe next thing harry felt was considerable pain
	he had both jumped and tried to prevent himself from jumping  the result was that he'd smashed headlong into the desk knocking it over, and, by the feeling in his legs, fractured both his kneecaps
	now, that's more like it  growled moody's voice, and suddenly, harry felt the empty, echoing feeling in his head disappear
	he remembered exactly what was happening, and the pain in his knees seemed to double
	look at that, you lot
	potter fought  he fought it, and he damn near beat it  we'll try that again, potter, and the rest of you, pay attention  watch his eyes, that's where you see it  very good, potter, very good indeed  they'll have trouble controlling youthe way he talks, harry muttered as he hobbled out of the defense against the dark arts class an hour later moody had insisted on putting harry through his paces four times in a row, until harry could throw off the curse entirely, you'd think we were all going to be attacked any second
	yeah, i know, said ron, who was skipping on every alternate step
	he had had much more difficulty with the curse than harry, though moody assured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime
	talk about paranoid
	ron glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that moody was definitely out of earshot and went on
	no wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the ministry
	did you hear him telling seamus what he did to that witch who shouted 'boo' behind him on april fools' day  and when are we supposed to read up on resisting the imperius curse with everything else we've got to doall the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work they were required to do this term
	professor mcgonagall explained why, when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of transfiguration homework she had assigned
	you are now entering a most important phase of your magical education  she told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles
	your ordinary wizarding levels are drawing closer we don't take o
	s till fifth year s aid dean thomas indignantly
	maybe not, thomas, but believe me, you need all the preparation you can get  miss granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion
	i might remind you that your pincushion, thomas, still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pinhermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed to be trying not to look too pleased with herself
	harry and ron were deeply amused when professor trelawney told them that they had received top marks for their homework in their next divination class
	she read out large portions of their predictions, commending them for their unflinching acceptance of the horrors in store for them  but they were less amused when she asked them to do the same thing for the month after next both of them were running out of ideas for catastrophes
	meanwhile professor binns, the ghost who taught history of magic, had them writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century
	professor snape was forcing them to research antidotes
	they took this one seriously, as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before christmas to see if their antidote worked
	professor flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on summoning charms
	even hagrid was adding to their workload
	the blastended skrewts were growing at a remarkable pace given that nobody had yet discovered what they ate
	hagrid was delighted, and as part of their project, suggested that they come down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make notes on their extraordinary behavior
	i will not, said draco malfoy flatly when hagrid had proposed this with the air of father christmas pulling an extralarge toy out of his sack
	i see enough of these foul things during lessons, thanks
	hagrid's smile faded off his face
	yeh'll do wha' yer told, he growled, or i'll be takin' a leaf outta professor moody's book
	i hear yeh made a good ferret, malfoy
	the gryffindors roared with laughter
	malfoy flushed with anger, but apparently the memory of moody's punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him from retorting
	harry, ron, and hermione returned to the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits seeing hagrid put down malfoy was particularly satisfying, especially because malfoy had done his very best to get hagrid sacked the previous year
	when they arrived in the entrance hall, they found themselves unable to proceed owing to the large crowd of students congregated there, all milling around a large sign that had been erected at the foot of the marble staircase
	ron, the tallest of the three, stood on tiptoe to see over the heads in front of them and read the sign aloud to the other twotriwizard tournamentthe delegations from beauxbatons anddurmstrang will be arriving at 6 o'clockon friday the 30th of october
	lessons willend half an hour early brilliant said harry
	it's potions last thing on friday  snape won't have time to poison us allstudents will return their bags and booksto their dormitories and assemble in frontof the castle to greet our guests beforethe welcoming feast
	only a week away  said ernie macmillan of hufflepuff, emerging from the crowd, his eyes gleaming
	i wonder if cedric knows  think i'll go and tell him
	cedric said ron blankly as ernie hurried off
	he must be entering the tournament
	that idiot, hogwarts champion  said ron as they pushed their way through the chattering crowd toward the staircase
	you just don't like him because he beat gryffindor at quidditch, said hermione
	i've heard he's a really good student  and he's a prefect
	she spoke as though this settled the matter
	you only like him because he's handsome, said ron scathingly
	excuse me, i don't like people just because they're handsome  said hermione indignantly
	ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like lockhartthe appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon the inhabitants of the castle
	during the following week, there seemed to be only one topic of conversation, no matter where harry went  the triwizard tournament
	rumors were flying from student to student like highly contagious germs  who was going to try for hogwarts champion, what the tournament would involve, how the students from beauxbatons and durmstrang differed from themselves
	harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an extrathorough cleaning
	several grimy portraits had been scrubbed, much to the displeasure of their subjects, who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly and wincing as they felt their raw pink faces
	the suits of armor were suddenly gleaming and moving without squeaking, and argus filch, the caretaker, was behaving so ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he terrified a pair of firstyear girls into hysterics
	other members of the staff seemed oddly tense too
	longbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can't even perform a simple switching spell in front of anyone from durmstrang  professor mcgonagall barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson, during which neville had accidentally transplanted his own ears onto a cactus
	when they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of october, they found that the great hall had been decorated overnight
	enormous silk banners hung from the walls, each of them representing a hogwarts house  red with a gold lion for gryffiindor, blue with a bronze eagle for ravenclaw, yellow with a black badger for hufflepuff, and green with a silver serpent for slytherin
	behind the teachers' table, the largest banner of all bore the hogwarts coat of arms lion, eagle, badger, and snake united around a large letter h
	harry, ron, and hermione sat down beside fred and george at the gryffindor table
	once again, and most unusually, they were sitting apart from everyone else and conversing in low voices
	ron led the way over to them
	it's a bummer, all right, george was saying gloomily to fred
	but if he won't talk to us in person, we'll have to send him the letter after all
	or we'll stuff it into his hand
	he can't avoid us forrever
	who's avoiding you said ron, sitting down next to them
	wish you would, said fred, looking irritated at the interruption
	what's a bummer ron asked george
	having a nosy git like you for a brother, said george
	you two got any ideas on the triwizard tournament yet  harry asked
	thought any more about trying to enteri asked mcgonagall how the champions are chosen but she wasn't telling, said george bitterly
	she just told me to shut up and get on with transfiguring my raccoon
	wonder what the tasks are going to be  said ron thoughtfully
	you know, i bet we could do them, harry
	we've done dangerous stuff before
	not in front of a panel of judges, you haven't, said fred
	mcgonagall says the champions get awarded points according to how well they've done the tasks
	who are the judges harry asked
	well, the heads of the participating schools are always on the panel, said hermione, and everyone looked around at her, rather surprised, because all three of them were injured during the tournament of 1792, when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage
	she noticed them all looking at her and said, with her usual air of impatience that nobody else had read all the books she had, it's all in hogwarts, a history
	though, of course, that book's not entirely reliable
	a revised history of hogwarts would be a more accurate title
	or a highly biased and selective history of hogwarts, which glosses over the nastier aspects of the school
	what are you on about said ron, though harry thought he knew what was coming
	houseelves said hermione, her eyes flashing
	not once, in over a thousand pages, does hogwarts, a history mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slavesharry shook his head and applied himself to his scrambled eggs
	his and ron's lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb hermione's determination to pursue justice for houseelves
	true, both of them had paid two sickles for a s
	badge, but they had only done it to keep her quiet
	their sickles had been wasted, however if anything, they seemed to have made hermione more vociferous
	she had been badgering harry and ron ever since, first to wear the badges, then to persuade others to do the same, and she had also taken to rattling around the gryffindor common room every evening, cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses
	you do realize that your sheets are changed, your fires lit, your classrooms cleaned, and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid and enslaved  she kept saying fiercely
	some people, like neville, had paid up just to stop hermione from glowering at them
	a few seemed mildly interested in what she had to say, but were reluctant to take a more active role in campaigning
	many regarded the whole thing as a joke
	ron now rolled his eyes at the ceiling, which was flooding them all in autumn sunlight, and fred became extremely interested in his bacon both twins had refused to buy a s
	george, however, leaned in toward hermione
	listen, have you ever been down in the kitchens, hermioneno, of course not, said hermione curtly, i hardly think students are supposed to well, we have, said george, indicating fred, loads of times, to nick food
	and we've met them, and they're happy
	they think they've got the best job in the world that's because they're uneducated and brainwashed  hermione began hotly, but her next few words were drowned out by the sudden whooshing noise from overhead, which announced the arrival of the post owls
	harry looked up at once, and saw hedwig soaring toward him
	hermione stopped talking abruptly she and ron watched hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto harry's shoulder, folded her wings, and held out her leg wearily
	harry pulled off sirius's reply and offered hedwig his bacon rinds, which she ate gratefully
	then, checking that fred and george were safely immersed in further discussions about the triwizard tournament, harry read out sirius's letter in a whisper to ron and hermione
	i'm back in the country and well hidden
	i want you to keep me posted on everything that's going on at hogwarts
	don't use hedwig, keep changing owls, and don't worry about me, just watch out for yourself don't forget what i said about your scar
	siriuswhy d'you have to keep changing owls  ron asked in a low voice
	hedwig'll attract too much attention, said hermione at once
	a snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he's hiding
	i mean, they're not native birds, are theyharry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his robes, wondering whether he felt more or less worried than before
	he supposed that sirius managing to get back without being caught was something
	he couldn't deny either that the idea that sirius was much nearer was reassuring at least he wouldn't have to wait so long for a response every time he wrote
	thanks, hedwig, he said, stroking her
	she hooted sleepily, dipped her beak briefly into his goblet of orange juice, then took off again, clearly desperate for a good long sleep in the owlery
	there was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day
	nobody was very attentive in lessons, being much more interested in the arrival that evening of the people from beauxbatons and durmstrang even potions was more bearable than usual, as it was half an hour shorter
	when the bell rang early, harry, ron, and hermione hurried up to gryffindor tower, deposited their bags and books as they had been instructed, pulled on their cloaks, and rushed back downstairs into the entrance hall
	the heads of houses were ordering their students into lines
	weasley, straighten your hat, professor mcgonagall snapped at ron
	miss patil, take that ridiculous thing out of your hair
	parvati scowled and removed a large ornamental butterfly from the end of her plait
	follow me, please, said professor mcgonagall
	first years in front
	they filed down the steps and lined up in front of the castle
	it was a cold, clear evening dusk was falling and a pale, transparentlooking moon was already shining over the forbidden forest
	harry, standing between ron and hermione in the fourth row from the front, saw dennis creevey positively shivering with anticipation among the other first years
	nearly six, said ron, checking his watch and then staring down the drive that led to the front gates
	how d'you reckon they're coming  the traini doubt it, said hermione
	how, then  broomsticks  harry suggested, looking up at the starry sky
	not from that far away
	a portkey ron suggested
	or they could apparate  maybe you're allowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come fromyou can't apparate inside the hogwarts grounds, how often do i have to tell you said hermione impatiently
	they scanned the darkening grounds excitedly, but nothing was moving everything was still, silent, and quite as usual
	harry was starting to feel cold
	he wished they'd hurry up
	maybe the foreign students were preparing a dramatic entrance
	he remembered what mr
	weasley had said back at the campsite before the quidditch world cup  always the same  we can't resist showing off when we get together
	and then dumbledore called out from the back row where he stood with the other teachers  aha  unless i am very much mistaken, the delegation from beauxbatons approacheswhere said many students eagerly, all looking in different directions
	there yelled a sixth year, pointing over the forest
	something large, much larger than a broomstick  or, indeed, a hundred broomsticks  was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle, growing larger all the time
	it's a dragon  shrieked one of the first years, losing her head completely
	it's a flying house  said dennis creevey
	dennis's guess was closer
	as the gigantic black shape skimmed over the treetops of the forbidden forest and the lights shining from the castle windows hit it, they saw a gigantic, powderblue, horsedrawn carriage, the size of a large house, soaring toward them, pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses, all palominos, and each the size of an elephant
	the front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage hurtled ever lower, coming in to land at a tremendous speed  then, with an almighty crash that made neville jump backward onto a slytherin fifth year's foot, the horses' hooves, larger than dinner plates, hit the ground
	a second later, the carriage landed too, bouncing upon its vast wheels, while the golden horses tossed their enormous heads and rolled large, fiery red eyes
	harry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a coat of arms two crossed, golden wands, each emitting three stars before it opened
	a boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage, bent forward, fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor, and unfolded a set of golden steps
	he sprang back respectfully
	then harry saw a shining, highheeled black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage  a shoe the size of a child's sled  followed, almost immediately, by the largest woman he had ever seen in his life
	the size of the carriage, and of the horses, was immediately explained
	a few people gasped
	harry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life, and that was hagrid he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights
	yet somehow  maybe simply because he was used to hagrid  this woman now at the foot of the steps, and looking around at the waiting, wideeyed crowd seemed even more unnaturally large
	as she stepped into the light flooding from the entrance hall, she was revealed to have a handsome, oliveskinned face large, black, liquidlooking eyes and a rather beaky nose
	her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at the base of her neck
	she was dressed from head to foot in black satin, and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers
	dumbledore started to clap the students, following his lead, broke into applause too, many of them standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman
	her face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward dumbledore, extending a glittering hand
	dumbledore, though tall himself, had barely to bend to kiss it
	my dear madame maxime, he said
	dumblydort, said madame maxime in a deep voice
	i 'ope i find you wellin excellent form, i thank you, said dumbledore
	my pupils, said madame maxime, waving one of her enormous hands carelessly behind her
	harry, whose attention had been focused completely upon madame maxime, now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls, all, by the look of them, in their late teens, had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind madame maxime
	they were shivering, which was unsurprising, given that their robes seemed to be made of fine silk, and none of them were wearing cloaks
	a few had wrapped scarves and shawls around their heads
	from what harry could see of them they were standing in madame maxime's enormous shadow, they were staring up at hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their faces
	as karkaroff arrived yet  madame maxime asked
	he should be here any moment, said dumbledore
	would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle warm up, i think, said madame maxime
	but ze 'orses   our care of magical creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them, said dumbledore, the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other  er  charges
	skrewts, ron muttered to harry, grinning
	my steeds require  er  forceful 'andling, said madame maxime, looking as though she doubted whether any care of magical creatures teacher at hogwarts could be up to the job
	zey are very strong
	i assure you that hagrid will be well up to the job, said dumbledore, smiling
	very well, said madame maxime, bowing slightly
	will you please inform zis 'agrid zat ze 'orses drink only singlemalt whiskeyit will be attended to, said dumbledore, also bowing
	come, said madame maxime imperiously to her students, and the hogwarts crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone steps
	how big d'you reckon durmstrang's horses are going to be  seamus finnigan said, leaning around lavender and parvati to address harry and ron
	well, if they're any bigger than this lot, even hagrid won't be able to handle them, said harry
	that's if he hasn't been attacked by his skrewts
	wonder what's up with themmaybe they've escaped, said ron hopefully
	oh don't say that, said hermione with a shudder
	imagine that lot loose on the grounds
	they stood, shivering slightly now, waiting for the durmstrang party to arrive
	most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky
	for a few minutes, the silence was broken only by madame maxime's huge horses snorting and stamping
	but then  can you hear something  said ron suddenly
	harry listened a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward them from out of the darkness  a muffled rumbling and sucking sound, as though an immense vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbed
	the lake  yelled lee jordan, pointing down at it
	look at the lakefrom their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds, they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water  except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all
	some disturbance was taking place deep in the center great bubbles were forming on the surface, waves were now washing over the muddy banks  and then, out in the very middle of the lake, a whirlpool appeared, as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lake's floor
	what seemed to be a long, black pole began to rise slowly out of the heart of the whirlpool
	and then harry saw the rigging
	it's a mast  he said to ron and hermione
	slowly, magnificently, the ship rose out of the water, gleaming in the moonlight
	it had a strangely skeletal look about it, as though it were a resurrected wreck, and the dim, misty lights shimmering at its portholes looked like ghostly eyes
	finally, with a great sloshing noise, the ship emerged entirely, bobbing on the turbulent water, and began to glide toward the bank
	a few moments later, they heard the splash of an anchor being thrown down in the shallows, and the thud of a plank being lowered onto the bank
	people were disembarking they could see their silhouettes passing the lights in the ship's portholes
	all of them, harry noticed, seemed to be built along the lines of crabbe and goyle
	but then, as they drew nearer, walking up the lawns into the light streaming from the entrance hall, he saw that their bulk was really due to the fact that they were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy, matted fur
	but the man who was leading them up to the castle was wearing furs of a different sort sleek and silver, like his hair
	dumbledore he called heartily as he walked up the slope
	how are you, my dear fellow, how are youblooming, thank you, professor karkaroff, dumbledore replied
	karkaroff had a fruity, unctuous voice when he stepped into the light pouring from the front doors of the castle they saw that he was tall and thin like dumbledore, but his white hair was short, and his goatee finishing in a small curl did not entirely hide his rather weak chin
	when he reached dumbledore, he shook hands with both of his own
	dear old hogwarts, he said, looking up at the castle and smiling his teeth were rather yellow, and harry noticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes, which remained cold and shrewd
	how good it is to be here, how good
	viktor, come along, into the warmth
	you don't mind, dumbledore  viktor has a slight head cold
	karkaroff beckoned forward one of his students
	as the boy passed, harry caught a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows
	he didn't need the punch on the arm ron gave him, or the hiss in his ear, to recognize that profile
	harry  it's krumchapter sixteen  the goblet of firei don't believe it ron said, in a stunned voice, as the hogwarts students filed back up the steps behind the party from durmstrang
	krum, harry  viktor krumfor heaven's sake, ron, he's only a quidditch player, said hermione
	only a quidditch player  ron said, looking at her as though he couldn't believe his ears
	hermione  he's one of the best seekers in the world  i had no idea he was still at schoolas they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of the hogwarts students heading for the great hall, harry saw lee jordan jumping up and down on the soles of his feet to get a better look at the back of krum's head
	several sixthyear girls were frantically searching their pockets as they walked  oh i don't believe it, i haven't got a single quill on me d'you think he'd sign my hat in lipstickreally, hermione said loftily as they passed the girls, now squabbling over the lipstick
	i'm getting his autograph if i can, said ron
	you haven't got a quill, have you, harrynope, they're upstairs in my bag, said harry
	they walked over to the gryffindor table and sat down
	ron took care to sit on the side facing the doorway, because krum and his fellow durmstrang students were still gathered around it, apparently unsure about where they should sit
	the students from beauxbatons had chosen seats at the ravenclaw table
	they were looking around the great hall with glum expressions on their faces
	three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads
	it's not that cold, said hermione defensively
	why didn't they bring cloaksover here come and sit over here  ron hissed
	over here hermione, budge up, make a space whattoo late, said ron bitterly
	viktor krum and his fellow durmstrang students had settled themselves at the slytherin table
	harry could see malfoy, crabbe, and goyle looking very smug about this
	as he watched, malfoy bent forward to speak to krum
	yeah, that's right, smarm up to him, malfoy, said ron scathingly
	i bet krum can see right through him, though
	bet he gets people fawning over him all the time
	where d'you reckon they're going to sleep  we could offer him a space in our dormitory, harry
	i wouldn't mind giving him my bed, i could kip on a camp bed
	they look a lot happier than the beauxbatons lot, said harry
	the durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy furs and looking up at the starry black ceiling with expressions of interest a couple of them were picking up the golden plates and goblets and examining them, apparently impressed
	up at the staff table, filch, the caretaker, was adding chairs
	he was wearing his moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion
	harry was surprised to see that he added four chairs, two on either side of dumbledore's
	but there are only two extra people, harry said
	why's filch putting out four chairs, who else is comingeh  said ron vaguely
	he was still staring avidly at krum
	when all the students had entered the hall and settled down at their house tables, the staff entered, filing up to the top table and taking their seats
	last in line were professor dumbledore, professor karkaroff, and madame maxime
	when their headmistress appeared, the pupils from beauxbatons leapt to their feet
	a few of the hogwarts students laughed
	the beauxbatons party appeared quite unembarrassed, however, and did not resume their seats until madame maxime had sat down on dumbledore's lefthand side
	dumbledore remained standing, and a silence fell over the great hall
	good evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and  most particularly  guests, said dumbledore, beaming around at the foreign students
	i have great pleasure in welcoming you all to hogwarts
	i hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable
	one of the beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave what was unmistakably a derisive laugh
	no one's making you stay  hermione whispered, bristling at her
	the tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast, said dumbledore
	i now invite you all to eat, drink, and make yourselves at homehe sat down, and harry saw karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him in conversation
	the plates in front of them filled with food as usual
	the houseelves in the kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops there was a greater variety of dishes in front of them than harry had ever seen, including several that were definitely foreign
	what's that said ron, pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish stew that stood beside a large steakandkidney pudding
	bouillabaisse, said hermione
	it's french, said hermione, i had it on holiday summer before last
	i'll take your word for it, said ron, helping himself to black pudding
	the great hall seemed somehow much more crowded than usual, even though there were barely twenty additional students there perhaps it was because their differently colored uniforms stood out so clearly against the black of the hogwarts' robes
	now that they had removed their furs, the durmstrang students were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep bloodred
	hagrid sidled into the hall through a door behind the staff table twenty minutes after the start of the feast
	he slid into his seat at the end and waved at harry, ron, and hermione with a very heavily bandaged hand
	skrewts doing all right, hagrid harry called
	thrivin', hagrid called back happily
	yeah, i'll just bet they are, said ron quietly
	looks like they've finally found a food they like, doesn't it  hagrid's fingers
	at that moment, a voice said, excuse me, are you wanting ze bouillabaisseit was the girl from beauxbatons who had laughed during dumbledore's speech
	she had finally removed her muffler
	a long sheet of silveryblonde hair fell almost to her waist
	she had large, deep blue eyes, and very white, even teeth
	he stared up at her, opened his mouth to reply, but nothing came out except a faint gurgling noise
	yeah, have it, said harry, pushing the dish toward the girl
	you 'ave finished wiz ityeah, ron said breathlessly
	yeah, it was excellent
	the girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off to the ravenclaw table
	ron was still goggling at the girl as though he had never seen one before
	harry started to laugh
	the sound seemed to jog ron back to his senses
	she's a veela  he said hoarsely to harry
	of course she isn't said hermione tartly
	i don't see anyone else gaping at her like an idiotbut she wasn't entirely right about that
	as the girl crossed the hall, many boys' heads turned, and some of them seemed to have become temporarily speechless, just like ron
	i'm telling you, that's not a normal girl said ron, leaning sideways so he could keep a clear view of her
	they don't make them like that at hogwartsthey make them okay at hogwarts, said harry without thinking
	cho happened to be sitting only a few places away from the girl with the silvery hair
	when you've both put your eyes back in, said hermione briskly, you'll be able to see who's just arrived
	she was pointing up at the staff table
	the two remaining empty seats had just been filled
	ludo bagman was now sitting on professor karkaroff's other side, while mr
	crouch, percy's boss, was next to madame maxime
	what are they doing here said harry in surprise
	they organized the triwizard tournament, didn't they said hermione
	i suppose they wanted to be here to see it start
	when the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar desserts too
	ron examined an odd sort of pale blancmange closely, then moved it carefully a few inches to his right, so that it would be clearly visible from the ravenclaw table
	the girl who looked like a veela appeared to have eaten enough, however, and did not come over to get it
	once the golden plates had been wiped clean, dumbledore stood up again
	a pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the hall now
	harry felt a slight thrill of excitement, wondering what was coming
	several seats down from them, fred and george were leaning forward, staring at dumbledore with great concentration
	the moment has come, said dumbledore, smiling around at the sea of upturned faces
	the triwizard tournament is about to start
	i would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket  the what harry muttered
	just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year
	but first, let me introduce, for those who do not know them, mr
	bartemius crouch, head of the department of international magical cooperation  there was a smattering of polite applause  and mr
	ludo bagman, head of the department of magical games and sports
	there was a much louder round of applause for bagman than for crouch, perhaps because of his fame as a beater, or simply because he looked so much more likable
	he acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand
	bartemius crouch did not smile or wave when his name was announced
	remembering him in his neat suit at the quidditch world cup, harry thought he looked strange in wizard's robes
	his toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd next to dumbledore's long white hair and beard
	crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the triwizard tournament, dumbledore continued, and they will be joining myself, professor karkaroff, and madame maxime on the panel that will judge the champions' efforts
	at the mention of the word champions, the attentiveness of the listening students seemed to sharpen
	perhaps dumbledore had noticed their sudden stillness, for he smiled as he said, the casket, then, if you please, mr
	filch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the hall, now approached dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels
	it looked extremely old
	a murmur of excited interest rose from the watching students dennis creevey actually stood on his chair to see it properly, but, being so tiny, his head hardly rose above anyone else's
	the instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by mr
	bagman, said dumbledore as filch placed the chest carefully on the table before him, and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge
	there will be three tasks, spaced throughout the school year, and they will test the champions in many different ways
	their magical prowess  their daring  their powers of deduction  and, of course, their ability to cope with danger
	at this last word, the hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody seemed to be breathing
	as you know, three champions compete in the tournament, dumbledore went on calmly, one from each of the participating schools
	they will be marked on how well they perform each of the tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the triwizard cup
	the champions will be chosen by an impartial selector  the goblet of fire
	dumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of the casket
	the lid creaked slowly open
	dumbledore reached inside it and pulled out a large, roughly hewn wooden cup
	it would have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing bluewhite flames
	dumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it, where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the hall
	anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet, said dumbledore
	aspiring champions have twentyfour hours in which to put their names forward
	tomorrow night, halloween, the goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools
	the goblet will be placed in the entrance hall tonight, where it will be freely accessible to all those wishing to compete
	to ensure that no underage student yields to temptation, said dumbledore, i will be drawing an age line around the goblet of fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall
	nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line
	finally, i wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly
	once a champion has been selected by the goblet of fire, he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end
	the placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding, magical contract
	there can be no change of heart once you have become a champion
	please be very sure, therefore, that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet
	now, i think it is time for bed
	good night to you all
	an age line  fred weasley said, his eyes glinting, as they all made their way across the hall to the doors into the entrance hall
	well, that should be fooled by an aging potion, shouldn't it  and once your name's in that goblet, you're laughing  it can't tell whether you're seventeen or notbut i don't think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance, said hermione, we just haven't learned enough
	speak for yourself, said george shortly
	you'll try and get in, won't you, harryharry thought briefly of dumbledore's insistence that nobody under seventeen should submit their name, but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the triwizard tournament filled his mind again
	he wondered how angry dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get over the age line
	where is he said ron, who wasn't listening to a word of this conversation, but looking through the crowd to see what had become of krum
	dumbledore didn't say where the durmstrang people are sleeping, did hebut this query was answered almost instantly they were level with the slytherin table now, and karkaroff had just bustled up to his students
	back to the ship, then, he was saying
	viktor, how are you feeling  did you eat enough  should i send for some mulled wine from the kitchensharry saw krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on
	professor, ivood like some vine, said one of the other durmstrang boys hopefully
	i wasn't offering it to you, poliakoff, snapped karkaroff, his warmly paternal air vanishing in an instant
	i notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again, disgusting boy karkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors, reaching them at exactly the same moment as harry, ron, and hermione
	harry stopped to let him walk through first
	thank you, said karkaroff carelessly, glancing at him
	and then karkaroff froze
	he turned his head back to harry and stared at him as though he couldn't believe his eyes
	behind their headmaster, the students from durmstrang came to a halt too
	karkaroff's eyes moved slowly up harry's face and fixed upon his scar
	the durmstrang students were staring curiously at harry too
	out of the corner of his eye, harry saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces
	the boy with food all down his front nudged the girl next to him and pointed openly at harry's forehead
	yeah, that's harry potter, said a growling voice from behind them
	professor karkaroff spun around
	madeye moody was standing there, leaning heavily on his staff, his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the durmstrang headmaster
	the color drained from karkaroff's face as harry watched
	a terrible look of mingled fury and fear came over him
	you he said, staring at moody as though unsure he was really seeing him
	me, said moody grimly
	and unless you've got anything to say to potter, karkaroff, you might want to move
	you're blocking the doorway
	it was true half the students in the hall were now waiting behind them, looking over one another's shoulders to see what was causing the holdup
	without another word, professor karkaroff swept his students away with him
	moody watched him until he was out of sight, his magical eye fixed upon his back, a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face
	as the next day was saturday, most students would normally have breakfasted late
	harry, ron, and hermione, however, were not alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends
	when they went down into the entrance hall, they saw about twenty people milling around it, some of them eating toast, all examining the goblet of fire
	it had been placed in the center of the hall on the stool that normally bore the sorting hat
	a thin golden line had been traced on the floor, forming a circle ten feet around it in every direction
	anyone put their name in yet  ron asked a thirdyear girl eagerly
	all the durmstrang lot, she replied
	but i haven't seen anyone from hogwarts yet
	bet some of them put it in last night after we'd all gone to bed, said harry
	i would've if it had been me
	wouldn't have wanted everyone watching
	what if the goblet just gobbed you right back out againsomeone laughed behind harry
	turning, he saw fred, george, and lee jordan hurrying down the staircase, all three of them looking extremely excited
	done it, fred said in a triumphant whisper to harry, ron, and hermione
	the aging potion, dung brains, said fred
	one drop each, said george, rubbing his hands together with glee
	we only need to be a few months older
	we're going to split the thousand galleons between the three of us if one of us wins, said lee, grinning broadly
	i'm not sure this is going to work, you know, said hermione warningly
	i'm sure dumbledore will have thought of this
	fred, george, and lee ignored her
	ready  fred said to the other two, quivering with excitement
	c'mon, then  i'll go first harry watched, fascinated, as fred pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket bearing the words fred weasley  hogwarts
	fred walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there, rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a fiftyfoot drop
	then, with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him, he took a great breath and stepped over the line
	for a split second harry thought it had worked  george certainly thought so, for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after fred  but next moment, there was a loud sizzling sound, and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible shotputter
	they landed painfully, ten feet away on the cold stone floor, and to add insult to injury, there was a loud popping noise, and both of them sprouted identical long white beards
	the entrance hall rang with laughter
	even fred and george joined in, once they had gotten to their feet and taken a good look at each other's beards
	i did warn you, said a deep, amused voice, and everyone turned to see professor dumbledore coming out of the great hall
	he surveyed fred and george, his eyes twinkling
	i suggest you both go up to madam pomfrey
	she is already tending to miss fawcett, of ravenclaw, and mr
	summers, of hufflepuff, both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too
	though i must say, neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours
	fred and george set off for the hospital wing, accompanied by lee, who was howling with laughter, and harry, ron, and hermione, also chortling, went in to breakfast
	the decorations in the great hall had changed this morning
	as it was halloween, a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling, while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner
	harry led the way over to dean and seamus, who were discussing those hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering
	there's a rumor going around that warrington got up early and put his name in, dean told harry
	that big bloke from slytherin who looks like a sloth
	harry, who had played quidditch against warrington, shook his head in disgust
	we can't have a slytherin championand all the hufflepuffs are talking about diggory, said seamus contemptuously
	but i wouldn't have thought he'd have wanted to risk his good looks
	listen said hermione suddenly
	people were cheering out in the entrance hall
	they all swiveled around in their seats and saw angelina johnson coming into the hall, grinning in an embarrassed sort of way
	a tall black girl who played chaser on the gryffindor quidditch team, angelina came over to them, sat down, and said, well, i've done it  just put my name inyou're kidding said ron, looking impressed
	are you seventeen, then asked harry
	course she is, can't see a beard, can you said ron
	i had my birthday last week, said angelina
	well, i'm glad someone from gryffindor's entering, said hermione
	i really hope you get it, angelinathanks, hermione, said angelina, smiling at her
	yeah, better you than prettyboy diggory, said seamus, causing several hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at him
	what're we going to do today, then  ron asked harry and hermione when they had finished breakfast and were leaving the great hall
	we haven't been down to visit hagrid yet, said harry
	okay, said ron, just as long as he doesn't ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts
	a look of great excitement suddenly dawned on hermione's face
	i've just realized  i haven't asked hagrid to join s
	yet  she said brightly
	wait for me, will you, while i nip upstairs and get the badgeswhat is it with her  said ron, exasperated, as hermione ran away up the marble staircase
	hey, ron, said harry suddenly
	the students from beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the grounds, among them, the veelagirl
	those gathered around the goblet of fire stood back to let them pass, watching eagerly
	madame maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them into a line
	one by one, the beauxbatons students stepped across the age line and dropped their slips of parchment into the bluewhite flames
	as each name entered the fire, it turned briefly red and emitted sparks
	what d'you reckon'll happen to the ones who aren't chosen  ron muttered to harry as the veelagirl dropped her parchment into the goblet of fire
	reckon they'll go back to school, or hang around to watch the tournamentdunno, said harry
	hang around, i suppose
	madame maxime's staying to judge, isn't she when all the beauxbatons students had submitted their names, madame maxime led them back out of the hall and out onto the grounds again
	where are they sleeping, then  said ron, moving toward the front doors and staring after them
	a loud rattling noise behind them announced hermione's reappearance with the box of s
	oh good, hurry up, said ron, and he jumped down the stone steps, keeping his eyes on the back of the veelagirl, who was now halfway across the lawn with madame maxime
	as they neared hagrid's cabin on the edge of the forbidden forest, the mystery of the beauxbatons' sleeping quarters was solved
	the gigantic powderblue carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from hagrid's front door, and the students were climbing back inside it
	the elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it
	harry knocked on hagrid's door, and fang's booming barks answered instantly
	bout time  said hagrid, when he'd flung open the door
	thought you lot'd forgotten where i livewe've been really busy, hag  hermione started to say, but then she stopped dead, looking up at hagrid, apparently lost for words
	hagrid was wearing his best and very horrible hairy brown suit, plus a checked yellowandorange tie
	this wasn't the worst of it, though he had evidently tried to tame his hair, using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease
	it was now slicked down into two bunches  perhaps he had tried a ponytail like bill's, but found he had too much hair
	the look didn't really suit hagrid at all
	for a moment, hermione goggled at him, then, obviously deciding not to comment, she said, erm  where are the skrewts
	out by the pumpkin patch, said hagrid happily
	they're gettin' massive, mus' be nearly three foot long now
	on'y trouble is, they've started killin' each other
	oh no, really  said hermione, shooting a repressive look at ron, who, staring at hagrid's odd hairstyle, had just opened his mouth to say something about it
	yeah, said hagrid sadly
	s' okay, though, i've got 'em in separate boxes now
	still got abou' twenty
	well, that's lucky, said ron
	hagrid missed the sarcasm
	hagrid's cabin comprised a single room, in one corner of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt
	a similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling
	they sat down at the table while hagrid started to make tea, and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the triwizard tournament
	hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were
	you wait, he said, grinning
	yer going ter see some stuff yeh've never seen before
	ah, but i'm not supposed ter say
	go on, hagrid harry, ron, and hermione urged him, but he just shook his head, grinning
	i don' want ter spoil it fer yeh, said hagrid
	but it's gonna be spectacular, i'll tell yeh that
	them champions're going ter have their work cut out
	never thought i'd live ter see the triwizard tournament played againthey ended up having lunch with hagrid, though they didn't eat much  hagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole, but after hermione unearthed a large talon in hers, she, harry, and ron rather lost their appetites
	however, they enjoyed themselves trying to make hagrid tell them what the tasks in the tournament were going to be, speculating which of the entrants were likely to be selected as champions, and wondering whether fred and george were beardless yet
	a light rain had started to fall by midafternoon it was very cozy sitting by the fire, listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window, watching hagrid darning his socks and arguing with hermione about houseelves  for he flatly refused to join s
	when she showed him her badges
	it'd be doin' 'em an unkindness, hermione, he said gravely, threading a massive bone needle with thick yellow yarn
	it's in their nature ter look after humans, that's what they like, see yeh'd be makin' 'em unhappy ter take away their work, an' insutin' 'em if yeh tried ter pay 'em
	but harry set dobby free, and he was over the moon about it  said hermione
	and we heard he's asking for wages nowyeah, well, yeh get weirdos in every breed
	i'm not sayin' there isn't the odd elf who'd take freedom, but yeh'll never persuade most of 'em ter do it  no, nothin' doin', hermione
	hermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of badges back into her cloak pocket
	by half past five it was growing dark, and ron, harry, and hermione decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the halloween feast  and, more important, the announcement of the school champions
	i'll come with yeh, said hagrid, putting away his darning
	hagrid got up, went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed, and began searching for something inside it
	they didn't pay too much attention until a truly horrible smell reached their nostrils
	coughing, ron said, hagrid, what's thateh said hagrid, turning around with a large bottle in his hand
	don' yeh like itis that aftershave said hermione in a slightly choked voice
	er  eau de cologne, hagrid muttered
	maybe it's a bit much, he said gruffly
	i'll go take it off, hang on
	he stumped out of the cabin, and they saw him washing himself vigorously in the water barrel outside the window
	eau de cologne said hermione in amazement
	hagridand what's with the hair and the suit said harry in an undertone
	look said ron suddenly, pointing out of the window
	hagrid had just straightened up and turned 'round
	if he had been blushing before, it was nothing to what he was doing now
	getting to their feet very cautiously, so that hagrid wouldn't spot them, harry, ron, and hermione peered through the window and saw that madame maxime and the beauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage, clearly about to set off for the feast too
	they couldn't hear what hagrid was saying, but he was talking to madame maxime with a rapt, mistyeyed expression harry had only ever seen him wear once before  when he had been looking at the baby dragon, norbert
	he's going up to the castle with her  said hermione indignantly
	i thought he was waiting for uswithout so much as a backward glance at his cabin, hagrid was trudging off up the grounds with madame maxime, the beauxbatons students following in their wake, jogging to keep up with their enormous strides
	he fancies her  said ron incredulously
	well, if they end up having children, they'll be setting a world record  bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton
	they let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them
	it was surprisingly dark outside
	drawing their cloaks more closely around themselves, they set off up the sloping lawns
	ooh it's them, look hermione whispered
	the durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle from the lake
	viktor krum was walking side by side with karkaroff, and the other durmstrang students were straggling along behind them
	ron watched krum excitedly, but krum did not look around as he reached the front doors a little ahead of hermione, ron, and harry and proceeded through them
	when they entered the candlelit great hall it was almost full
	the goblet of fire had been moved it was now standing in front of dumbledore's empty chair at the teachers' table
	fred and george  cleanshaven again  seemed to have taken their disappointment fairly well
	hope it's angelina, said fred as harry, ron, and hermione sat down
	so do i  said hermione breathlessly
	well, we'll soon knowthe halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual
	perhaps because it was their second feast in two days, harry didn't seem to fancy the extravagantly prepared food as much as he would have normally
	like everyone else in the hall, judging by the constantly craning necks, the impatient expressions on every face, the fidgeting, and the standing up to see whether dumbledore had finished eating yet, harry simply wanted the plates to clear, and to hear who had been selected as champions
	at long last, the golden plates returned to their original spotless state there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the hall, which died away almost instantly as dumbledore got to his feet
	on either side of him, professor karkaroff and madame maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone
	ludo bagman was beaming and winking at various students
	crouch, however, looked quite uninterested, almost bored
	well, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision, said dumbledore
	i estimate that it requires one more minute
	now, when the champions' names are called, i would ask them please to come up to the top of the hall, walk along the staff table, and go through into the next chamber  he indicated the door behind the staff table  where they will be receiving their first instructions
	he took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it at once, all the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished, plunging them into a state of semidarkness
	the goblet of fire now shone more brightly than anything in the whole hall, the sparkling bright, blueywhiteness of the flames almost painful on the eyes
	everyone watched, waiting
	a few people kept checking their watches
	any second, lee jordan whispered, two seats away from harry
	the flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again
	sparks began to fly from it
	next moment, a tongue of flame shot into the air, a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it  the whole room gasped
	dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at arm's length, so that he could read it by the light of the flames, which had turned back to bluewhite
	the champion for durmstrang, he read, in a strong, clear voice, will be viktor krum
	no surprises there  yelled ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept the hall
	harry saw viktor krum rise from the slytherin table and slouch up toward dumbledore he turned right, walked along the staff table, and disappeared through the door into the next chamber
	bravo, viktor boomed karkaroff, so loudly that everyone could hear him, even over all the applause
	knew you had it in youthe clapping and chatting died down
	now everyone's attention was focused again on the goblet, which, seconds later, turned red once more
	a second piece of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames
	the champion for beauxbatons, said dumbledore, is fleur delacourit's her, ron  harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up between the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables
	oh look, they're all disappointed, hermione said over the noise, nodding toward the remainder of the beauxbatons party
	disappointed was a bit of an understatement, harry thought
	two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms
	when fleur delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell again, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it
	the hogwarts champion next
	and the goblet of fire turned red once more sparks showered out of it the tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip dumbledore pulled the third piece of parchment
	the hogwarts champion, he called, is cedric diggoryno  said ron loudly, but nobody heard him except harry the uproar from the next table was too great
	every single hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet, screaming and stamping, as cedric made his way past them, grinning broadly, and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers' table
	indeed, the applause for cedric went on so long that it was some time before dumbledore could make himself heard again
	excellent dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down
	well, we now have our three champions
	i am sure i can count upon all of you, including the remaining students from beauxbatons and durmstrang, to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster
	by cheering your champion on, you will contribute in a very real but dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking, and it was apparent to everybody what had distracted him
	the fire in the goblet had just turned red again
	sparks were flying out of it
	a long flame shot suddenly into the air, and borne upon it was another piece of parchment
	automatically, it seemed, dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the parchment
	he held it out and stared at the name written upon it
	there was a long pause, during which dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands, and everyone in the room stared at dumbledore
	and then dumbledore cleared his throat and read out  harry potter
	chapter seventeen  the four championsharry sat there, aware that every head in the great hall had turned to look at him
	he was surely dreaming
	he had not heard correctly
	there was no applause
	a buzzing, as though of angry bees, was starting to fill the hall some students were standing up to get a better look at harry as he sat, frozen, in his seat
	up at the top table, professor mcgonagall had got to her feet and swept past ludo bagman and professor karkaroff to whisper urgently to professor dumbledore, who bent his ear toward her, frowning slightly
	harry turned to ron and hermione beyond them, he saw the long gryffindor table all watching him, openmouthed
	i didn't put my name in, harry said blankly
	both of them stared just as blankly back
	at the top table, professor dumbledore had straightened up, nodding to professor mcgonagall
	harry potter  he called again
	harry  up here, if you pleasego on, hermione whispered, giving harry a slight push
	harry got to his feet, trod on the hem of his robes, and stumbled slightly
	he set off up the gap between the gryffindor and hufflepuff tables
	it felt like an immensely long walk the top table didn't seem to be getting any nearer at all, and he could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon him, as though each were a searchlight
	the buzzing grew louder and louder
	after what seemed like an hour, he was right in front of dumbledore, feeling the stares of all the teachers upon him
	through the door, harry, said dumbledore
	harry moved off along the teachers' table
	hagrid was seated right at the end
	he did not wink at harry, or wave, or give any of his usual signs of greeting
	he looked completely astonished and stared at harry as he passed like everyone else
	harry went through the door out of the great hall and found himself in a smaller room, lined with paintings of witches and wizards
	a handsome fire was roaring in the fireplace opposite him
	the faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he entered
	he saw a wizened witch flit out of the frame of her picture and into the one next to it, which contained a wizard with a walrus mustache
	the wizened witch started whispering in his ear
	viktor krum, cedric diggory, and fleur delacour were grouped around the fire
	they looked strangely impressive, silhouetted against the flames
	krum, hunchedup and brooding, was leaning against the mantelpiece, slightly apart from the other two
	cedric was standing with his hands behind his back, staring into the fire
	fleur delacour looked around when harry walked in and threw back her sheet of long, silvery hair
	do zey want us back in ze hallshe thought he had come to deliver a message
	harry didn't know how to explain what had just happened
	he just stood there, looking at the three champions
	it struck him how very tall all of them were
	there was a sound of scurrying feet behind him, and ludo bagman entered the room
	he took harry by the arm and led him forward
	extraordinary  he muttered, squeezing harry's arm
	absolutely extraordinary gentlemen
	lady, he added, approaching the fireside and addressing the other three
	may i introduce  incredible though it may seem  the fourth triwizard championviktor krum straightened up
	his surly face darkened as he surveyed harry
	cedric looked nonplussed
	he looked from bagman to harry and back again as though sure he must have misheard what bagman had said
	fleur delacour, however, tossed her hair, smiling, and said, oh, vairy funny joke, meester bagman
	joke bagman repeated, bewildered
	no, no, not at all  harry's name just came out of the goblet of firekrum's thick eyebrows contracted slightly
	cedric was still looking politely bewildered
	but evidently zair 'as been a mistake, she said contemptuously to bagman
	it is amazing, said bagman, rubbing his smooth chin and smiling down at harry
	but, as you know, the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure
	and as his name's come out of the goblet
	i mean, i don't think there can be any ducking out at this stage
	it's down in the rules, you're obliged
	harry will just have to do the best he the door behind them opened again, and a large group of people came in professor dumbledore, followed closely by mr
	crouch, professor karkaroff, madame maxime, professor mcgonagall, and professor snape
	harry heard the buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall, before professor mcgonagall closed the door
	madame maxime  said fleur at once, striding over to her headmistress
	zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete alsosomewhere under harry's numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger
	little boymadame maxime had drawn herself up to her full, and considerable, height
	the top of her handsome head brushed the candlefilled chandelier, and her gigantic blacksatin bosom swelled
	what is ze meaning of zis, dumblydorr  she said imperiously
	i'd rather like to know that myself, dumbledore, said professor karkaroff
	he was wearing a steely smile, and his blue eyes were like chips of ice
	two hogwarts champions  i don't remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions  or have i not read the rules carefully enoughhe gave a short and nasty laugh
	c'est impossible, said madame maxime, whose enormous hand with its many superb opals was resting upon fleur's shoulder
	ogwarts cannot 'ave two champions
	we were under the impression that your age line would keep out younger contestants, dumbledore, said karkaroff, his steely smile still in place, though his eyes were colder than ever
	otherwise, we would, of course, have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools
	it's no one's fault but potter's, karkaroff, said snape softly
	his black eyes were alight with malice
	don't go blaming dumbledore for potter's determination to break rules
	he has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here  thank you, severus, said dumbledore firmly, and snape went quiet, though his eyes still glinted malevolently through his curtain of greasy black hair
	professor dumbledore was now looking down at harry, who looked right back at him, trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the halfmoon spectacles
	did you put your name into the goblet of fire, harry  he asked calmly
	he was very aware of everybody watching him closely
	snape made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the shadows
	did you ask an older student to put it into the goblet of fire for you said professor dumbledore, ignoring snape
	no, said harry vehemently
	ah, but of course 'e is lying  cried madame maxime
	snape was now shaking his head, his lip curling
	he could not have crossed the age line, said professor mcgonagall sharply
	i am sure we are all agreed on that dumblydorr must 'ave made a mistake wiz ze line, said madame maxime, shrugging
	it is possible, of course, said dumbledore politely
	dumbledore, you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake said professor mcgonagall angrily
	really, what nonsense  harry could not have crossed the line himself, and as professor dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him, i'm sure that should be good enough for everybody elseshe shot a very angry look at professor snape
	bagman, said karkaroff, his voice unctuous once more, you are our  er  objective judges
	surely you will agree that this is most irregularbagman wiped his round, boyish face with his handkerchief and looked at mr
	crouch, who was standing outside the circle of the firelight, his face half hidden in shadow
	he looked slightly eerie, the half darkness making him look much older, giving him an almost skulllike appearance
	when he spoke, however, it was in his usual curt voice
	we must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the goblet of fire are bound to compete in the tournament
	well, barty knows the rule book back to front, said bagman, beaming and turning back to karkaroff and madame maxime, as though the matter was now closed
	i insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students, said karkaroff
	he had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now
	his face wore a very ugly look indeed
	you will set up the goblet of fire once more, and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions
	it's only fair, dumbledore
	but karkaroff, it doesn't work like that, said bagman
	the goblet of fire's just gone out  it won't reignite until the start of the next tournament  in which durmstrang will most certainly not be competing exploded karkaroff
	after all our meetings and negotiations and compromises, i little expected something of this nature to occur  i have half a mind to leave nowempty threat, karkaroff, growled a voice from near the door
	you can't leave your champion now
	he's got to compete
	they've all got to compete
	binding magical contract, like dumbledore said
	convenient, ehmoody had just entered the room
	he limped toward the fire, and with every right step he took, there was a loud clunk
	convenient said karkaroff
	i'm afraid i don't understand you, moody
	harry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as though what moody was saying was barely worth his notice, but his hands gave him away they had balled themselves into fists
	don't you said moody quietly
	it's very simple, karkaroff
	someone put potter's name in that goblet knowing he'd have to compete if it came out
	evidently, someone 'oo wished to give 'ogwarts two bites at ze apple said madame maxime
	i quite agree, madame maxime, said karkaroff, bowing to her
	i shall be lodging complaints with the ministry of magic and the international confederation of wizards if anyone's got reason to complain, it's potter, growled moody, but
	i don't hear him saying a word
	why should 'e complain burst out fleur delacour, stamping her foot
	e 'as ze chance to compete, 'asn't 'e we 'ave all been 'oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks  ze honor for our schools  a thousand galleons in prize money  zis is a chance many would die formaybe someone's hoping potter is going to die for it, said moody, with the merest trace of a growl
	an extremely tense silence followed these words
	ludo bagman, who was looking very anxious indeed, bounced nervously up and down on his feet and said, moody, old man
	what a thing to saywe all know professor moody considers the morning wasted if he hasn't discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime, said karkaroff loudly
	apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too
	an odd quality in a defense against the dark arts teacher, dumbledore, but no doubt you had your reasons
	imagining things, am i  growled moody
	seeing things, eh  it was a skilled witch or wizard who put the boy's name in that goblet
	ah, what evidence is zere of zat said madame maxime, throwing up her huge hands
	because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object  said moody
	it would have needed an exceptionally strong confundus charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament
	i'm guessing they submitted potter's name under a fourth school, to make sure he was the only one in his category
	you seem to have given this a great deal of thought, moody, said karkaroff coldly, and a very ingenious theory it is  though of course, i heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg, and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock
	so you'll understand if we don't take you entirely seriously
	there are those who'll turn innocent occasions to their advantage, moody retorted in a menacing voice
	it's my job to think the way dark wizards do, karkaroff  as you ought to remember
	alastor  said dumbledore warningly
	harry wondered for a moment whom he was speaking to, but then realized madeye could hardly be moody's real first name
	moody fell silent, though still surveying karkaroff with satisfaction  karkaroff's face was burning
	how this situation arose, we do not know, said dumbledore, speaking to everyone gathered in the room
	it seems to me, however, that we have no choice but to accept it
	both cedric and harry have been chosen to compete in the tournament
	this, therefore, they will do
	ah, but dumblydorr my dear madame maxime, if you have an alternative, i would be delighted to hear it
	dumbledore waited, but madame maxime did not speak, she merely glared
	she wasn't the only one either
	snape looked furious karkaroff livid bagman, however, looked rather excited
	well, shall we crack on, then  he said, rubbing his hands together and smiling around the room
	got to give our champions their instructions, haven't we  barty, want to do the honorsmr
	crouch seemed to come out of a deep reverie
	yes, he said, instructions
	he moved forward into the firelight
	close up, harry thought he looked ill
	there were dark shadows beneath his eyes and a thin, papery look about his wrinkled skin that had not been there at the quidditch world cup
	the first task is designed to test your daring, he told harry, cedric, fleur, and viktor, so we are not going to be telling you what it is
	courage in the face of the unknown is an important quality in a wizard
	the first task will take place on november the twentyfourth, in front of the other students and the panel of judges
	the champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament
	the champions will face the first challenge armed only with their wands
	they will receive information about the second task when the first is over
	owing to the demanding and timeconsuming nature of the tournament, the champions are exempted from endofyear tests
	crouch turned to look at dumbledore
	i think that's all, is it, albusi think so, said dumbledore, who was looking at mr
	crouch with mild concern
	are you sure you wouldn't like to stay at hogwarts tonight, bartyno, dumbledore, i must get back to the ministry, said mr
	it is a very busy, very difficult time at the moment
	i've left young weatherby in charge
	a little overenthusiastic, if truth be told
	you'll come and have a drink before you go, at least  said dumbledore
	come on, barry, i'm staying said bagman brightly
	it's all happening at hogwarts now, you know, much more exciting here than at the office i think not, ludo, said crouch with a touch of his old impatience
	professor karkaroff  madame maxime  a nightcap said dumbledore
	but madame maxime had already put her arm around fleur's shoulders and was leading her swiftly out of the room
	harry could hear them both talking very fast in french as they went off into the great hall
	karkaroff beckoned to krum, and they, too, exited, though in silence
	harry, cedric, i suggest you go up to bed, said dumbledore, smiling at both of them
	i am sure gryffindor and hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you, and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise
	harry glanced at cedric, who nodded, and they left together
	the great hall was deserted now the candles had burned low, giving the jagged smiles of the pumpkins an eerie, flickering quality
	so, said cedric, with a slight smile
	we're playing against each other againi s'pose, said harry
	he really couldn't think of anything to say
	the inside of his head seemed to be in complete disarray, as though his brain had been ransacked
	said cedric as they reached the entrance hall, which was now lit only by torches in the absence of the goblet of fire
	how did you get your name ini didn't, said harry, staring up at him
	i was telling the truth
	harry could tell cedric didn't believe him
	instead of going up the marble staircase, cedric headed for a door to its right
	harry stood listening to him going down the stone steps beyond it, then, slowly, he started to climb the marble ones
	was anyone except ron and hermione going to believe him, or would they all think he'd put himself in for the tournament  yet how could anyone think that, when he was facing competitors who'd had three years' more magical education than he had  when he was now facing tasks that not only sounded very dangerous, but which were to be performed in front of hundreds of people  yes, he'd thought about it
	he'd fantasized about it
	but it had been a joke, really, an idle sort of dream
	he'd never really, seriously considered entering
	but someone else had considered it
	someone else had wanted him in the tournament, and had made sure he was entered
	why  to give him a treat  he didn't think so, somehow
	to see him make a fool of himself  well, they were likely to get their wish
	but to get him killedwas moody just being his usual paranoid self  couldn't someone have put harry's name in the goblet as a trick, a practical joke  did anyone really want him deadharry was able to answer that at once
	yes, someone wanted him dead, someone had wanted him dead ever since he had been a year old
	but how could voldemort have ensured that harry's name got into the goblet of fire  voldemort was supposed to be far away, in some distant country, in hiding, alone
	feeble and powerless
	yet in that dream he had had, just before he had awoken with his scar hurting, voldemort had not been alone
	he had been talking to wormtail
	plotting harry's murder
	harry got a shock to find himself facing the fat lady already
	he had barely noticed where his feet were carrying him
	it was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame
	the wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbor's painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the fat lady
	she must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him
	both she and the fat lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest
	well, well, well, said the fat lady, violet's just told me everything
	who's just been chosen as school champion, thenbalderdash, said harry dully
	it most certainly isn't said the pale witch indignantly
	no, no, vi, it's the password, said the fat lady soothingly, and she swung forward on her hinges to let harry into the common room
	the blast of noise that met harry's ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward
	next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of gryffindor house, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling
	you should've told us you'd entered  bellowed fred he looked half annoyed, half deeply impressed
	how did you do it without getting a beard  brilliant  roared george
	i didn't, harry said
	i don't know how but angelina had now swooped down upon him oh if it couldn't be me, at least it's a gryffindor you'll be able to pay back diggory for that last quidditch match, harry  shrieked katie bell, another of the gryffindor chasers
	we've got food, harry, come and have some i'm not hungry, i had enough at the feast but nobody wanted to hear that he wasn't hungry nobody wanted to hear that he hadn't put his name in the goblet not one single person seemed to have noticed that he wasn't at all in the mood to celebrate
	lee jordan had unearthed a gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it around harry like a cloak
	harry couldn't get away whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks, forcing another butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands
	everyone wanted to know how he had done it, how he had tricked dumbledore's age line and managed to get his name into the goblet
	i didn't, he said, over and over again, i don't know how it happened
	but for all the notice anyone took, he might just as well not have answered at all
	i'm tired he bellowed finally, after nearly half an hour
	no, seriously, george  i'm going to bed he wanted more than anything to find ron and hermione, to find a bit of sanity, but neither of them seemed to be in the common room
	insisting that he needed to sleep, and almost flattening the little creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the foot of the stairs, harry managed to shake everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as he could
	to his great relief, he found ron was lying on his bed in the otherwise empty dormitory, still fully dressed
	he looked up when harry slammed the door behind him
	where've you been harry said
	he was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin
	harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet gryffindor banner that lee had tied around him
	he hastened to take it off, but it was knotted very tightly
	ron lay on the bed without moving, watching harry struggle to remove it
	so, he said, when harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a corner
	what d'you mean, congratulations said harry, staring at ron
	there was definitely something wrong with the way ron was smiling  it was more like a grimace
	no one else got across the age line, said ron
	not even fred and george
	what did you use  the invisibility cloakthe invisibility cloak wouldn't have got me over that line, said harry slowly
	i thought you might've told me if it was the cloak
	because it would've covered both of us, wouldn't it but you found another way, did youlisten, said harry, i didn't put my name in that goblet
	someone else must've done it
	ron raised his eyebrows
	what would they do that fori dunno, said harry
	he felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, to kill me
	ron's eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair
	it's okay, you know, you can tell me the truth, he said
	if you don't want everyone else to know, fine, but i don't know why you're bothering to lie, you didn't get into trouble for it, did you  that friend of the fat lady's, that violet, she's already told us all dumbledore's letting you enter
	a thousand galleons prize money, eh  and you don't have to do endofyear tests either
	i didn't put my name in that goblet said harry, starting to feel angry
	yeah, okay, said ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as cedric
	only you said this morning you'd have done it last night, and no one would've seen you
	i'm not stupid, you know
	you're doing a really good impression of it, harry snapped
	yeah said ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his face now
	you want to get to bed, harry
	i expect you'll need to be up early tomorrow for a photocall or something
	he wrenched the hangings shut around his fourposter, leaving harry standing there by the door, staring at the dark red velvet curtains, now hiding one of the few people he had been sure would believe him
	chapter eighteen  the weighing of the wandswhen harry woke up on sunday morning, it took him a moment to remember why he felt so miserable and worried
	then the memory of the previous night rolled over him
	he sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own fourposter, intending to talk to ron, to force ron to believe him  only to find that ron's bed was empty he had obviously gone down to breakfast
	harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room
	the moment he appeared, the people who had already finished breakfast broke into applause again
	the prospect of going down into the great hall and facing the rest of the gryffindors, all treating him like some sort of hero, was not inviting it was that, however, or stay here and allow himself to be cornered by the creevey brothers, who were both beckoning frantically to him to join them
	he walked resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed it open, climbed out of it, and found himself facetoface with hermione
	hello, she said, holding up a stack of toast, which she was carrying in a napkin
	want to go for a walkgood idea, said harry gratefully
	they went downstairs, crossed the entrance hall quickly without looking in at the great hall, and were soon striding across the lawn toward the lake, where the durmstrang ship was moored, reflected blackly in the water
	it was a chilly morning, and they kept moving, munching their toast, as harry told hermione exactly what had happened after he had left the gryffindor table the night before
	to his immense relief, hermione accepted his story without question
	well, of course i knew you hadn't entered yourself, she said when he'd finished telling her about the scene in the chamber off the hall
	the look on your face when dumbledore read out your name  but the question is, who did put it in  because moody's right, harry
	i don't think any student could have done it
	they'd never be able to fool the goblet, or get over dumbledore's have you seen ron harry interrupted
	he was at breakfast, she said
	does he still think i entered myselfwell
	no, i don't think so
	not really, said hermione awkwardly
	what's that supposed to mean, 'not really'oh harry, isn't it obvious hermione said despairingly
	he's jealousjealous harry said incredulously
	jealous of what  he wants to make a prat of himself in front of the whole school, does helook, said hermione patiently, it's always you who gets all the attention, you know it is
	i know it's not your fault, she added quickly, seeing harry open his mouth furiously
	i know you don't ask for it
	but  well  you know, ron's got all those brothers to compete against at home, and you're his best friend, and you're really famous  he's always shunted to one side whenever people see you, and he puts up with it, and he never mentions it, but i suppose this is just one time too many
	great, said harry bitterly
	tell him from me i'll swap any time he wants
	tell him from me he's welcome to it
	people gawping at my forehead everywhere i go
	i'm not teiling him anything, hermione said shortly
	it's the only way to sort this out
	i'm not running around after him trying to make him grow up  harry said, so loudly that several owls in a nearby tree took flight in alarm
	maybe he'll believe i'm not enjoying myself once i've got my neck broken or that's not funny, said hermione quietly
	that's not funny at all
	she looked extremely anxious
	harry, i've been thinking  you know what we've got to do, don't you straight away, the moment we get back to the castleyeah, give ron a good kick up the write to sirius
	you've got to tell him what's happened
	he asked you to keep him posted on everything that's going on at hogwarts
	it's almost as if he expected something like this to happen
	i brought some parchment and a quill out with me come off it, said harry, looking around to check that they couldn't be overheard, but the grounds were quite deserted
	he came back to the country just because my scar twinged
	he'll probably come bursting right into the castle if i tell him someone's entered me in the triwizard tournament he'd want you to tell him, said hermione sternly
	he's going to find out anyway
	howharry, this isn't going to be kept quiet, said hermione, very seriously
	this tournament's famous, and you're famous
	i'll be really surprised if there isn't anything in the daily prophet about you competing
	you're already in half the books about youknowwho, you know
	and sirius would rather hear it from you, i know he would
	okay, okay, i'll write to him, said harry, throwing his last piece of toast into the lake
	they both stood and watched it floating there for a moment, before a large tentacle rose out of the water and scooped it beneath the surface
	then they returned to the castle
	whose owl am i going to use harry said as they climbed the stairs
	he told me not to use hedwig again
	ask ron if you can borrow i'm not asking ron for anything, harry said flatly
	well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use them, said hermione
	they went up to the owlery
	hermione gave harry a piece of parchment, a quill, and a bottle of ink, then strolled around the long lines of perches, looking at all the different owls, while harry sat down against a wall and wrote his letter
	dear sirius,you told me to keep you posted on what's happening at hogwarts, so here goes  i don't know if you've heard, but the triwizard tournament's happening this year and on saturday night i got picked as a fourth champion
	i don't who put my name in the goblet of fire, because i didn't
	the other hogwarts champion is cedric diggory,  from hufflepuffhe paused at this point, thinking
	he had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last night, but he couldn't think how to translate this into words, so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote,hope you're okay, and buckbeak    harry finished, he told hermione, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes
	at this, hedwig fluttered down onto his shoulder and held out her leg
	i can't use you, harry told her, looking around for the school owls
	i've got to use one of these
	hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her talons cut into his shoulder
	she kept her back to harry all the time he was tying his letter to the leg of a large barn owl
	when the barn owl had flown off, harry reached out to stroke hedwig, but she clicked her beak furiously and soared up into the rafters out of reach
	first ron, then you, harry said angrily
	this isn't my fault
	if harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of him being champion, the following day showed him how mistaken he was
	he could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at lessons  and it was clear that the rest of the school, just like the gryffindors, thought harry had entered himself for the tournament
	unlike the gryffindors, however, they did not seem impressed
	the hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms with the gryffindors, had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them
	one herbology lesson was enough to demonstrate this
	it was plain that the hufflepuffs felt that harry had stolen their champion's glory a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by the fact that hufflepuff house very rarely got any glory, and that cedric was one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten gryffindor once at quidditch
	ernie macmillan and justin finchfletchley, with whom harry normally got on very well, did not talk to him even though they were repotting bouncing bulbs at the same tray  though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the bouncing bulbs wriggled free from harry's grip and smacked him hard in the face
	ron wasn't talking to harry either
	hermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though both answered her normally, they avoided making eye contact with each other
	harry thought even professor sprout seemed distant with him  but then, she was head of hufflepuff house
	he would have been looking forward to seeing hagrid under normal circumstances, but care of magical creatures meant seeing the slytherins too  the first time he would come facetoface with them since becoming champion
	predictably, malfoy arrived at hagrid's cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in place
	ah, look, boys, it's the champion, he said to crabbe and goyle the moment he got within earshot of harry
	got your autograph books  better get a signature now, because i doubt he's going to be around much longer
	half the triwizard champions have died
	how long d'you reckon you're going to last, potter  ten minutes into the first task's my bet
	crabbe and goyle guffawed sycophantically, but malfoy had to stop there, because hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower of crates, each containing a very large blastended skrewt
	to the class's horror, hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one another was an excess of pentup energy, and that the solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk
	the only good thing about this plan was that it distracted malfoy completely
	take this thing for a walk  he repeated in disgust, staring into one of the boxes
	and where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash  around the sting, the blasting end, or the suckerroun' the middle, said hagrid, demonstrating
	er  yeh might want ter put on yer dragonhide gloves, jus' as an extra precaution, like
	harry  you come here an' help me with this big one
	hagrid's real intention, however, was totalk to harry away from the rest of the class
	he waited until everyone else had set off with their skrewts, then turned to harry and said, very seriously, so  yer competin', harry
	one of the champions, harry corrected him
	hagrid's beetleblack eyes looked very anxious under his wild eyebrows
	no idea who put yeh in fer it, harryyou believe i didn't do it, then said harry, concealing with difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt at hagrid's words
	course i do, hagrid grunted
	yeh say it wasn' you, an' i believe yeh  an' dumbledore believes yer, an' all
	wish i knew who did do it, said harry bitterly
	the pair of them looked out over the lawn the class was widely scattered now, and all in great difficulty
	the skrewts were now over three feet long, and extremely powerful
	no longer shellless and colorless, they had developed a kind of thick, grayish, shiny armor
	they looked like a cross between giant scorpions and elongated crabs  but still without recognizable heads or eyes
	they had become immensely strong and very hard to control
	look like they're havin' fun, don' they  hagrid said happily
	harry assumed he was talking about the skrewts, because his classmates certainly weren't every now and then, with an alarming bang, one of the skrewts' ends would explode, causing it to shoot forward several yards, and more than one person was being dragged along on their stomach, trying desperately to get back on their feet
	ah, i don' know, harry, hagrid sighed suddenly, looking back down at him with a worried expression on his face
	everythin' seems ter happen ter you, doesn' itharry didn't answer
	yes, everything did seem to happen to him
	that was more or less what hermione had said as they had walked around the lake, and that was the reason, according to her, that ron was no longer talking to him
	the next few days were some of harry's worst at hogwarts
	the closest he had ever come to feeling like this had been during those months, in his second year, when a large part of the school had suspected him of attacking his fellow students
	but ron had been on his side then
	he thought he could have coped with the rest of the school's behavior if he could just have had ron back as a friend, but he wasn't going to try and persuade ron to talk to him if ron didn't want to
	nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from all sides
	he could understand the hufflepuffs' attitude, even if he didn't like it they had their own champion to support
	he expected nothing less than vicious insults from the slytherins  he was highly unpopular there and always had been, because he had helped gryffindor beat them so often, both at quidditch and in the interhouse championship
	but he had hoped the ravenclaws might have found it in their hearts to support him as much as cedric
	he was wrong, however
	most ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his name
	then there was the fact that cedric looked the part of a champion so much more than he did
	exceptionally handsome, with his straight nose, dark hair, and gray eyes, it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these days, cedric or viktor krum
	harry actually saw the same sixthyear girls who had been so keen to get krum's autograph begging cedric to sign their school bags one lunchtime
	meanwhile there was no reply from sirius, hedwig was refusing to come anywhere near him, professor trelawney was predicting his death with even more certainty than usual, and he did so badly at summoning charms in professor flitwick's class that he was given extra homework  the only person to get any, apart from neville
	it's really not that difficult, harry, hermione tried to reassure him as they left flitwick's class  she had been making objects zoom across the room to her all lesson, as though she were some sort of weird magnet for board dusters, wastepaper baskets, and lunascopes
	you just weren't concentrating properly wonder why that was, said harry darkly as cedric diggory walked past, surrounded by a large group of simpering girls, all of whom looked at harry as though he were a particularly large blastended skrewt
	still  never mind, eh  double potions to look forward to this afternoon
	double potions was always a horrible experience, but these days it was nothing short of torture
	being shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with snape and the slytherins, all of whom seemed determined to punish harry as much as possible for daring to become school champion, was about the most unpleasant thing harry could imagine
	he had already struggled through one friday's worth, with hermione sitting next to him intoning ignore them, ignore them, ignore them under her breath, and he couldn't see why today should be any better
	when he and hermione arrived at snape's dungeon after lunch, they found the slytherins waiting outside, each and every one of them wearing a large badge on the front of his or her robes
	for one wild moment harry thought they were s
	badges  then he saw that they all bore the same message, in luminous red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground passagesupport cedric diggorythe real hogwarts championlike them, potter said malfoy loudly as harry approached
	and this isn't all they do  look he pressed his badge into his chest, and the message upon it vanished, to be replaced by another one, which glowed greenpotter stinksthe slytherins howled with laughter
	each of them pressed their badges too, until the message potter stinks was shining brightly all around harry
	he felt the heat rise in his face and neck
	oh very funny, hermione said sarcastically to pansy parkinson and her gang of slytherin girls, who were laughing harder than anyone, really witty
	ron was standing against the wall with dean and seamus
	he wasn't laughing, but he wasn't sticking up for harry either
	want one, granger  said malfoy, holding out a badge to hermione
	but don't touch my hand, now
	i've just washed it, you see don't want a mudblood sliming it up
	some of the anger harry had been feeling for days and days seemed to burst through a dam in his chest
	he had reached for his wand before he'd thought what he was doing
	people all around them scrambled out of the way, backing down the corridor
	harry hermione said warningly
	go on, then, potter, malfoy said quietly, drawing out his own wand
	moody's not here to look after you now  do it, if you've got the guts for a split second, they looked into each other's eyes, then, at exactly the same time, both acted
	funnunculus  harry yelled
	densaugeo  screamed malfoy
	jets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in midair, and ricocheted off at angles  harry's hit goyle in the face, and malfoy's hit hermione
	goyle bellowed and put his hands to his nose, where great ugly boils were springing up  hermione, whimpering in panic, was clutching her mouth
	hermioneron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her harry turned and saw ron dragging hermione's hand away from her face
	it wasn't a pretty sight
	hermione's front teeth  already larger than average  were now growing at an alarming rate she was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated, past her bottom lip, toward her chin  panicstricken, she felt them and let out a terrified cry
	and what is all this noise about said a soft, deadly voice
	the slytherins clamored to give their explanations snape pointed a long yellow finger at malfoy and said, explain
	potter attacked me, sir we attacked each other at the same time  harry shouted
	and he hit goyle  look snape examined goyle, whose face now resembled something that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi
	hospital wing, goyle, snape said calmly
	malfoy got hermione ron said
	lookhe forced hermione to show snape her teeth  she was doing her best to hide them with her hands, though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her collar
	pansy parkinson and the other slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles, pointing at hermione from behind snape's back
	snape looked coldly at hermione, then said, i see no difference
	hermione let out a whimper her eyes filled with tears, she turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight
	it was lucky, perhaps, that both harry and ron started shouting at snape at the same time lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor, for in the confused din, it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were calling him
	he got the gist, however
	let's see, he said, in his silkiest voice
	fifty points from gryffindor and a detention each for potter and weasley
	now get inside, or it'll be a week's worth of detentions
	harry's ears were ringing
	the injustice of it made him want to curse snape into a thousand slimy pieces
	he passed snape, walked with ron to the back of the dungeon, and slammed his bag down onto the table
	ron was shaking with anger too  for a moment, it felt as though everything was back to normal between them, but then ron turned and sat down with dean and seamus instead, leaving harry alone at his table
	on the other side of the dungeon, malfoy turned his back on snape and pressed his badge, smirking
	potter stinks flashed once more across the room
	harry sat there staring at snape as the lesson began, picturing horrific things happening to him
	if only he knew how to do the cruciatus curse
	he'd have snape flat on his back like that spider, jerking and twitching
	antidotes said snape, looking around at them all, his cold black eyes glittering unpleasantly
	you should all have prepared your recipes now
	i want you to brew them carefully, and then, we will be selecting someone on whom to test one
	snape's eyes met harry's, and harry knew what was coming
	snape was going to poison him
	harry imagined picking up his cauldron, and sprinting to the front of the class, and bringing it down on snape's greasy head  and then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on harry's thoughts
	it was colin creevey he edged into the room, beaming at harry, and walked up to snape's desk at the front of the room
	yes said snape curtly
	please, sir, i'm supposed to take harry potter upstairs
	snape stared down his hooked nose at colin, whose smile faded from his eager face
	potter has another hour of potions to complete, said snape coldly
	he will come upstairs when this class is finished
	bagman wants him, he said nervously
	all the champions have got to go, i think they want to take photographs
	harry would have given anything he owned to have stopped colin saying those last few words
	he chanced half a glance at ron, but ron was staring determinedly at the ceiling
	very well, very well, snape snapped
	potter, leave your things here, i want you back down here later to test your antidote
	please, sir  he's got to take his things with him, squeaked cohn
	potter  take your bag and get out of my sight harry swung his bag over his shoulder, got up, and headed for the door
	as he walked through the slytherin desks, potter stinks flashed at him from every direction
	it's amazing, isn't it, harry said colin, starting to speak the moment harry had closed the dungeon door behind him
	isn't it, though you being championyeah, really amazing, said harry heavily as they set off toward the steps into the entrance hall
	what do they want photos for, colinthe daily prophet, i thinkgreat, said harry dully
	exactly what i need
	good luck said colin when they had reached the right room
	harry knocked on the door and entered
	he was in a fairly small classroom most of the desks had been pushed away to the back of the room, leaving a large space in the middle three of them, however, had been placed endtoend in front of the blackboard and covered with a long length of velvet
	five chairs had been set behind the velvetcovered desks, and ludo bagman was sitting in one of them, talking to a witch harry had never seen before, who was wearing magenta robes
	viktor krum was standing moodily in a corner as usual and not talking to anybody
	cedric and fheur were in conversation
	fheur looked a good deal happier than harry had seen her so far she kept throwing back her head so that her long silvery hair caught the light
	a paunchy man, holding a large black camera that was smoking slightly, was watching fleur out of the corner of his eye
	bagman suddenly spotted harry, got up quickly, and bounded forward
	ah, here he is  champion number four  in you come, harry, in you come
	nothing to worry about, it's just the wand weighing ceremony, the rest of the judges will be here in a moment wand weighing harry repeated nervously
	we have to check that your wands are fully functional, no problems, you know, as they're your most important tools in the tasks ahead, said bagman
	the expert's upstairs now with dumbledore
	and then there's going to be a little photo shoot
	this is rita skeeter, he added, gesturing toward the witch in magenta robes
	she's doing a small piece on the tournament for the daily prophet
	maybe not that small, ludo, said rita skeeter, her eyes on harry
	her hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls that contrasted oddly with her heavyjawed face
	she wore jeweled spectacles
	the thick fingers clutching her crocodileskin handbag ended in twoinch nails, painted crimson
	i wonder if i could have a little word with harry before we start  she said to bagman, but still gazing fixedly at harry
	the youngest champion, you know
	to add a bit of colorcertainly cried bagman
	that is  if harry has no objectioner  said harry
	lovely, said rita skeeter, and in a second, her scarlettaloned fingers had harry's upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip, and she was steering him out of the room again and opening a nearby door
	we don't want to be in there with all that noise, she said
	ah, yes, this is nice and cozy
	it was a broom cupboard
	harry stared at her
	come along, dear  that's right  lovely, said rita skeeter again, perching herself precariously upon an upturned bucket, pushing harry down onto a cardboard box, and closing the door, throwing them into darkness
	she unsnapped her crocodileskin handbag and pulled out a handful of candles, which she lit with a wave of her wand and magicked into midair, so that they could see what they were doing
	you won't mind, harry, if i use a quickquotes quill  it leaves me free to talk to you normally
	rita skeeter's smile widened
	harry counted three gold teeth
	she reached again into her crocodile bag and drew out a long acidgreen quill and a roll of parchment, which she stretched out between them on a crate of mrs
	skower's allpurpose magical mess remover
	she put the tip of the green quill into her mouth, sucked it for a moment with apparent relish, then placed it upright on the parchment, where it stood balanced on its point, quivering slightly
	my name is rita skeeter, daily prophet reporter
	harry hooked down quickly at the quill
	the moment rita skeeter had spoken, the green quill had started to scribble, skidding across the parchmentattractive blonde rita skeeter, fortythree, who's savage quill has punctured many inflated reputations  lovely, said rita skeeter, yet again, and she ripped the top piece of parchment off, crumpled it up, and stuffed it into her handbag
	now she leaned toward harry and said, so, harry
	what made you decide to enter the triwizard tournamenter  said harry again, but he was distracted by the quill
	even though he wasn't speaking, it was dashing across the parchment, and in its wake he could make out a fresh sentencean ugly scar, souvenier of a tragic past, disfigures the otherwise charming face of harry potter, whose eyes  ignore the quill, harry, said rita skeeter firmly
	reluctantly harry looked up at her instead
	now  why did you decide to enter the tournament, harryi didn't, said harry
	i don't know how my name got into the goblet of fire
	i didn't put it in there
	rita skeeter raised one heavily penciled eyebrow
	come now, harry, there's no need to be scared of getting into trouble
	we all know you shouldn't really have entered at all
	but don't worry about that
	our readers hove a rebel
	but i didn't enter, harry repeated
	i don't know who how do you feel about the tasks ahead  said rita skeeter
	excited  nervousi haven't really thought
	yeah, nervous, i suppose, said harry
	his insides squirmed uncomfortably as he spoke
	champions have died in the past, haven't they  said rita skeeter briskly
	have you thought about that at allwell
	they say it's going to be a lot safer this year, said harry
	the quill whizzed across the parchment between them, back and forward as though it were skating
	of course, you've looked death in the face before, haven't you  said rita skeeter, watching him closely
	how would you say that's affected youer, said harry, yet again
	do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove yourself to live up to your name  do you think that perhaps you were tempted to enter the triwizard tournament because  i didn't enter, said harry, starting to feel irritated
	can you remember your parents at all  said rita skeeter, talking over him
	how do you think they'd feel if they knew you were competing in the triwizard tournament  proud  worried  angryharry was feeling really annoyed now
	how on earth was he to know how his parents would feel if they were alive  he could feel rita skeeter watching him very intently
	frowning, he avoided her gaze and hooked down at words the quill had just writtentears fill those startlingly green eyes as our conversation turns to the parents he can barely remember
	i have not got tears in my eyes  said harry loudly
	before rita skeeter could say a word, the door of the broom cupboard was pulled open
	harry looked around, blinking in the bright light
	albus dumbledore stood there, looking down at both of them, squashed into the cupboard
	dumbledore  cried rita skeeter, with every appearance of delight  but harry noticed that her quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from the box of magical mess remover, and rita's clawed fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her crocodileskin bag
	how are you she said, standing up and holding out one of her large, mannish hands to dumbledore
	i hope you saw my piece over the summer about the international confederation of wizards' conferenceenchantingly nasty, said dumbledore, his eyes twinkling
	i particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat
	rita skeeter didn't look remotely abashed
	i was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little oldfashioned, dumbhedore, and that many wizards in the street i will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness, rita, said dumbledore, with a courteous bow and a smile, but i'm afraid we will have to discuss the matter later
	the weighing of the wands is about to start, and it cannot take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard
	very glad to get away from rita skeeter, harry hurried back into the room
	the other champions were now sitting in chairs near the door, and he sat down quickly next to cedric, hooking up at the velvetcovered table, where four of the five judges were now sitting  professor karkaroff, madame maxime, mr
	crouch, and ludo bagman
	rita skeeter settled herself down in a corner harry saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again, spread it on her knee, suck the end of the quickquotes quill, and place it once more on the parchment
	ollivander  said dumbledore, taking his place at the judges' table and talking to the champions
	he will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament
	harry hooked around, and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with large, pale eyes standing quietly by the window
	ollivander before  he was the wandmaker from whom harry had bought his own wand over three years ago in diagon alley
	mademoiselle delacour, could we have you first, please said mr
	ollivander, stepping into the empty space in the middle of the room
	fleur delacour swept over to mr
	olhivander and handed him her wand
	he twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it emitted a number of pink and gold sparks
	then he held it chose to his eyes and examined it carefully
	yes, he said quietly, nine and a half inches
	an 'air from ze 'ead of a veela, said fleur
	one of my grandmuzzer's
	so fleur was part veela, thought harry, making a mental note to tell ron
	then he remembered that ron wasn't speaking to him
	ollivander, yes, i've never used veela hair myself, of course
	i find it makes for rather temperamental wands
	however, to each his own, and if this suits you
	ollivander ran his fingers along the wand, apparently checking for scratches or bumps then he muttered, orchideous  and a bunch of flowers burst from the wand tip
	very well, very well, it's in fine working order, said mr
	ollivander, scooping up the flowers and handing them to fleur with her wand
	fleur glided back to her seat, smiling at cedric as he passed her
	ah, now, this is one of mine, isn't it said mr
	ollivander, with much more enthusiasm, as cedric handed over his wand
	yes, i remember it well
	containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn
	must have been seventeen hands nearly gored me with his horn after i plucked his tail
	twelve and a quarter inches
	it's in fine condition
	you treat it regularlypolished it last night, said cedric, grinning
	harry hooked down at his own wand
	he could see finger marks all over it
	he gathered a fistful of robe from his knee and tried to rub it clean surreptitiously
	several gold sparks shot out of the end of it
	fleur delacour gave him a very patronizing look, and he desisted
	ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the room from the tip of cedric's wand, pronounced himself satisfied, and then said, mr
	viktor krum got up and slouched, roundshouldered and duckfooted, toward mr
	he thrust out his wand and stood scowling, with his hands in the pockets of his robes
	olhivander, this is a gregorovitch creation, unless i'm much mistaken  a fine wandmaker, though the styling is never quite what i
	he lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning it over and over before his eyes
	hornbeam and dragon heartstring  he shot at krum, who nodded
	rather thicker than one usually sees
	ten and a quarter inches
	avisthe hornbeam wand let off a blast hike a gun, and a number of small, twittering birds flew out of the end and through the open window into the watery sunlight
	ollivander, handing krum back his wand
	harry got to his feet and walked past krum to mr
	he handed over his wand
	ohlivander, his pale eyes suddenly gleaming
	harry could remember too
	he could remember it as though it had happened yesterday
	four summers ago, on his eleventh birthday, he had entered mr
	ollivander's shop with hagrid to buy a wand
	ollivander had taken his measurements and then started handing him wands to try
	harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop, until at last he had found the one that suited him  this one, which was made of holly, eleven inches long, and contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix
	ollivander had been very surprised that harry had been so compatible with this wand
	curious, he had said, curious, and not until harry asked what was curious had mr
	olhivander explained that the phoenix feather in harry's wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of lord voldemort's
	harry had never shared this piece of information with anybody
	he was very fond of his wand, and as far as he was concerned its relation to voldemort's wand was something it couldn't help  rather as he couldn't help being related to aunt petunia
	however, he really hoped that mr
	ollivander wasn't about to tell the room about it
	he had a funny feeling rita skeeter's quickquotes quill might just explode with excitement if he did
	ollivander spent much longer examining harry's wand than anyone else's
	eventually, however, he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and handed it back to harry, announcing that it was still in perfect condition
	thank you all, said dumbledore, standing up at the judges' table
	you may go back to your lessons now  or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner, as they are about to end feeling that at last something had gone right today, harry got up to leave, but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat
	photos, dumbledore, photos  cried bagman excitedly
	all the judges and champions, what do you think, ritaer  yes, let's do those first, said rita skeeter, whose eyes were upon harry again
	and then perhaps some individual shots
	the photographs took a long time
	madame maxime cast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood, and the photographer couldn't stand far enough back to get her into the frame eventually she had to sit while everyone else stood around her
	karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra curl krum, whom harry would have thought would have been used to this sort of thing, skulked, halfhidden, at the back of the group
	the photographer seemed keenest to get fleur at the front, but rita skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging harry into greater prominence
	then she insisted on separate shots of all the champions
	at last, they were free to go
	harry went down to dinner
	hermione wasn't there  he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed
	he ate alone at the end of the table, then returned to gryffindor tower, thinking of all the extra work on summoning charms that he had to do
	up in the dormitory, he came across ron
	you've had an owl, said ron brusquely the moment he walked in
	he was pointing at harry's pillow
	the school barn owl was waiting for him there
	oh  right, said harry
	and we've got to do our detentions tomorrow night, snape's dungeon, said ron
	he then walked straight out of the room, not looking at harry
	for a moment, harry considered going after him  he wasn't sure whether he wanted to talk to him or hit him, both seemed quite appealing  but the lure of sirius's answer was too strong
	harry strode over to the barn owl, took the letter off its leg, and unrolled it
	harry  i can't say everything i would like to in a letter, it's too riskyin case the owl is intercepted  we need to talk facetoface
	can you ensure that you are alone by the fire in gryffindor tower at one o'clock in the morning on the 22nd ofnovemberi know better than anyone that you can look after yourself and while you're around dumbledore and moody i don't think anyone will be able to hurt you
	however, someone seems to be having a good try
	entering you in that tournament would have been very risky, especially right under dumbkdore's nose
	be on the watch, harry
	i still want to hear about anything unusual
	let me know about the 22nd ofnovember as quickly as you can
	siriuschapter nineteen  the hungarian horntailthe prospect of talking facetoface with sirius was all that sustained harry over the next fortnight, the only bright spot on a horizon that had never looked darker
	the shock of finding himself school champion had worn off slightly now, and the fear of what was facing him had started to sink in
	the first task was drawing steadily nearer he felt as though it were crouching ahead of him hike some horrific monster, barring his path
	he had never suffered nerves like these they were way beyond anything he had experienced before a quidditch match, not even his last one against slytherin, which had decided who would win the quidditch cup
	harry was finding it hard to think about the future at all he felt as though his whole life had been heading up to, and would finish with, the first task
	admittedly, he didn't see how sirius was going to make him feel any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in front of hundreds of people, but the mere sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment
	harry wrote back to sirius saying that he would be beside the common room fire at the time sirius had suggested and he and hermione spent a long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the common room on the night in question
	if the worst came to the worst, they were going to drop a bag of dungbombs, but they hoped they wouldn't have to resort to that  filch would skin them alive
	in the meantime, life became even worse for harry within the confines of the castle, for rita skeeter had published her piece about the triwizard tournament, and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story of harry
	much of the front page had been given over to a picture of harry the article continuing on pages two, six, and seven had been all about harry, the names of the beauxbatons and durmstrang champions misspelled had been squashed into the last line of the article, and cedric hadn't been mentioned at all
	the article had appeared ten days ago, and harry still got a sick, burning feeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought about it
	rita skeeter had reported him saying an awful lot of things that he couldn't remember ever saying in his life, let alone in that broom cupboard
	i suppose i get my strength from my parents
	i know they'd be very proud of me if they could see me now
	yes, sometimes at night i still cry about them, i'm not ashamed to admit it
	i know nothing will hurt me during the tournament, because they're watching over me
	but rita skeeter had gone even further than transforming his er's into long, sickly sentences  she had interviewed other people about him too
	harry has at last found love at hogwarts
	his close friend, colin creevey, says that harry is rarely seen out of the company of one hermione granger, a stunningly pretty muggleborn girl who, like harry, is one of the top students in the school
	from the moment the article had appeared, harry had had to endure people slytherins, mainly  quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering comments
	want a hanky, potter, in case you start crying in transfigurationsince when have you been one of the top students in the school, potter  or is this a school you and longbottom have set up togetherhey  harryyeah, that's right  harry found himself shouting as he wheeled around in the corridor, having had just about enough
	i've just been crying my eyes out over my dead mum, and i'm just off to do a bit more
	no  it was just  you dropped your quill
	harry felt the color rising in his face
	oh  right  sorry, he muttered, taking the quill back
	good luck on tuesday, she said
	i really hope you do well
	which left harry feeling extremely stupid
	hermione had come in for her fair share of unpleasantness too, but she hadn't yet started yelling at innocent bystanders in fact, harry was full of admiration for the way she was handling the situation
	stunningly pretty her  pansy parkinson had shrieked the first time she had come facetoface with hermione after rita's article had appeared
	what was she judging against  a chipmunkignore it, hermione said in a dignified voice, holding her head in the air and stalking past the sniggering slytherin girls as though she couldn't hear them
	just ignore it, harry
	but harry couldn't ignore it
	ron hadn't spoken to him at all since he had told him about snape's detentions
	harry had half hoped they would make things up during the two hours they were forced to pickle rats' brains in snape's dungeon, but that had been the day rita's article had appeared, which seemed to have confirmed ron's belief that harry was really enjoying all the attention
	hermione was furious with the pair of them she went from one to the other, trying to force them to talk to each other, but harry was adamant  he would talk to ron again only if ron admitted that harry hadn't put his name in the goblet of fire and apologized for calling him a liar
	i didn't start this, harry said stubbornly
	you miss him  hermione said impatiently
	and i know he misses you miss him  said harry
	but this was a downright lie
	harry liked hermione very much, but she just wasn't the same as ron
	there was much hess laughter and a lot more hanging around in the library when hermione was your best friend
	harry still hadn't mastered summoning charms, he seemed to have developed something of a block about them, and hermione insisted that learning the theory would help
	they consequently spent a lot of time poring over books during their lunchtimes
	viktor krum was in the library an awful lot too, and harry wondered what he was up to
	was he studying, or was he looking for things to help him through the first task  hermione often complained about krum being there  not that he ever bothered them  but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy on him from behind bookshelves, and hermione found the noise distracting
	he's not even goodlooking  she muttered angrily, glaring at krum's sharp profile
	they only like him because he's famous  they wouldn't look twice at him if he couldn't do that wonkyfaint thing wronski feint, said harry, through gritted teeth
	quite apart from liking to get quidditch terms correct, it caused him another pang to imagine ron's expression if he could have heard hermione talking about wonkyfaints
	it is a strange thing, but when you are dreading something, and would give anything to slow down time, it has a disobliging habit of speeding up
	the days until the first task seemed to slip by as though someone had fixed the clocks to work at double speed
	harry's feeling of barely controlled panic was with him wherever he went, as everpresent as the snide comments about the daily prophet article
	on the saturday before the first task, all students in the third year and above were permitted to visit the village of hogsmeade
	hermione told harry that it would do him good to get away from the castle for a bit, and harry didn't need much persuasion
	what about ron, though  he said
	don't you want to go with himoh
	hermione went slightly pink
	i thought we might meet up with him in the three broomsticks
	no, said harry flatly
	oh harry, this is so stupid i'll come, but i'm not meeting ron, and i'm wearing my invisibility cloak
	hermione snapped, but i hate talking to you in that cloak, i never know if i'm looking at you or not
	so harry put on his invisibility cloak in the dormitory, went back downstairs, and together he and hermione set off for hogsmeade
	harry felt wonderfully free under the cloak he watched other students walking past them as they entered the village, most of them sporting support cedric diggory  badges, but no horrible remarks came his way for a change, and nobody was quoting that stupid article
	people keep looking at me now, said hermione grumpily as they came out of honeydukes sweetshop later, eating large creamfilled chocolates
	they think i'm talking to myself
	don't move your lips so much then
	come on, please just take off your cloak for a bit, no one's going to bother you here
	rita skeeter and her photographer friend had just emerged from the three broomsticks pub
	talking in low voices, they passed right by hermione without hooking at her
	harry backed into the wall of honeydukes to stop rita skeeter from hitting him with her crocodileskin handbag
	when they were gone, harry said, she's staying in the village
	i bet she's coming to watch the first task
	as he said it, his stomach flooded with a wave of molten panic
	he didn't mention this he and hermione hadn't discussed what was coming in the first task much he had the feeling she didn't want to think about it
	she's gone, said hermione, looking right through harry toward the end of the street
	why don't we go and have a butterbeer in the three broomsticks, it's a bit cold, isn't it  you don't have to talk to ron  she added irritably, correctly interpreting his silence
	the three broomsticks was packed, mainly with hogwarts students enjoying their free afternoon, but also with a variety of magical people harry rarely saw anywhere else
	harry supposed that as hogsmeade was the only allwizard village in britain, it was a bit of a haven for creatures like hags, who were not as adept as wizards at disguising themselves
	it was very hard to move through crowds in the invisibility cloak, in case you accidentally trod on someone, which tended to lead to awkward questions
	harry edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner while hermione went to buy drinks
	on his way through the pub, harry spotted ron, who was sitting with fred, george, and lee jordan
	resisting the urge to give ron a good hard poke in the back of the head, he finally reached the table and sat down at it
	hermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a butterbeer under his cloak
	i look like such an idiot, sitting here on my own, she muttered
	lucky i brought something to do
	and she pulled out a notebook in which she had been keeping a record of s
	harry saw his and ron's names at the top of the very short list
	it seemed a long time ago that they had sat making up those predictions together, and hermione had turned up and appointed them secretary and treasurer
	you know, maybe i should try and get some of the villagers involved in s
	, hermione said thoughtfully, looking around the pub
	yeah, right, said harry
	he took a swig of butterbeer under his cloak
	hermione, when are you going to give up on this spew stuffwhen houseelves have decent wages and working conditions  she hissed back
	you know, i'm starting to think it's time for more direct action
	i wonder how you get into the school kitchensno idea, ask fred and george, said harry
	hermione lapsed into thoughtful silence, while harry drank his butterbeer, watching the people in the pub
	all of them looked cheerful and relaxed
	ernie macmillan and hannah abbot were swapping chocolate frog cards at a nearby table both of them sporting support cedric diggory badges on their cloaks
	right over by the door he saw cho and a large group of her ravenclaw friends
	she wasn't wearing a cedric badge though
	this cheered up harry very slightly
	what wouldn't he have given to be one of these peophe, sitting around laughing and talking, with nothing to worry about but homework  he imagined how it would have felt to be here if his name hadn't come out of the goblet of fire
	he wouldn't be wearing the invisibility cloak, for one thing
	ron would be sitting with him
	the three of them would probably be happily imagining what deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing on tuesday
	he'd have been really hooking forward to it, watching them do whatever it was
	cheering on cedric with everyone else, safe in a seat at the back of the stands
	he wondered how the other champions were feeling
	every time he had seen cedric lately, he had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but excited
	harry glimpsed fleur delacour from time to time in the corridors she looked exactly as she always did, haughty and unruffled
	and krum just sat in the library, poring over books
	harry thought of sirius, and the tight, tense knot in his chest seemed to ease slightly
	he would be speaking to him in just over twelve hours, for tonight was the night they were meeting at the common room fire  assuming nothing went wrong, as everything else had done lately
	look, it's hagrid said hermione
	the back of hagrid's enormous shaggy head  he had mercifully abandoned his bunches  emerged over the crowd
	harry wondered why he hadn't spotted him at once, as hagrid was so large, but standing up carefully, he saw that hagrid had been leaning low, talking to professor moody
	hagrid had his usual enormous tankard in front of him, but moody was drinking from his hip flask
	madam rosmerta, the pretty landlady, didn't seem to think much of this she was looking askance at moody as she collected glasses from tables around them
	perhaps she thought it was an insult to her mulled mead, but harry knew better
	moody had told them all during their last defense against the dark arts lesson that he preferred to prepare his own food and drink at all times, as it was so easy for dark wizards to poison an unattended cup
	as harry watched, he saw hagrid and moody get up to leave
	he waved, then remembered that hagrid couldn't see him
	moody, however, paused, his magical eye on the corner where harry was standing
	he tapped hagrid in the small of the back being unable to reach his shoulder, muttered something to him, and then the pair of them made their way back across the pub toward harry and hermione's table
	all right, hermione said hagrid loudly
	hello, said hermione, smiling back
	moody limped around the table and bent down harry thought he was reading the s
	notebook, until he muttered, nice cloak, potter
	harry stared at him in amazement
	the large chunk missing from moody's nose was particularly obvious at a few inches' distance
	can your eye  i mean, can you  yeah, it can see through invisibility cloaks, moody said quietly
	and it's come in useful at times, i can tell you
	hagrid was beaming down at harry too
	harry knew hagrid couldn't see him, but moody had obviously told hagrid he was there
	hagrid now bent down on the pretext of reading the s
	notebook as well, and said in a whisper so low that only harry could hear it, harry, meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin
	straightening up, hagrid said loudly, nice ter see yeh, hermione, winked, and departed
	why does hagrid want me to meet him at midnight harry said, very surprised
	does he said hermione, looking startled
	i wonder what he's up to  i don't know whether you should go, harry
	she looked nervously around and hissed, it might make you late for sirius
	it was true that going down to hagrid's at midnight would mean cutting his meeting with sirius very fine indeed hermione suggested sending hedwig down to hagrid's to tell him he couldn't go  always assuming she would consent to take the note, of course  harry, however, thought it better just to be quick at whatever hagrid wanted him for
	he was very curious to know what this might be hagrid had never asked harry to visit him so late at night
	at half past eleven that evening, harry, who had pretended to go up to bed early, pulled the invisibility cloak back over himself and crept back downstairs through the common room
	quite a few people were still in there
	the creevey brothers had managed to get hold of a stack of support cedric diggory  badges and were trying to bewitch them to make them say support harry potter instead
	so far, however, all they had managed to do was get the badges stuck on potter stinks
	harry crept past them to the portrait hole and waited for a minute or so, keeping an eye on his watch
	then hermione opened the fat lady for him from outside as they had planned
	he slipped past her with a whispered thanks  and set off through the castle
	the grounds were very dark
	harry walked down the lawn toward the lights shining in hagrid's cabin
	the inside of the enormous beauxbatons carriage was also lit up harry could hear madame maxime talking inside it as he knocked on hagrid's front door
	you there, harry  hagrid whispered, opening the door and looking around
	yeah, said harry, slipping inside the cabin and pulling the cloak down off his head
	what's upgot summat ter show yeh, said hagrid
	there was an air of enormous excitement about hagrid
	he was wearing a flower that resembled an oversized artichoke in his buttonhole
	it looked as though he had abandoned the use of axle grease, but he had certainly attempted to comb his hair  harry could see the comb's broken teeth tangled in it
	what're you showing me harry said warily, wondering if the skrewts had laid eggs, or hagrid had managed to buy another giant threeheaded dog off a stranger in a pub
	come with me, keep quiet, an' keep yerself covered with that cloak, said hagrid
	we won' take fang, he won' like it
	listen, hagrid, i can't stay long
	i've got to be back up at the castle by one o'clock but hagrid wasn't listening he was opening the cabin door and striding off into the night
	harry hurried to follow and found, to his great surprise, that hagrid was leading him to the beauxbatons carriage
	hagrid, what  shhh said hagrid, and he knocked three times on the door bearing the crossed golden wands
	madame maxime opened it
	she was wearing a silk shawl wrapped around her massive shoulders
	she smiled when she saw hagrid
	it is timebongsewer, said hagrid, beaming at her, and holding out a hand to help her down the golden steps
	madame maxime closed the door behind her, hagrid offered her his arm, and they set off around the edge of the paddock containing madame maxime's giant winged horses, with harry, totally bewildered, running to keep up with them
	had hagrid wanted to show him madame maxime  he could see her any old time he wanted
	she wasn't exactly hard to miss
	but it seemed that madame maxime was in for the same treat as harry, because after a while she said playfully,  wair is it you are taking me, 'agridyeh'll enjoy this, said hagrid gruffly, worth seein', trust me
	on'y  don' go tellin' anyone i showed yeh, right  yeh're not s'posed ter know
	of course not, said madame maxime, fluttering her long black eyelashes
	and still they walked, harry getting more and more irritated as he jogged along in their wake, checking his watch every now and then
	hagrid had some harebrained scheme in hand, which might make him miss sirius
	if they didn't get there soon, he was going to turn around, go straight back to the castle, and leave hagrid to enjoy his moonlit stroll with madame maxime
	but then  when they had walked so far around the perimeter of the forest that the castle and the lake were out of sight  harry heard something
	men were shouting up ahead
	then came a deafening, earsplitting roar
	hagrid led madame maxime around a clump of trees and came to a halt
	harry hurried up alongside them  for a split second, he thought he was seeing bonfires, and men darting around them  and then his mouth fell open
	four fully grown, enormous, viciouslooking dragons were rearing onto their hind legs inside an enclosure fenced with thick planks of wood, roaring and snorting  torrents of fire were shooting into the dark sky from their open, fanged mouths, fifty feet above the ground on their outstretched necks
	there was a silveryblue one with long, pointed horns, snapping and snarling at the wizards on the ground a smoothscaled green one, which was writhing and stamping with all its might a red one with an odd fringe of fine gold spikes around its face, which was shooting mushroomshaped fire clouds into the air and a gigantic black one, more lizardhike than the others, which was nearest to them
	at least thirty wizards, seven or eight to each dragon, were attempting to control them, pulling on the chains connected to heavy leather straps around their necks and legs
	mesmerized, harry looked up, high above him, and saw the eyes of the black dragon, with vertical pupils like a cat's, bulging with either fear or rage, he couldn't tell which
	it was making a horrible noise, a yowling, screeching scream
	keep back there, hagrid  yelled a wizard near the fence, straining on the chain he was holding
	they can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet, you know  i've seen this horntail do fortyis'n' it beautiful  said hagrid softly
	it's no good yelled another wizard
	stunning spells, on the count of threeharry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his wand
	stupefy  they shouted in unison, and the stunning spells shot into the darkness like fiery rockets, bursting in showers of stars on the dragons' scaly hides harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on its back legs its jaws stretched wide in a silent howl its nostrils were suddenly devoid of flame, though still smoking  then, very slowly, it fell
	several tons of sinewy, scalyblack dragon hit the ground with a thud that harry could have sworn made the trees behind him quake
	the dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked forward to their fallen charges, each of which was the size of a small hill
	they hurried to tighten the chains and fasten them securely to iron pegs, which they forced deep into the ground with their wands
	wan' a closer look  hagrid asked madame maxime excitedly
	the pair of them moved right up to the fence, and harry followed
	the wizard who had warned hagrid not to come any closer turned, and harry realized who it was  charlie weasley
	all right, hagrid  he panted, coming over to talk
	they should be okay now  we put them out with a sleeping draft on the way here, thought it might be better for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet  but, like you saw, they weren't happy, not happy at all what breeds you got here, charlie  said hagrid, gazing at the closest dragon, the black one, with something chose to reverence
	its eyes were still just open
	harry could see a strip of gleaming yellow beneath its wrinkled black eyelid
	this is a hungarian horntail, said charlie
	there's a common welsh green over there, the smaller one  a swedish shortsnout, that bluegray  and a chinese fireball, that's the red
	charlie looked around madame maxime was strolling away around the edge of the enclosure, gazing at the stunned dragons
	i didn't know you were bringing her, hagrid, charlie said, frowning
	the champions aren't supposed to know what's coming  she's bound to tell her student, isn't shejus' thought she'd like ter see 'em, shrugged hagrid, still gazing, enraptured, at the dragons
	really romantic date, hagrid, said charlie, shaking his head
	said hagrid, so it's one fer each o' the champions, is it  what've they gotta do  fight 'emjust get past them, i think, said charlie
	we'll be on hand if it gets nasty, extinguishing spells at the ready
	they wanted nesting mothers, i don't know why
	but i tell you this, i don't envy the one who gets the horntail
	its back end's as dangerous as its front, look
	charlie pointed toward the horntail's tail, and harry saw long, bronzecolored spikes protruding along it every few inches
	five of charlie's fellow keepers staggered up to the horntail at that moment, carrying a clutch of huge granitegray eggs between them in a blanket
	they placed them carefully at the horntail's side
	hagrid let out a moan of longing
	i've got them counted, hagrid, said charlie sternly
	then he said, how's harryfine, said hagrid
	he was still gazing at the eggs
	just hope he's still fine after he's faced this lot, said charlie grimly, looking out over the dragons' enclosure
	i didn't dare tell mum what he's got to do for the first task she's already having kittens about him
	charlie imitated his mother's anxious voice
	how could they let him enter that tournament, he's much too young  i thought they were all safe, i thought there was going to be an age limit'  she was in floods after that daily prophet article about him
	'he still cries about his parents  oh bless him, i never knewharry had had enough
	trusting to the fact that hagrid wouldn't miss him, with the attractions of four dragons and madame maxime to occupy him, he turned silently and began to walk away, back to the castle
	he didn't know whether he was glad he'd seen what was coming or not
	perhaps this way was better
	the first shock was over now
	maybe if he'd seen the dragons for the first time on tuesday, he would have passed out cold in front of the whole school
	but maybe he would anyway
	he was going to be armed with his wand  which, just now, felt like nothing more than a narrow strip of wood  against a fiftyfoothigh, scaly, spikeridden, firebreathing dragon
	and he had to get past it
	with everyone watching
	howharry sped up, skirting the edge of the forest he had just under fifteen minutes to get back to the fireside and talk to sirius, and he couldn't remember, ever, wanting to talk to someone more than he did right now  when, without warning, he ran into something very solid
	harry fell backward, his glasses askew, clutching the cloak around him
	a voice nearby said, ouch who's thereharry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and hay very still, staring up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit
	he recognized the goatee
	who's there  said karkaroff again, very suspiciously, looking around in the darkness
	harry remained still and silent
	after a minute or so, karkaroff seemed to decide that he had hit some sort of animal he was looking around at waist height, as though expecting to see a dog
	then he crept back under the cover of the trees and started to edge forward toward the place where the dragons were
	very slowly and very carefully, harry got to his feet and set off again as fast as he could without making too much noise, hurrying through the darkness back toward hogwarts
	he had no doubt whatsoever what karkaroff was up to
	he had sneaked off his ship to try and find out what the first task was going to be
	he might even have spotted hagrid and madame maxime heading off around the forest together  they were hardly difficult to spot at a distance
	and now all karkaroff had to do was follow the sound of voices, and he, like madame maxime, would know what was in store for the champions
	by the looks of it, the only champion who would be facing the unknown on tuesday was cedric
	harry reached the castle, slipped in through the front doors, and began to climb the marble stairs he was very out of breath, but he didn't dare slow down
	he had less than five minutes to get up to the fire
	balderdash he gasped at the fat lady, who was snoozing in her frame in front of the portrait hole
	if you say so, she muttered sleepily, without opening her eyes, and the picture swung forward to admit him
	harry climbed inside
	the common room was deserted, and, judging by the fact that it smelled quite normal, hermione had not needed to set off any dungbombs to ensure that he and sirius got privacy
	harry pulled off the invisibility cloak and threw himself into an armchair in front of the fire
	the room was in semidarkness the flames were the only source of light
	nearby, on a table, the support cedric diggory badges the creeveys had been trying to improve were glinting in the firelight
	they now read potter really stinks
	harry looked back into the flames, and jumped
	sirius's head was sitting in the fire
	if harry hadn't seen mr
	diggory do exactly this back in the weasleys' kitchen, it would have scared him out of his wits
	instead, his face breaking into the first smile he had worn for days, he scrambled out of his chair, crouched down by the hearth, and said, sirius  how're you doingsirius looked different from harry's memory of him
	when they had said goodbye, sirius's face had been gaunt and sunken, surrounded by a quantity of long, black, matted hair  but the hair was short and clean now, sirius's face was fuller, and he looked younger, much more like the only photograph harry had of him, which had been taken at the potters' wedding
	never mind me, how are you said sirius seriously
	i'm   for a second, harry tried to say fine  but he couldn't do it
	before he could stop himself, he was talking more than he'd talked in days  about how no one believed he hadn't entered the tournament of his own free will, how rita skeeter had lied about him in the daily prophet, how he couldn't walk down a corridor without being sneered at  and about ron, ron not believing him, ron's jealousy
	and now hagrid's just shown me what's coming in the first task, and it's dragons, sirius, and i'm a goner, he finished desperately
	sirius looked at him, eyes full of concern, eyes that had not yet lost the look that azkaban had given them  that deadened, haunted look  he had let harry talk himself into silence without interruption, but now he said, dragons we can deal with, harry, but we'll get to that in a minute  i haven't got long here
	i've broken into a wizarding house to use the fire, but they could be back at any time
	there are things i need to warn you about
	what  said harry, feeling his spirits slip a further few notches
	surely there could be nothing worse than dragons comingkarkaroff, said sirius
	harry, he was a death eater
	you know what death eaters are, don't youyes  he  whathe was caught, he was in azkaban with me, but he got released
	i'd bet everything that's why dumbledore wanted an auror at hogwarts this year  to keep an eye on him
	moody caught karkaroff
	put him into azkaban in the first place
	karkaroff got released  harry said slowly  his brain seemed to be struggling to absorb yet another piece of shocking information
	why did they release himhe did a deal with the ministry of magic, said sirius bitterly
	he said he'd seen the error of his ways, and then he named names
	he put a load of other people into azkaban in his place
	he's not very popular in there, i can tell you
	and since he got out, from what i can tell, he's been teaching the dark arts to every student who passes through that school of his
	so watch out for the durmstrang champion as well
	okay, said harry slowly
	are you saying karkaroff put my name in the goblet  because if he did, he's a really good actor
	he seemed furious about it
	he wanted to stop me from competing
	we know he's a good actor, said sirius, because he convinced the ministry of magic to set him free, didn't he  now, i've been keeping an eye on the daily prophet, harry
	you and the rest of the world, said harry bitterly
	and reading between the lines of that skeeter woman's article last month, moody was attacked the night before he started at hogwarts
	yes, i know she says it was another false alarm, sirius said hastily, seeing harry about to speak, but i don't think so, somehow
	i think someone tried to stop him from getting to hogwarts
	i think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around
	and no one's going to look into it too closely madeye's heard intruders a bit too often
	but that doesn't mean he can't still spot the real thing
	moody was the best auror the ministry ever had
	what are you saying  said harry slowly
	karkaroff's trying to kill me  but  whysirius hesitated
	i've been nearing some very strange things, he said slowly
	the death eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately
	they showed themselves at the quidditch world cup, didn't they  someone set off the dark mark
	and then  did you hear about that ministry of magic witch who's gone missingbertha jorkins said harry
	she disappeared in albania, and that's definitely where voldemort was rumored to be last
	and she would have known the triwizard tournament was coming up, wouldn't sheyeah, but
	it's not very likely she'd have walked straight into voldemort, is it said harry
	listen, i knew bertha jorkins, said sirius grimly
	she was at hogwarts when i was, a few years above your dad and me
	and she was an idiot
	very nosy, but no brains, none at all
	it's not a good combination, harry
	i'd say she'd be very easy to lure into a trap
	so voldemort could have found out about the tournament  said harry
	is that what you mean  you think karkaroff might be here on his ordersi don't know, said sirius slowly, i just don't know
	karkaroff doesn't strike me as the type who'd go back to voldemort unless he knew voldemort was powerful enough to protect him
	but whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a reason, and i can't help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to attack you and make it hook like an accident
	looks hike a really good plan from where i'm standing, said harry grinning bleaky
	they'll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff
	right  these dragons, said sirius, speaking very quickly now
	there's a way, harry
	don't be tempted to try a stunning spell  dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single stunner, you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon yeah, i know, i just saw, said harry
	but you can do it alone, said sirius
	there is away, and a simple spell's all you need
	just but harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart suddenly pounding as though it would burst
	he could hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase behind him
	go  he hissed at sirius
	go  there's someone comingharry scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire  if someone saw sirius's face within the walls of hogwarts, they would raise an almighty uproar  the ministry would get dragged in  he, harry, would be questioned about sirius's whereabouts  harry heard a tiny pop in the fire behind him and knew sirius had gone
	he watched the bottom of the spiral staircase
	who had decided to go for a stroll at one o'clock in the morning, and stopped sirius from telling him how to get past a dragonit was ron
	dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas, ron stopped dead facing harry across the room, and looked around
	who were you talking to he said
	what's that got to do with you  harry snarled
	what are you doing down here at this time of nighti just wondered where you   ron broke off, shrugging
	i'm going back to bed
	just thought you'd come nosing around, did you  harry shouted
	he knew that ron had no idea what he'd walked in on, knew he hadn't done it on purpose, but he didn't care  at this moment he hated everything about ron, right down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama trousers
	sorry about that, said ron, his face reddening with anger
	should've realized you didn't want to be disturbed
	i'll let you get on with practicing for your next interview in peace
	harry seized one of the potter really stinks badges off the table and chucked it, as hard as he could, across the room
	it hit ron on the forehead and bounced off
	there you go, harry said
	something for you to wear on tuesday
	you might even have a scar now, if yon're lucky
	that's what you want, isn't ithe strode across the room toward the stairs he half expected ron to stop him, he would even have liked ron to throw a punch at him, but ron just stood there in his toosmall pajamas, and harry, having stormed upstairs, lay awake in bed fuming for a long time afterward and didn't hear him come up to bed
	chapter twenty  the first taskharry got up on sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while before he realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his sock
	when he'd finally got all his clothes on the right parts of his body, he hurried off to find hermione, locating her at the gryffindor table in the great hall, where she was eating breakfast with ginny
	feeling too queasy to eat, harry waited until hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge, then dragged her out onto the grounds
	there, he told her all about the dragons, and about everything sirius had said, while they took another long walk around the lake
	alarmed as she was by sirius's warnings about karkaroff, hermione still thought that the dragons were the more pressing problem
	let's just try and keep you alive until tuesday evening, she said desperately, and then we can worry about karkaroff
	they walked three times around the lake, trying all the way to think of a simple spell that would subdue a dragon
	nothing whatsoever occurred to them, so they retired to the library instead
	here, harry pulled down every book he could find on dragons, and both of them set to work searching through the large pile
	talonclipping by charms
	' this is no good, this is for nutters like hagrid who want to keep them healthy
	dragons are extremely difficult to slay, owing to the ancient magic that imbues their thick hides, which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate
	' but sirius said a simple one would do it
	let's try some simple spellbooks, then, said harry, throwing aside men who love dragons too much
	he returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks, set them down, and began to flick through each in turn, hermione whispering nonstop at his elbow
	well, there are switching spells
	but what's the point of switching it  unless you swapped its fangs for winegums or something that would make it less dangerous
	the trouble is, like that book said, not much is going to get through a dragon's hide
	i'd say transfigure it, but something that big, you really haven't got a hope, i doubt even professor mcgonagall
	unless you're supposed to put the spell on yourself  maybe to give yourself extra powers  but they're not simple spells, i mean, we haven't done any of those in class, i only know about them because i've been doing o
	hermione, harry said, through gritted teeth, will you shut up for a bit, please  i m trying to concentrate
	but all that happened, when hermione fell silent, was that harry's brain filled with a sort of blank buzzing, which didn't seem to allow room for concentration
	he stared hopelessly down the index of basic hexes for the busy and vexed
	but dragons had no hair
	that would probably increase a dragon's firepower
	just what he needed, to give it an extra weapon
	oh no, he's back again, why can't he read on his stupid ship  said hermione irritably as viktor krum slouched in, cast a surly look over at the pair of them, and settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of books
	come on, harry, we'll go back to the common room
	his fan club'll be here in a moment, twittering away
	and sure enough, as they left the library, a gang of girls tiptoed past them, one of them wearing a bulgaria scarf tied around her waist
	harry barely slept that night
	when he awoke on monday morning, he seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from hogwarts
	but as he looked around the great hall at breakfast time, and thought about what leaving the castle would mean, he knew he couldn't do it
	it was the only place he had ever been happy
	well, he supposed he must have been happy with his parents too, but he couldn't remember that
	somehow, the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on privet drive with dudley was good to know it made him feel slightly calmer
	he finished his bacon with difficulty his throat wasn't working too well, and as he and hermione got up, he saw cedric diggory leaving the hufflepuff table
	cedric still didn't know about the dragons
	the only champion who didn't, if harry was right in thinking that maxime and karkaroff would have told fleur and krum
	hermione, i'll see you in the greenhouses, harry said, coming to his decision as he watched cedric leaving the hall
	go on, i'll catch you up
	harry, you'll be late, the bell's about to ring i'll catch you up, okayby the time harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase, cedric was at the top
	he was with a load of sixthyear friends
	harry didn't want to talk to cedric in front of them they were among those who had been quoting rita skeeter's article at him every time he went near them
	he followed cedric at a distance and saw that he was heading toward the charms corridor
	this gave harry an idea
	pausing at a distance from them, he pulled out his wand, and took careful aim
	diffindocedric's bag split
	parchment, quills, and books spilled out of it onto the floor
	several bottles of ink smashed
	don't bother, said cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends bent down to help him
	tell flitwick i'm coming, go on
	this was exactly what harry had been hoping for
	he slipped his wand back into his robes, waited until cedric's friends had disappeared into their classroom, and hurried up the corridor, which was now empty of everyone but himself and cedric
	hi, said cedric, picking up a copy of a guide to advanced transfiguration that was now splattered with ink
	cedric, said harry, the first task is dragons
	what said cedric, looking up
	dragons, said harry, speaking quickly, in case professor flitwick came out to see where cedric had got to
	they've got four, one for each of us, and we've got to get past them
	harry saw some of the panic he'd been feeling since saturday night flickering in cedric's gray eyes
	are you sure cedric said in a hushed voice
	dead sure, said harry
	but how did you find out  we're not supposed to know
	never mind, said harry quickly  he knew hagrid would be in trouble if he told the truth
	but i'm not the only one who knows
	fleur and krum will know by now  maxime and karkaroff both saw the dragons too
	cedric straightened up, his arms full of inky quills, parchment, and books, his ripped bag dangling off one shoulder
	he stared at harry, and there was a puzzled, almost suspicious look in his eyes
	why are you telling me he asked
	harry looked at him in disbelief
	he was sure cedric wouldn't have asked that if he had seen the dragons himself
	harry wouldn't have let his worst enemy face those monsters unprepared  well, perhaps malfoy or snape
	fair, isn't it  he said to cedric
	we're on an even footing, aren't wecedric was still hooking at him in a slightly suspicious way when harry heard a familiar clunking noise behind him
	he turned around and saw madeye moody emerging from a nearby classroom
	come with me, potter, he growled
	diggory, off you go
	harry stared apprehensively at moody
	had he overheard themer  professor, i'm supposed to be in herbology never mind that, potter
	in my office, please
	harry followed him, wondering what was going to happen to him now
	what if moody wanted to know how he'd found out about the dragons  would moody go to dumbledore and tell on hagrid, or just turn harry into a ferret  well, it might be easier to get past a dragon if he were a ferret, harry thought dully, he'd be smaller, much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet
	he followed moody into his office
	moody closed the door behind them and turned to look at harry, his magical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal one
	that was a very decent thing you just did, potter, moody said quietly
	harry didn't know what to say this wasn't the reaction he had expected at all
	sit down, said moody, and harry sat, looking around
	he had visited this office under two of its previous occupants
	in professor lockhart's day, the walls had been plastered with beaming, winking pictures of professor lockhart himself
	when lupin had lived here, you were more likely to come across a specimen of some fascinating new dark creature he had procured for them to study in class
	now, however, the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that harry supposed moody had used in the days when he had been an auror
	on his desk stood what looked hike a large, cracked, glass spinning top harry recognized it at once as a sneakoscope, because he owned one himself, though it was much smaller than moody's
	in the corner on a small table stood an object that looked something like an extrasquiggly, golden television aerial
	it was humming slightly
	what appeared to be a mirror hung opposite harry on the wall, but it was not reflecting the room
	shadowy figures were moving around inside it, none of them clearly in focus
	like my dark detectors, do you s aid moody, who was watching harry closely
	what's that  harry asked, pointing at the squiggly golden aerial
	vibrates when it detects concealment and lies
	no use here, of course, too much interference  students in every direction lying about why they haven't done their homework  been humming ever since i got here
	i had to disable my sneakoscope because it wouldn't stop whistling
	it's extrasensitive, picks up stuff about a mile around
	of course, it could be picking up more than kid stuff, he added in a growl
	and what's the mirror foroh that's my foeglass
	see them out there, skulking around  i'm not really in trouble until i see the whites of their eyes
	that's when i open my trunk
	he let out a short, harsh laugh, and pointed to the large trunk under the window
	it had seven keyholes in a row
	harry wondered what was in there, until moody's next question brought him sharply back to earth
	found out about the dragons, have youharry hesitated
	he'd been afraid of this  but he hadn't told cedric, and he certainly wasn't going to tell moody, that hagrid had broken the rules
	it's all right, said moody, sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg with a groan
	cheating's a traditional part of the triwizard tournament and always has been
	i didn't cheat, said harry sharply
	it was  a sort of accident that i found out
	i wasn't accusing you, laddie
	i've been telling dumbledore from the start, he can be as highminded as he likes, but you can bet old karkaroff and maxime won't be
	they'll have told their champions everything they can
	they want to beat dumbledore
	they'd like to prove he's only human
	moody gave another harsh laugh, and his magical eye swiveled around so fast it made harry feel queasy to watch it
	got any ideas how you're going to get past your dragon yet said moody
	well, i'm not going to tell you, said moody gruffly
	i don't show favoritism, me
	i'm just going to give you some good, general advice
	and the first bit is  play to your strengths
	i haven't got any, said harry, before he could stop himself
	excuse me, growled moody, you've got strengths if i say you've got them
	what are you best atharry tried to concentrate
	what was he best at  well, that was easy, really quidditch, he said dully, and a fat lot of help  that's right, said moody, staring at him very hard, his magical eye barely moving at all
	you're a damn good flier from what i've heard
	i'm not allowed a broom, i've only got my wand
	my second piece of general advice, said moody loudly, interrupting him, is to use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to get what you need
	harry looked at him blankly
	what did he needcome on, boy
	it's not that difficult
	he was best at flying
	he needed to pass the dragon in the air
	for that, he needed his firebolt
	and for his firebolt, he needed  hermione, harry whispered, when he had sped into greenhouse three minutes later, uttering a hurried apology to professor sprout as he passed her
	hermione  i need you to help me
	what d'you think i've been trying to do, harry  she whispered back, her eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering flutterby bush she was pruning
	hermione, i need to learn how to do a summoning charm properly by tomorrow afternoon
	and so they practiced
	they didn't have lunch, but headed for a free classroom, where harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room toward him
	he was still having problems
	the books and quills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping hike stones to the floor
	concentrate, harry, concentrate
	what d'you think i'm trying to do  said harry angrily
	a great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason
	he wanted to skip divination to keep practicing, but hermione refused pointblank to skive off arithmancy, and there was no point in staying without her
	he therefore had to endure over an hour of professor trelawney, who spent half the lesson telling everyone that the position of mars with relation to saturn at that moment meant that people born in july were in great danger of sudden, violent deaths
	well, that's good, said harry loudly, his temper getting the better of him, just as long as it's not drawnout
	i don't want to suffer
	ron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh he certainly caught harry's eye for the first time in days, but harry was still feeling too resentful toward ron to care
	he spent the rest of the lesson trying to attract small objects toward him under the table with his wand
	he managed to make a fly zoom straight into his hand, though he wasn't entirely sure that was his prowess at summoning charms  perhaps the fly was just stupid
	he forced down some dinner after divination, then returned to the empty classroom with hermione, using the invisibility cloak to avoid the teachers
	they kept practicing until past midnight
	they would have stayed longer, but peeves turned up and, pretending to think that harry wanted things thrown at him, started chucking chairs across the room
	harry and hermione left in a hurry before the noise attracted filch, and went back to the gryffindor common room, which was now mercifully empty
	at two o'clock in the morning, harry stood near the fireplace, surrounded by heaps of objects  books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of gobstones, and neville's toad, trevor
	only in the last hour had harry really got the hang of the summoning charm
	that's better, harry, that's loads better, hermione said, looking exhausted but very pleased
	well, now we know what to do next time i can't manage a spell, harry said, throwing a rune dictionary back to hermione, so he could try again, threaten me with a dragon
	he raised his wand once more
	accio dictionarythe heavy book soared out of hermione's hand, flew across the room, and harry caught it
	harry, i really think you've got it said hermione delightedly
	just as long as it works tomorrow, harry said
	the firebolt's going to be much farther away than the stuff in here, it's going to be in the castle, and i'm going to be out there on the grounds
	that doesn't matter, said hermione firmly
	just as long as you're concentrating really, really hard on it, it'll come
	harry, we'd better get some sleep
	you're going to need it
	harry had been focusing so hard on learning the summoning charm that evening that some of his blind panic had heft him
	it returned in full measure, however, on the following morning
	the atmosphere in the school was one of great tension and excitement
	lessons were to stop at midday, giving all the students time to get down to the dragons' enclosure  though of course, they didn't yet know what they would find there
	harry felt oddly separate from everyone around him, whether they were wishing him good luck or hissing we'll have a box of tissues ready, potter as he passed
	it was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he mightn't just lose his head when they tried to lead him out to his dragon, and start trying to curse everyone in sight
	time was behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever, rushing past in great dollops, so that one moment he seemed to be sitting down in his first lesson, history of magic, and the next, walking into lunch
	and then where had the morning gone  the last of the dragonfree hours, professor mcgonagall was hurrying over to him in the great hall
	lots of people were watching
	potter, the champions have to come down onto the grounds now
	you have to get ready for your first task
	okay, said harry, standing up, his fork falling onto his plate with a clatter
	good luck, harry, hermione whispered
	you'll be fineyeah, said harry in a voice that was most unlike his own
	he heft the great hall with professor mcgonagall
	she didn't seem herself either in fact, she looked nearly as anxious as hermione
	as she walked him down the stone steps and out into the cold november afternoon, she put her hand on his shoulder
	now, don't panic, she said, just keep a cool head
	we've got wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of hand
	the main thing is just to do your best, and nobody will think any the worse of you
	are you all rightyes, harry heard himself say
	she was leading him toward the place where the dragons were, around the edge of the forest, but when they approached the clump of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible, harry saw that a tent had been erected, its entrance facing them, screening the dragons from view
	you're to go in here with the other champions, said professor mcgonagall, in a rather shaky sort of voice, and wait for your turn, potter
	he'll be telling you the  the procedure
	thanks, said harry, in a flat, distant voice
	she left him at the entrance of the tent
	fleur delacour was sitting in a corner on a how wooden stool
	she didn't look nearly as composed as usual, but rather pale and clammy
	viktor krum looked even surlier than usual, which harry supposed was his way of showing nerves
	cedric was pacing up and down
	when harry entered, cedric gave him a small smile, which harry returned, feeling the muscles in his face working rather hard, as though they had forgotten how to do it
	harry  goodo said bagman happily, looking around at him
	come in, come in, make yourself at homebagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure, standing amid all the palefaced champions
	he was wearing his old wasp robes again
	well, now we're all here  time to fill you in said bagman brightly
	when the audience has assembled, i'm going to be offering each of you this bag  he held up a small sack of purple silk and shook it at them  from which you will each select a small model of the thing you are about to face  there are different  er  varieties, you see
	and i have to tell you something else too
	your task is to collect the golden eggharry glanced around
	cedric had nodded once, to show that he understood bagman's words, and then started pacing around the tent again he looked slightly green
	fleur delacour and krum hadn't reacted at all
	perhaps they thought they might be sick if they opened their mouths that was certainly how harry felt
	but they, at least, had volunteered for this
	and in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could be heard passing the tent, their owners talking excitedly, laughing, joking
	harry felt as separate from the crowd as though they were a different species
	and then  it seemed like about a second later to harry  bagman was opening the neck of the purple silk sack
	ladies first, he said, offering it to fleur delacour
	she put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny, perfect model of a dragon  a welsh green
	it had the number two around its neck  and harry knew, by the fact that fleur showed no sign of surprise, but rather a determined resignation, that he had been right madame maxime had told her what was coming
	the same held true for krum
	he pulled out the scarlet chinese fireball
	it had a number three around its neck
	he didn't even blink, just sat back down and stared at the ground
	cedric put his hand into the bag, and out came the blueishgray swedish shortsnout, the number one tied around its neck
	knowing what was left, harry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the hungarian horntail, and the number four
	it stretched its wings as he looked down at it, and bared its minuscule fangs
	well, there you are said bagman
	you have each pulled out the dragon you will face, and the numbers refer to the order in which you are to take on the dragons, do you see now, i'm going to have to leave you in a moment, because i'm commentating
	diggory, you're first, just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle, all right  now
	could i have a quick word  outsideer
	yes, said harry blankly, and he got up and went out of the tent with bagman, who walked him a short distance away, into the trees, and then turned to him with a fatherly expression on his face
	feeling all right, harry  anything i can get youwhat said harry
	got a plan  said bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially
	because i don't mind sharing a few pointers, if you'd like them, you know
	i mean, bagman continued, lowering his voice still further, you're the underdog here, harry
	anything i can do to help
	no, said harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude, no  i  i know what i'm going to do, thanks
	nobody would know, harry, said bagman, winking at him
	no, i'm fine, said harry, wondering why he kept telling people this, and wondering whether he had ever been less fine
	i've got a plan worked out, i a whistle had blown somewhere
	good lord, i've got to run  said bagman in alarm, and he hurried off
	harry walked back to the tent and saw cedric emerging from it, greener than ever
	harry tried to wish him luck as he walked past, but all that came out of his mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt
	harry went back inside to fleur and krum
	seconds hater, they heard the roar of the crowd, which meant cedric had entered the enclosure and was now facetoface with the living counterpart of his model
	it was worse than harry could ever have imagined, sitting there and listening
	gasped like a single manyheaded entity, as cedric did whatever he was doing to get past the swedish shortsnout
	krum was still staring at the ground
	fleur had now taken to retracing cedric's steps, around and around the tent
	and bagman's commentary made everything much, much worse
	horrible pictures formed in harry's mind as he heard  oooh, narrow miss there, very narrow
	he's taking risks, this one
	clever move  pity it didn't workand then, after about fifteen minutes, harry heard the deafening roar that could mean only one thing cedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the golden egg
	very good indeed  bagman was shouting
	and now the marks from the judgesbut he didn't shout out the marks harry supposed the judges were holding them up and showing them to the crowd
	one down, three to go  bagman yelled as the whistle blew again
	miss delacour, if you pleasefleur was trembling from head to foot harry felt more warmly toward her than he had done so far as she heft the tent with her head held high and her hand clutching her wand
	he and krum were left alone, at opposite sides of the tent, avoiding each other's gaze
	the same process started again
	oh i'm not sure that was wise  they could hear bagman shouting gleefully
	good lord, i thought she'd had it thenten minutes later, harry heard the crowd erupt into applause once more
	fleur must have been successful too
	a pause, while fleur's marks were being shown
	then, for the third time, the whistle
	krum  cried bagman, and krum slouched out, leaving harry quite alone
	he felt much more aware of his body than usual very aware of the way his heart was pumping fast, and his fingers tingling with fear
	yet at the same time, he seemed to be outside himself, seeing the walls of the tent, and hearing the crowd, as though from far away
	very daring  bagman was yelling, and harry heard the chinese fireball emit a horrible, roaring shriek, while the crowd drew its collective breath
	that's some nerve he's showing  and  yes, he's got the eggapplause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass krum had finished  it would be harry's turn any moment
	he stood up, noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of marshmallow
	and then he heard the whistle blow
	he walked out through the entrance of the tent, the panic rising into a crescendo inside him
	and now he was walking past the trees, through a gap in the enclosure fence
	he saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly colored dream
	there were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands that had been magicked there since he'd last stood on this spot
	and there was the horntail, at the other end of the enclosure, crouched low over her clutch of eggs, her wings halffurled, her evil, yellow eyes upon him, a monstrous, scaly, black lizard, thrashing her spiked tail, heaving yardlong gouge marks in the hard ground
	the crowd was making a great deal of noise, but whether friendly or not, harry didn't know or care
	it was time to do what he had to do
	to focus his mind, entirely and absolutely, upon the thing that was his only chance
	accio firebolt he shouted
	harry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying
	he seemed to be looking at everything around him through some sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat haze, which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim strangely
	and then he heard it, speeding through the air behind him he turned and saw his firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods, soaring into the enclosure, and stopping dead in midair beside him, waiting for him to mount
	the crowd was making even more noise
	bagman was shouting something
	but harry's ears were not working properly anymore
	listening wasn't important
	he swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground
	and a second later, something miraculous happened
	as he soared upward, as the wind rushed through his hair, as the crowd's faces became mere fleshcolored pinpnicks below, and the horntail shrank to the size of a dog, he realized that he had heft not only the ground behind, but also his fear
	he was back where he belonged
	this was just another quidditch match, that was all
	just another quidditch match, and that horntail was just another ugly opposing team
	he looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one, gleaming against its cementcolored fellows, residing safely between the dragon's front legs
	okay, harry told himself, diversionary tactics
	the horntail's head followed him he knew what it was going to do and pulled out of the dive just in time a jet of fire had been released exactly where he would have been had he not swerved away
	but harry didn't care
	that was no more than dodging a bludger
	great scott, he can fly  yelled bagman as the crowd shrieked and gasped
	are you watching this, mr
	krumharry soared higher in a circle the horntail was still following his progress its head revolving on its long neck  if he kept this up, it would be nicely dizzy  but better not push it too long, or it would be breathing fire again  harry plummeted just as the horntail opened its mouth, but this time he was less lucky  he missed the flames, but the tail came whipping up to meet him instead, and as he swerved to the left, one of the long spikes grazed his shoulder, ripping his robes he could feel it stinging, he could hear screaming and groans from the crowd, but the cut didn't seem to be deep
	now he zoomed around the back of the horntail, and a possibility occurred to him
	the horntail didn't seem to want to take off, she was too protective of her eggs
	though she writhed and twisted, furling and unfurling her wings and keeping those fearsome yellow eyes on harry, she was afraid to move too far from them
	but he had to persuade her to do it, or he'd never get near them
	the trick was to do it carefully, gradually
	he began to fly, first this way, then the other, not near enough to make her breathe fire to stave him off, but still posing a sufficient threat to ensure she kept her eyes on him
	her head swayed this way and that, watching him out of those vertical pupils, her fangs bared
	the horntail's head rose with him, her neck now stretched to its fullest extent, still swaying, hike a snake before its charmer
	harry rose a few more feet, and she let out a roar of exasperation
	he was like a fly to her, a fly she was longing to swat her tail thrashed again, but he was too high to reach now
	she shot fire into the air, which he dodged
	her jaws opened wide
	come on, harry hissed, swerving tantalizingly above her, come on, come and get me
	and then she reared, spreading her great, black, leathery wings at last, as wide as those of a small airplane  and harry dived
	before the dragon knew what he had done, or where he had disappeared to, he was speeding toward the ground as fast as he could go, toward the eggs now unprotected by her clawed front legs  he had taken his hands off his firebolt  he had seized the golden egg  and with a huge spurt of speed, he was off, he was soaring out over the stands, the heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm, and it was as though somebody had just turned the volume back up  for the first time, he became properly aware of the noise of the crowd, which was screaming and applauding as loudly as the irish supporters at the world cup  look at that bagman was yelling
	will you look at that our youngest champion is quickest to get his egg  well, this is going to shorten the odds on mr
	potterharry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the horntail, and, over at the entrance to the enclosure, professor mcgonagalh, professor moody, and hagrid hurrying to meet him, all of them waving him toward them, their smiles evident even from this distance
	he flew back over the stands, the noise of the crowd pounding his eardrums, and came in smoothly to land, his heart lighter than it had been in weeks
	he had got through the first task, he had survived
	that was excellent, potter  cried professor mcgonagall as he got off the firebolt  which from her was extravagant praise
	he noticed that her hand shook as she pointed at his shoulder
	you'll need to see madam pomfrey before the judges give out your score
	over there, she's had to mop up diggory already
	yeh did it, harry said hagrid hoarsely
	yeh did it  an' agains' the horntail an' all, an' yeh know charlie said that was the wors'  thanks, hagrid, said harry loudly, so that hagrid wouldn't blunder on and reveal that he had shown harry the dragons beforehand
	professor moody looked very pleased too his magical eye was dancing in its socket
	nice and easy does the trick, potter, he growled
	right then, potter, the first aid tent, please
	said professor mcgonagall
	harry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and saw madam pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent, looking worried
	dragons  she said, in a disgusted tone, pulling harry inside
	the tent was divided into cubicles he could make out cedric's shadow through the canvas, but cedric didn't seem to be badly injured he was sitting up, at least
	madam pomfrey examined harry's shoulder, talking furiously all the while
	last year dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school next  you're very lucky
	this is quite shallow
	it'll need cleaning before i heal it up, though
	she cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and stung, but then poked his shoulder with her wand, and he felt it heal instantly
	now, just sit quietly for a minute  sit  and then you can go and get your score
	she bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say, how does it feel now, diggoryharry didn't want to sit still  he was too full of adrenaline
	he got to his feet, wanting to see what was going on outside, but before he'd reached the mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside  hermione, followed closely by ron
	harry, you were brilliant   hermione said squeakily
	there were fingernail marks on her face where she had been clutching it in fear
	you were amazing  you really werebut harry was looking at ron, who was very white and staring at harry as though he were a ghost
	harry, he said, very seriously, whoever put your name in that goblet  i  i reckon they're trying to do you init was as though the last few weeks had never happened  as though harry were meeting ron for the first time, right after he'd been made champion
	caught on, have you  said harry coldly
	took you long enough
	hermione stood nervously between them, looking from one to the other
	ron opened his mouth uncertainly
	harry knew ron was about to apologize and suddenly he found he didn't need to hear it
	it's okay, he said, before ron could get the words out
	no, said ron, i shouldn't've forget it, harry said
	ron grinned nervously at him, and harry grinned back hermione burst into tears
	there's nothing to cry about  harry told her, bewildered
	you two are so stupid she shouted, stamping her foot on the ground, tears splashing down her front
	then, before either of them could stop her, she had given both of them a hug and dashed away, now positively howling
	barking mad, said ron, shaking his head
	harry, c'mon, they'll be putting up your scores
	picking up the golden egg and his firebolt, feeling more elated than he would have believed possible an hour ago, harry ducked out of the tent, ron by his side, talking fast
	you were the best, you know, no competition
	cedric did this weird thing where he transfigured a rock on the ground
	turned it into a dog
	he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him
	well, it was a pretty cool bit of transfiguration, and it sort of worked, because he did get the egg, but he got burned as well  the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have him than the labrador he only just got away
	and that fleur girl tried this sort of charm, i think she was trying to put it into a trance  well, that kind of worked too, it went all sleepy, but then it snored, and this great jet of flame shot out, and her skirt caught fire  she put it out with a bit of water out of her wand
	and krum  you won't believe this, but he didn't even think of flying  he was probably the best after you, though
	hit it with some sort of spell right in the eye
	only thing is, it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs  they took marks off for that, he wasn't supposed to do any damage to them
	ron drew breath as he and harry reached the edge of the enclosure
	now that the horntail had been taken away, harry could see where the five judges were sitting  right at the other end, in raised seats draped in gold
	it's marks out of ten from each one, ron said, and harry squinting up the field, saw the first judge  madame maxime  raise her wand in the air
	what hooked like a long silver ribbon shot out of it, which twisted itself into a large figure eight
	not bad said ron as the crowd applauded
	i suppose she took marks off for your shoulder
	he shot a number nine into the air
	looking good  ron yelled, thumping harry on the back
	he too put up a nine
	the crowd was cheering harder than ever
	ten said harry in disbelief
	what's he playing atharry, don't complain ron yelled excitedly
	and now karkaroff raised his wand
	he paused for a moment, and then a number shot out of his wand too  four
	what ron bellowed furiously
	four  you lousy, biased scumbag, you gave krum tenbut harry didn't care, he wouldn't have cared if karkaroff had given him zero ron's indignation on his behalf was worth about a hundred points to him
	he didn't tell ron this, of course, but his heart felt lighter than air as he turned to leave the enclosure
	and it wasn't just ron
	those weren't only gryffindors cheering in the crowd
	when it had come to it, when they had seen what he was facing, most of the school had been on his side as well as cedric's
	he didn't care about the slytherins, he could stand whatever they threw at him now
	you're tied in first place, harry  you and krum  said charlie weasley, hurrying to meet them as they set off back toward the school
	listen, i've got to run, i've got to go and send mum an owl, i swore i'd tell her what happened  but that was unbelievable  oh yeah  and they told me to tell you you've got to hang around for a few more minutes
	bagman wants a word, back in the champions' tent
	ron said he would wait, so harry reentered the tent, which somehow looked quite different now  friendly and welcoming
	he thought back to how he'd felt while dodging the horntail, and compared it to the long wait before he'd walked out to face it
	there was no comparison the wait had been immeasurably worse
	fleur, cedric, and krum all came in together
	one side of cedric's face was covered in a thick orange paste, which was presumably mending his burn
	he grinned at harry when he saw him
	and you, said harry, grinning back
	well done, all of you  said ludo bagman, bouncing into the tent and looking as pleased as though he personally had just got past a dragon
	now, just a quick few words
	you've got a nice long break before the second task, which will take place at half past nine on the morning of february the twentyfourth  but we're giving you something to think about in the meantime  if you look down at those golden eggs you're all holding, you will see that they open
	see the hinges there  you need to solve the clue inside the egg  because it will tell you what the second task is, and enable you to prepare for it  all clear  sure  well, off you go, thenharry left the tent, rejoined ron, and they started to walk back around the edge of the forest, talking hard harry wanted to hear what the other champions had done in more detail
	then, as they rounded the clump of trees behind which harry had first heard the dragons roar, a witch leapt out from behind them
	she was wearing acidgreen robes today the quickquotes quill in her hand blended perfectly against them
	congratulations, harry  she said, beaming at him
	i wonder if you could give me a quick word  how you felt facing that dragon  how you feel now, about the fairness of the scoringyeah, you can have a word, said harry savagely
	and he set off back to the castle with ron
	chapter twentyone  the houseelf liberation frontharry, ron, and hermione went up to the owlery that evening to find pigwidgeon, so that harry could send sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get past his dragon unscathed
	on the way, harry filled ron in on everything sirius had told him about karkaroff
	though shocked at first to hear that karkaroff had been a death eater, by the time they entered the owlery ron was saying that they ought to have suspected it all along
	fits, doesn't it  he said
	remember what malfoy said on the train, about his dad being friends with karkaroff  now we know where they knew each other
	they were probably running around in masks together at the world cup
	i'll tell you one thing, though, harry, if it was karkaroff who put your name in the goblet, he's going to be feeling really stupid now, isn't he  didn't work, did it  you only got a scratch  come here  i'll do it pigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery he was flying around and around harry's head, hooting incessantly
	ron snatched pigwidgeon out of the air and held him still while harry attached the letter to his leg
	there's no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous, how could they be  ron went on as he carried pigwidgeon to the window
	you know what i reckon you could win this tournament, harry, i'm serious
	harry knew that ron was only saying this to make up for his behavior of the last few weeks, but he appreciated it all the same
	hermione, however, leaned against the owlery wall, folded her arms, and frowned at ron
	harry's got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament, she said seriously
	if that was the first task, i hate to think what's coming next
	right little ray of sunshine, aren't you  said ron
	you and professor trelawney should get together sometime
	he threw pigwidgeon out of the window
	pigwidgeon plummeted twelve feet before managing to pull himself back up again the letter attached to his leg was much longer and heavier than usual  harry hadn't been able to resist giving sirius a blowbyblow account of exactly how he had swerved, circled, and dodged the horntail
	they watched pigwidgeon disappear into the darkness, and then ron said, well, we'd better get downstairs for your surprise party, harry  fred and george should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by now
	sure enough, when they entered the gryffindor common room it exploded with cheers and yells again
	there were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface lee jordan had let off some filibuster's fireworks, so that the air was thick with stars and sparks and dean thomas, who was very good at drawing, had put up some impressive new banners, most of which depicted harry zooming around the horntail's head on his firebolt, though a couple showed cedric with his head on fire
	harry helped himself to food he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with ron and hermione
	he couldn't believe how happy he felt he had ron back on his side, he'd gotten through the first task, and he wouldn't have to face the second one for three months
	blimey, this is heavy, said lee jordan, picking up the golden egg, which harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands
	open it, harry, go on  let's just see what's inside ithe's supposed to work out the clue on his own, hermione said swiftly
	it's in the tournament rules
	i was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too, harry muttered, so only hermione could hear him, and she grinned rather guiltily
	yeah, go on, harry, open it  several people echoed
	lee passed harry the egg, and harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open
	it was hollow and completely empty  but the moment harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room
	the nearest thing to it harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at nearly headless nick's deathday party, who had all been playing the musical saw
	shut it  fred bellowed, his hands over his ears
	what was that  said seamus finnigan, staring at the egg as harry slammed it shut again
	sounded like a banshee
	maybe you've got to get past one of those next, harryit was someone being tortured said neville, who had gone very white and spilled sausage rolls all over the floor
	you're going to have to fight the cruciatus cursedon't be a prat, neville, that's illegal, said george
	they wouldn't use the cruciatus curse on the champions
	i thought it sounded a bit like percy singing
	maybe you've got to attack him while he's in the shower
	want a jam tart, hermione said fred
	hermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering her
	it's all right, he said
	i haven't done anything to them
	it's the custard creams you've got to watch neville, who had just bitten into a custard cream, choked and spat it out
	just my little joke, neville
	hermione took a jam tart
	then she said, did you get all this from the kitchens, fredyep, said fred, grinning at her
	he put on a highpitched squeak and imitated a houseelf
	'anything we can get you, sir, anything at all'  they're dead helpful
	get me a roast ox if i said i was peckish
	how do you get in there hermione said in an innocently casual sort of voice
	easy, said fred, concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit
	just tickle the pear, and it giggles and  he stopped and looked suspiciously at her
	whynothing, said hermione quickly
	going to try and lead the houseelves out on strike now, are you said george
	going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellionseveral people chortled
	hermione didn't answer
	don't you go upsetting them and telling them they've got to take clothes and salaries said fred warningly
	you'll put them off their cookingjust then, neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a large canary
	oh  sorry, neville fred shouted over all the laughter
	i forgot  it was the custardcreams we hexed within a minute, however, neville had molted, and once his feathers had fallen off, he reappeared looking entirely normal
	he even joined in laughing
	canary creams fred shouted to the excitable crowd
	george and i invented them  seven sickles each, a bargainit was nearly one in the morning when harry finally went up to the dormitory with ron, neville, seamus, and dean
	before he pulled the curtains of his fourposter shut
	harry set his tiny model of the hungarian horntail on the table next to his bed, where it yawned, curled up, and closed its eyes
	really, harry thought, as he pulled the hangings on his fourposter closed, hagrid had a point
	they were all right, really, dragons
	the start of december brought wind and sleet to hogwarts
	drafty though the castle always was in winter
	harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every time he passed the durmstrang ship on the lake, which was pitching in the high winds, its black sails billowingagainst the dark skies
	he thought the beauxbatons caravan was likely to be pretty chilly too
	hagrid, he noticed, was keeping madame maxime's horses well provided with their preferred drink of singlemalt whiskey the fumes wafting from the trough in the comer of their paddock was enough to make the entire care of magical creatures class lightheaded
	this was unhelpful, as they were still tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits about them
	i'm not sure whether they hibernate or not, hagrid told the shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch next lesson
	thought we'd jus' try an see if they fancied a kip
	we'll jus' settle 'em down in these boxes
	there were now only ten skrewts left apparently their desire to kill one another had not been exercised out of them
	each of them was now approaching six feet in length
	their thick gray armor their powerful, scuttling legs their fireblasting ends their stings and their suckers, combined to make the skrewts the most repulsive things harry had ever seen
	the class looked dispiritedly at the enormous boxes hagrid had brought out, all lined with pillows and fluffy blankets
	we'll jus' lead 'em in here, hagrid said, an' put the lids on, and we'll see what happens
	but the skrewts, it transpired, did not hibernate, and did not appreciate being forced into pillowlined boxes and nailed in
	hagrid was soon yelling, don panic, now, don' panic while the skrewts rampaged around the pumpkin patch, now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes
	most of the class  malfoy, crabbe, and goyle in the lead  had fled into hagrid's cabin through the back door and barricaded themselves in harry, ron, and hermione, however, were among those who remained outside trying to help hagrid
	together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of the skrewts, though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts finally, only one skrewt was left
	don' frighten him, now  hagrid shouted as ron and harry used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back
	jus' try an slip the rope 'round his sting, so he won hurt any o' the othersyeah, we wouldn't want that ron shouted angrily as he and harry backed into the wall of hagrid's cabin, still holding the skrewt off with their sparks
	this does look like fun
	rita skeeter was leaning on hagrid's garden fence, looking in at the mayhem
	she was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar today, and her crocodileskin handbag was over her arm
	hagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering harry and ron and flattened it a blast of fire shot out of its end, withering the pumpkin plants nearby
	who're you  hagrid asked rita skeeter as he slipped a loop of rope around the skrewt's sting and tightened it
	rita skeeter, daily prophet reporter, rita replied, beaming at him
	her gold teeth glinted
	thought dumbledore said you weren' allowed inside the school anymore, said hagrid, frowning slightly as he got off the slightly squashed skrewt and started tugging it over to its fellows
	rita acted as though she hadn't heard what hagrid had said
	what are these fascinating creatures called she asked, beaming still more widely
	blastended skrewts, grunted hagrid
	really  said rita, apparently full of lively interest
	i've never heard of them before
	where do they come fromharry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of hagrid's wild black beard, and his heart sank
	where had hagrid got the skrewts from  hermione, who seemed to be thinking along these lines, said quickly, they're very interesting, aren't they  aren't they
	interesting, said harry as she stepped on his foot
	harry  said rita skeeter as she looked around
	so you like care of magical creatures, do you  one of your favorite lessonsyes, said harry stoutly
	hagrid beamed at him
	been teaching long she added to hagrid
	harry noticed her eyes travel over dean who had a nasty cut across one cheek
	lavender whose robes were badly singed, seamus who was nursing several burnt fingers, and then to the cabin windows, where most of the class stood, their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear
	this is o'ny me second year, said hagrid
	i don't suppose you'd like to give an interview, would you  share some of your experience of magical creatures  the prophet does a zoological column every wednesday, as i'm sure you know
	we could feature these  er  bangended scoots
	blastended skrewts, hagrid said eagerly
	er  yeah, why notharry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of communicating it to hagrid without rita skeeter seeing, so he had to stand and watch in silence as hagrid and rita skeeter made arrangements to meet in the three broomsticks for a good long interview later that week
	then the bell rang up at the castle, signaling the end of the lesson
	well, goodbye, harry rita skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with ron and hermione
	until friday night, then, hagridshe'll twist everything he says, harry said under his breath
	just as long as he didn't import those skrewts illegally or anything, said hermione desperately
	they looked at one another  it was exactly the sort of thing hagrid might do
	hagrids been in loads of trouble before, and dumbledores never sacked him, said ron consolingly
	worst that can happen is hagrid'll have to get rid of the skrewts
	did i say worst  i meant best
	harry and hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly more cheerful, went off to lunch
	harry thoroughly enjoyed double divination that afternoon they were still doing star charts and predictions, but now that he and ron were friends once more, the whole thing seemed very funny again
	professor trelawney, who had been so pleased with the pair of them when they had been predicting their own horrific deaths, quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her explanation of the various ways in which pluto could disrupt everyday life
	i would think, she said, in a mystical whisper that did not conceal her obvious annoyance, that some of us  she stared very meaningfully at harry might be a little less  frivolous had they seen what i have seen during my crystal gazing last night
	as i sat here, absorbed in my needlework, the urge to consult the orb overpowered me
	i arose, i settled myself before it, and i gazed into its crystalline depths
	and what do you think i saw gazing back at mean ugly old bat in outsize specs ron muttered under his breath
	harry fought hard to keep his face straight
	parvati and lavender both put their hands over their mouths, looking horrified
	yes, said professor trelawney, nodding impressively, it comes, ever closer, it circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower
	ever lower over the castle
	she stared pointedly at harry, who yawned very widely and obviously
	it'd be a bit more impressive if she hadn't done it about eighty times before, harry said as they finally regained the fresh air of the staircase beneath professor trelawney's room
	but if i'd dropped dead every time she's told me i'm going to, i'd be a medical miracle
	you'd be a sort of extraconcentrated ghost, said ron, chortling, as they passed the bloody baron going in the opposite direction, his wide eyes staring sinisterly
	at least we didn't get homework
	i hope hermione got loads off professor vector, i love not working when she is
	but hermione wasn't at dinner, nor was she in the library when they went to look for her afterward
	the only person in there was viktor krum
	ron hovered behind the bookshelves for a while, watching krum, debating in whispers with harry whether he should ask for an autograph  but then ron realized that six or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books, debating exactly the same thing, and he lost his enthusiasm for the idea
	wonder where she's got to ron said as he and harry went back to gryffindor tower
	but the fat lady had barely begun to swing forward when the sound of racing feet behind them announced hermione's arrival
	harry she panted, skidding to a halt beside him the fat lady stared down at her, eyebrows raised
	harry, you've got to come  you've got to come, the most amazing thing's happened please she seized harry's arm and started to try to drag him back along the corridor
	what's the matter  harry said
	i'll show you when we get there  oh come on, quick harry looked around at ron he looked back at harry, intrigued
	okay, harry said, starting off back down the corridor with hermione, ron hurrying to keep up
	oh don't mind me the fat lady called irritably after them
	don't apologize for bothering me  i'll just hang here, wide open, until you get back, shall iyeah, thanks ron shouted over his shoulder
	hermione, where are we going  harry asked, after she had ledthem down through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the entrance hall
	you'll see, you'll see in a minute  said hermione excitedly
	she turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door through which cedric diggory had gone the night after the goblet of fire had regurgitated his and harry's names
	harry had never been through here before
	he and ron followed hermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to snape's dungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with torches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that were mainly of food
	said harry slowly, halfway down the corridor
	wait a minute, hermione
	what she turned around to look at him, anticipation all over her face
	i know what this is about, said harry
	he nudged ron and pointed to the painting just behind hermione
	it showed a gigantic silver fruit bowl
	hermione said ron, cottoning on
	you're trying to rope us into that spew stuff againno, no, i'm not she said hastily
	and it's not spew, ron changed the name, have you  said ron, frowning at her
	what are we now, then, the houseelf liberation front  i'm not barging into that kitchen and trying to make them stop work, i'm not doing it i'm not asking you to  hermione said impatiently
	i came down here just now, to talk to them all, and i found  oh come on, harry, i want to show youshe seized his arm again, pulled him in front of the picture of the giant fruit bowl, stretched out her forefinger, and tickled the huge green pear
	it began to squirm, chuckling, and suddenly turned into a large green door handle
	hermione seized it, pulled the door open, and pushed harry hard in the back, forcing him inside
	he had one brief glimpse of an enormous, highceilinged room, large as the great hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room, squealing, harry potter, sir  harry potternext second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break
	it is dobby, sir, it is  squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel
	dobby has been hoping and hoping to see harry potter, sir, and harry potter has come to see him, sirdobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at harry, his enormous, green, tennisballshaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness
	he looked almost exactly as harry remembered him the pencilshaped nose, the batlike ears, the long fingers and feet  all except the clothes, which were very different
	when dobby had worked for the malfoys, he had always worn the same filthy old pillowcase
	now, however, he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments harry had ever seen he had done an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the world cup
	he was wearing a tea cozy for a hat, on which he had pinned a number of bright badges a tie patterned with horseshoes over a bare chest, a pair of what looked like children's soccer shorts, and odd socks
	one of these, harry saw, was the black one harry had removed from his own foot and tricked mr
	malfoy into giving dobby, thereby setting dobby free
	the other was covered in pink and orange stripes
	dobby, what're you doing here harry said in amazement
	dobby has come to work at hogwarts, sir dobby squealed excitedly
	professor dumbledore gave dobby and winky jobs, sirwinky  said harry
	she's here tooyes, sir, yes  said dobby, and he seized harry's hand and pulled him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there
	each of these tables, harry noticed as he passed them, was positioned exactly beneath the four house tables above, in the great hall
	at the moment, they were clear of food, dinner having finished, but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts above
	at least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen, beaming, bowing, and curtsying as dobby led harry past them
	they were all wearing the same uniform a tea towel stamped with the hogwarts crest, and tied, as winky's had been, like a toga
	dobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointed
	winky was sitting on a stool by the fire
	unlike dobby, she had obviously not foraged for clothes
	she was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a matching blue hat, which had holes in it for her large ears
	however, while every one of dobby's strange collection of garments was so clean and well cared for that it looked brandnew, winky was plainly not taking care other clothes at all
	there were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt
	hello, winky, said harry
	then she burst into tears, which spilled out of her great brown eyes and splashed down her front, just as they had done at the quidditch world cup
	oh dear, said hermione
	she and ron had followed harry and dobby to the end of the kitchen
	winky, don't cry, please don't
	but winky cried harder than ever
	dobby, on the other hand, beamed up at harry
	would harry potter like a cup of tea he squeaked loudly, over winky's sobs
	er  yeah, okay, said harry
	instantly, about six houseelves came trotting up behind him, bearing a large silver tray laden with a teapot, cups for harry, ron, and hermione, a milk jug, and a large plate of biscuits
	good service  ron said, in an impressed voice
	hermione frowned at him, but the elves all looked delighted they bowed very low and retreated
	how long have you been here, dobby  harry asked as dobby handed around the tea
	harry potter, sir  said dobby happily
	dobby came to see professor dumbledore, sir
	you see, sir, it is very difficult for a houseelf who has been dismissed to get a new position, sir, very difficult indeed at this, winky howled even harder, her squashedtomato of a nose dribbling all down her front, though she made no effort to stem the flow
	dobby has traveled the country for two whole years, sir, trying to find work  dobby squeaked
	but dobby hasn't found work, sir, because dobby wants paying nowthe houseelves all around the kitchen, who had been listening and watching with interest, all looked away at these words, as though dobby had said something rude and embarrassing
	hermione, however, said, good for you, dobbythank you, miss  said dobby, grinning toothily at her
	but most wizards doesn't want a houseelf who wants paying, miss
	'that's not the point of a houseelf,' they says, and they slammed the door in dobby's face  dobby likes work, but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid
	dobby likes being freethe hogwarts houseelves had now started edging away from dobby, as though he were carrying something contagious
	winky, however, remained where she was, though there was a definite increase in the volume other crying
	and then, harry potter, dobby goes to visit winky, and finds out winky has been freed too, sir  said dobby delightedly
	at this, winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay facedown on the flagged stone floor, beating her tiny fists upon it and positively screaming with misery
	hermione hastily dropped down to her knees beside her and tried to comfort her, but nothing she said made the slightest difference
	dobby continued with his story, shouting shrilly over winky's screeches
	and then dobby had the idea
	harry potter, sir 'why doesn't dobby and winky find work together'  dobby says
	'where is there enough work for two houseelves' says winky
	and dobby thinks, and it comes to him, sir  hogwarts  so dobby and winky came to see professor dumbledore, sir, and professor dumbledore took us ondobby beamed very brightly, and happy tears welled in his eyes again
	and professor dumbledore says he will pay dobby, sir, if dobby wants paying  and so dobby is a free elf, sir, and dobby gets a galleon a week and one day off a monththat's not very much hermione shouted indignantly from the floor, over winky's continued screaming and fistbeating
	professor dumbledore offered dobby ten galleons a week, and weekends off, said dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as though the prospect of so much leisure and riches were frightening, but dobby beat him down, miss
	dobby likes freedom, miss, but he isn't wanting too much, miss, he likes work better
	and how much is professor dumbledore paying you, winky hermione asked kindly
	if she had thought this would cheer up winky, she was wildly mistaken
	winky did stop crying, but when she sat up she was glaring at hermione through her massive brown eyes, her whole face sopping wet and suddenly furious
	winky is a disgraced elf, but winky is not yet getting paid she squeaked
	winky is not sunk so low as that  winky is properly ashamed of being freedashamed  said hermione blankly
	but  winky, come on  it's mr
	crouch who should be ashamed, not you  you didn't do anything wrong, he was really horrible to you but at these words, winky clapped her hands over the holes in her hat, flattening her ears so that she couldn't hear a word, and screeched, you is not insulting my master, miss you is not insulting mr
	crouch is a good wizard, miss  mr
	crouch is right to sack bad winkywinky is having trouble adjusting, harry potter, squeaked dobby confidentially
	winky forgets she is not bound to mr
	crouch anymore she is allowed to speak her mind now, but she won't do it
	can't houseelves speak their minds about their masters, then harry asked
	oh no, sir, no, said dobby, looking suddenly serious
	'tis part of the houseelf's enslavement, sir
	we keeps their secrets and our silence, sir
	we upholds the family's honor, and we never speaks ill of them  though professor dumbledore told dobby he does not insist upon this
	professor dumbledore said we is free to  todobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned harry closer
	dobby whispered, he said we is free to call him a  a barmy old codger if we likes, sirdobby gave a frightened sort of giggle
	but dobby is not wanting to, harry potter, he said, talking normally again, and shaking his head so that his ears flapped
	dobby likes professor dumbledore very much, sir, and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him
	but you can say what you like about the malfoys now harry asked him, grinning
	a slightly fearful look came into dobby's immense eyes
	dobby  dobby could, he said doubtfully
	he squared his small shoulders
	dobby could tell harry potter that his old masters were  were  bad dark wizards'
	dobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horrorstruck by his own daring  then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very hard, squealing, bad dobby bad dobbyharry seized dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away from the table
	harry potter, thank you, said dobby breathlessly, rubbing his head
	you just need a bit of practice, harry said
	practice  squealed winky furiously
	you is ought to be ashamed of yourself, dobby, talking that way about your mastersthey isn't my masters anymore, winky  said dobby defiantly
	dobby doesn't care what they think anymoreoh you is a bad elf, dobby  moaned winky, tears leaking down her face once more
	crouch, what is he doing without winky  he is needing me, he is needing my help  i is looking after the crouches all my life, and my mother is doing it before me, and my grandmother is doing it before her
	oh what is they saying if they knew winky was freed  oh the shame, the shame  she buried her face in her skirt again and bawled
	winky, said hermione firmly, i'm quite sure mr
	crouch is getting along perfectly well without you
	we've seen him, you know you is seeing my master  said winky breathlessly, raising her tearstained face out of her skirt once more and goggling at hermione
	you is seeing him here at hogwartsyes, said hermione, he and mr
	bagman are judges in the triwizard tournament
	bagman comes too squeaked winky, and to harry 's great surprise and ron's and hermione's too, by the looks on their faces, she looked angry again
	bagman is a bad wizard  a very bad wizard  my master isn't liking him, oh no, not at allbagman  bad  said harry
	oh yes, winky said, nodding her head furiously, my master is telling winky some things  but winky is not saying
	winky  winky keeps her master's secrets
	she dissolved yet again in tears they could hear her sobbing into her skirt, poor master, poor master, no winky to help him no morethey couldn't get another sensible word out of winky
	they left her to her crying and finished their tea, while dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf and his plans for his wages
	dobby is going to buy a sweater next, harry potter he said happily, pointing at his bare chest,tell you what, dobby, said ron, who seemed to have taken a great liking to the elf, i'll give you the one my mum knits me this christmas, i always get one from her
	you don't mind maroon, do youdobby was delighted
	we might have to shrink it a bit to fit you, ron told him, but it'll go well with your tea cozy
	as they prepared to take their leave, many of the surrounding elves pressed in upon them, offering snacks to take back upstairs
	hermione refused, with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying, but harry and ron loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies
	thanks a lot harry said to the elves, who had all clustered around the door to say good night
	see you, dobbyharry potter
	can dobby come and see you sometimes, sir  dobby asked tentatively
	'course you can, said harry, and dobby beamed
	you know what  said ron, once he, hermione, and harry had left the kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again
	all these years i've been really impressed with fred and george, nicking food from the kitchens  well, it's not exactly difficult, is it  they can't wait to give it awayi think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves, you know, said hermione, leading the way back up the marble staircase
	dobby coming to work here, i mean
	the other elves will see how happy he is, being free, and slowly it'll dawn on them that they want that toolet's hope they don't look too closely at winky, said harry
	oh she'll cheer up, said hermione, though she sounded a bit doubtful
	once the shock's worn off, and she's got used to hogwarts, she'll see how much better off she is without that crouch man
	she seems to love him, said ron thickly he had just started on a cream cake
	doesn't think much of bagman, though, does she  said harry
	wonder what crouch says at home about himprobably says he's not a very good head of department, said hermione, and let's face it
	he's got a point, hasn't hei'd still rather work for him than old crouch, said ron
	at least bagman's got a sense of humor
	don't let percy hear you saying that, hermione said, smiling slightly
	yeah, well, percy wouldn't want to work for anyone with a sense of humor, would he said ron, now starting on a chocolate eclair
	percy wouldn't recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing dobby's tea cozy
	chapter twentytwo  the unexpected taskpotter  weasley  will you pay attentionprofessor mcgonagall's irritated voice cracked like a whip through the transfiguration class on thursday, and harry and ron both jumped and looked up
	it was the end of the lesson they had finished their work the guinea fowl they had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on professor mcgonagall's desk neville's still had feathers they had copied down their homework from the blackboard describe, with examples, the ways in which transforming spells must be adapted when performing crossspecies switches
	the bell was due to ring at any moment, and harry and ron, who had been having a sword fight with a couple of fred and george's fake wands at the back of the class, looked up, ron holding a tin parrot and harry, a rubber haddock
	now that potter and weasley have been kind enough to act their age, said professor mcgonagall, with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of harry's haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor  ron's parrot's beak had severed it moments before  i have something to say to you all
	the yule ball is approaching  a traditional part of the triwizard tournament and an opportunity for us to socialize with our foreign guests
	now, the ball will be open only to fourth years and above  although you may invite a younger student if you wish lavender brown let out a shrill giggle
	parvati patil nudged her hard in the ribs, her face working furiously as she too fought not to giggle
	they both looked around at harry, professor mcgonagall ignored them, which harry thought was distinctly unfair, as she had just told off him and ron
	dress robes will be worn, professor mcgonagall continued, and the ball will start at eight o'clock on christmas day, finishing at midnight in the great hall
	now then professor mcgonagall stared deliberately around the class
	the yule ball is of course a chance for us all to  er  let our hair down, she said, in a disapproving voice
	lavender giggled harder than ever, with her hand pressed hard against her mouth to stifle the sound
	harry could see what was funny this time  professor mcgonagall, with her hair in a tight bun, looked as though she had never let her hair down in any sense
	but that does not mean, professor mcgonagall went on, that we will be relaxing the standards of behavior we expect from hogwarts students
	i will be most seriously displeased if a gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any way
	the bell rang, and there was the usual scuffle of activity as everyone packed their bags and swung them onto their shoulders
	professor mcgonagall called above the noise, potter  a word, if you please
	assuming this had something to do with his headless rubber haddock, harry proceeded gloomily to the teacher's desk
	professor mcgonagall waited until the rest of the class had gone, and then said, potter, the champions and their partners what partners said harry
	profesor mcgonagall looked suspiciously at him, as though she thought he was trying to be funny
	your partners for the yule ball, potter, she said coldly
	harry's insides seemed to curl up and shrivel
	dance partners  he felt himself going red
	i don't dance, he said quickly
	oh yes, you do, said professor mcgonagall irritably
	that's what i'm telling you
	traditionally, the champions and their partners open the ball
	harry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and tails, accompanied by a girl in the sort of frilly dress aunt petunia always wore to uncle vernon's work parties
	i'm not dancing, he said
	it is traditional, said professor mcgonagall firmly
	you are a hogwarts champion, and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the school
	so make sure you get yourself a partner, potter
	buti don'tyou heard me, potter, said professor mcgonagall in a very final sort of way
	harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a cinch compared to taking on a hungarian horntail
	but now that he had done the latter, and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball, he thought he'd rather have another round with the dragon
	harry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at hogwarts for christmas he always did, of course, because the alternative was usually going back to privet drive, but he had always been very much in the minority before now
	this year, however, everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying, and they all seemed to harry to be obsessed with the coming ball  or at least all the girls were, and it was amazing how many girls hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold he had never quite noticed that before
	girls giggling and whispering in the corridors, girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them, girls excitedly comparing notes on what they were going to wear on christmas night
	why do they have to move in packs  harry asked ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them, sniggering and staring at harry
	how're you supposed to get one on their own to ask themlasso one  ron suggested
	got any idea who you're going to tryharry didn't answer
	he knew perfectly well whom he'd like to ask, but working up the nerve was something else
	cho was a year older than he was she was very pretty she was a very good quidditch player, and she was also very popular
	ron seemed to know what was going on inside harry's head
	listen, you're not going to have any trouble
	you've just beaten a hungarian horntail
	i bet they'll be queuing up to go with you
	in tribute to their recently repaired friendship, ron had kept the bitterness in his voice to a bare minimum
	moreover, to harry's amazement, he turned out to be quite right
	a curlyhaired thirdyear hufflepuff girl to whom harry had never spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day
	harry was so taken aback he said no before he'd even stopped to consider the matter
	the girl walked off looking rather hurt, and harry had to endure dean's, seamus's, and ron's taunts about her all through history of magic
	the following day, two more girls asked him, a second year and to his horror a fifth year who looked as though she might knock him out if he refused
	she was quite goodlooking, said ron fairly, after he'd stopped laughing
	she was a foot taller than me, said harry, still unnerved
	imagine what i'd look like trying to dance with her
	hermione's words about krum kept coming back to him
	they only like him because he's famous  harry doubted very much if any of the girls who had asked to be his partner so far would have wanted to go to the ball with him if he hadn't been a school champion
	then he wondered if this would bother him if cho asked him
	harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him, life had definitely improved since he had got through the first task
	he wasn't attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors anymore, which he suspected had a lot to do with cedric  he had an idea cedric might have told the hufflepuffs to leave harry alone, in gratitude for harry's tipoff about the dragons
	there seemed to be fewer support cedric diggory badges around too
	draco malfoy, of course, was still quoting rita skeeter's article to him at every possible opportunity, but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it  and just to heighten harry's feeling of wellbeing, no story about hagrid had appeared in the daily prophet
	she didn' seem very int'rested in magical creatures, ter tell yeh the truth, hagrid said, when harry, ron, and hermione asked him how his interview with rita skeeter had gone during the last care of magical creatures lesson of the term
	to their very great relief, hagrid had given up on direct contact with the skrewts now, and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today, sitting at a trestle table and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to tempt the skrewts
	she jus' wanted me ter talk about you, harry, hagrid continued in a low voice
	well, i told her we'd been friends since i went ter fetch yeh from the dursleys
	'never had to tell him off in four years'  she said
	'never played you up in lessons, has he'  i told her no, an she didn' seem happy at all
	yeh'd think she wanted me to say yeh were horrible, harry
	'course she did, said harry, throwing lumps of dragon liver into a large metal bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more
	she can't keep writing about what a tragic little hero i am, it'll get boring
	she wants a new angle, hagrid, said ron wisely as he shelled salamander eggs
	you were supposed to say harry's a mad delinquentbut he's not said hagrid, looking genuinely shocked
	she should've interviewed snape, said harry grimly
	he'd give her the goods on me any day
	'potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school
	'said that, did he  said hagrid, while ron and hermione laughed
	well, yeh might've bent a few rules
	harry, bu' yeh're all righ' really, aren' youcheers, hagrid, said harry, grinning
	you coming to this ball thing on christmas day, hagrid  said ron
	though' i might look in on it, yeah, said hagrid gruffly
	should be a good do, i reckon
	you'll be openin the dancin', won yeh, harry  who're you takin'no one, yet, said harry, feeling himself going red again
	hagrid didn't pursue the subject
	the last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed
	rumors about the yule ball were flying everywhere, though harry didn't believe half of them  for instance, that dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from madam rosmerta
	it seemed to be fact, however, that he had booked the weird sisters
	exactly who or what the weird sisters were harry didn't know, never having had access to a wizard's wireless, but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the wwn wizarding wireless network that they were a very famous musical group
	some of the teachers, like little professor flitwick, gave up trying to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere he allowed them to play games in his lesson on wednesday, and spent most of it talking to harry about the perfect summoning charmharry had used during the first task of the triwizard tournament
	other teachers were not so generous
	nothing would ever deflect professor binns, for example, from plowing on through his notes on goblin rebellions  as binns hadn't let his own death stand in the way of continuing to teach, they supposed a small thing like christmas wasn't going to put him off
	it was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as percys cauldronbottom report
	professors mcgonagall and moody kept them working until the very last second of their classes too, and snape, of course, would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt harry
	staring nastily around at them all, he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of the term
	evil, he is, ron said bitterly that night in the gryffindor common room
	springing a test on us on the last day
	ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of studying
	you're not exactly straining yourself, though, are you  said hermione, looking at him over the top of her potions notes
	ron was busy building a card castle out of his exploding snap pack  a much more interesting pastime than with muggle cards, because of the chance that the whole thing would blow up at any second
	it's christmas, hermione, said harry lazily he was rereading flying with the cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire
	hermione looked severely over at him too
	i'd have thought you'd be doing something constructive, harry, even if you don't want to learn your antidoteslike what harry said as he watched joey jenkins of the cannons belt a bludger toward a ballycastle bats chaser
	that egg hermione hissed
	come on, hermione, i've got till february the twentyfourth, harry said
	he had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk and hadn't opened it since the celebration party after the first task
	there were still two and a half months to go until he needed to know what all the screechy wailing meant, after all
	but it might take weeks to work it out said hermione
	you're going to look a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you don'tleave him alone, hermione, he's earned a bit of a break, said ron, and he placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up, singeing his eyebrows
	go well with your dress robes, that will
	it was fred and george
	they sat down at the table with harry, ron, and hermione as ron felt how much damage had been done
	ron, can we borrow pigwidgeon  george asked
	no, he's off delivering a letter, said ron
	whybecause george wants to invite him to the ball, said fred sarcastically
	because we want to send a letter, you stupid great prat, said george
	who d'you two keep writing to, eh  said ron
	nose out, ron, or i'll burn that for you too, said fred, waving his wand threateningly
	you lot got dates for the ball yetnope, said ron
	well, you'd better hurry up, mate, or all the good ones will be gone, said fred
	who're you going with, then said ron
	angelina, said fred promptly, without a trace of embarrassment
	what said ron, taken aback
	you've already asked hergood point, said fred
	he turned his head and called across the common room, oi angelinaangelina, who had been chatting with alicia spinnet near the fire, looked over at him
	want to come to the ball with meangelina gave fred an appraising sort of look
	all right, then, she said, and she turned back to alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her face
	there you go, said fred to harry and ron, piece of cake
	he got to his feet, yawning, and said, we'd better use a school owl then, george, come on
	ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle at harry
	we should get a move on, you know
	we don't want to end up with a pair of trolls
	hermione let out a sputter of indignation
	what, excuse mewell  you know, said ron, shrugging
	i'd rather go alone than with  with eloise midgen, say
	her acne's loads better lately  and she's really niceher nose is offcenter, said ron
	oh i see, hermione said, bristling
	so basically, you're going to take the bestlooking girl who'll have you, even if she's completely horribleer  yeah, that sounds about right, said ron
	i'm going to bed,   hermione snapped, and she swept off toward the girls' staircase without another word
	the hogwarts staff, demonstrating a continued desire to impress the visitors from beauxbatons and durmstrang, seemed determined to show the castle at its best this christmas
	when the decorations went up
	harry noticed that they were the most stunning he had yet seen inside the school
	everlasting icicles had been attached to the banisters of the marble staircase the usual twelve christmas trees in the great hall were bedecked with everything from luminous holly berries to real, hooting, golden owls, and the suits of armor had all been bewitched to sing carols whenever anyone passed them
	it was quite something to hear 0 come, all ye faithful sung by an empty helmet that only knew half the words
	several times, filch the caretaker had to extract peeves from inside the armor, where he had taken to hiding, filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of his own invention, all of which were very rude
	harry hadn't asked cho to the ball
	he and ron were getting very nervous now, though as harry pointed out, ron would look much less stupid than he would without a partnerharry was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other champions
	i suppose there's always moaning myrtle, he said gloomily, referring to the ghost who haunted the girls' toilets on the second floor
	harry  we've just got to grit our teeth and do it, said ron on friday morning, in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable fortress
	when we get back to the common room tonight, we'll both have partners  agreeder
	but every time he glimpsed cho that day  during break, and then lunchtime, and once on the way to history of magic  she was surrounded by friends
	didn't she ever go anywhere alone  could he perhaps ambush her as she was going into a bathroom  but no  she even seemed to go there with an escort of four or five girls
	yet if he didn't do it soon, she was bound to have been asked by somebody else
	he found it hard to concentrate on snape's potions test, and consequently forgot to add the key ingredient  a bezoar  meaning that he received bottom marks
	he didn't care, though he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do
	when the bell rang, he grabbed his bag, and hurried to the dungeon door
	i'll meet you at dinner, he said to ron and hermione, and he dashed off upstairs
	he'd just have to ask cho for a private word, that was all
	he hurried off through the packed corridors looking for her, and rather sooner than he had expected he found her, emerging from a defense against the dark arts lesson
	er  cho could i have a word with yougiggling should be made illegal
	harry thought furiously, as all the girls around cho started doing it
	she said, okay, and followed him out of earshot other classmates
	harry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs
	cho stood there looking puzzled, watching him
	the words came out before harry had quite got his tongue around them
	wangoballwimesorry  said cho
	d'you  d'you want to go to the ball with me  said harry
	why did he have to go red now whyoh s aid cho, and she went red too
	oh harry, i'm really sorry, and she truly looked it
	i've already said i'll go with someone else
	it was odd a moment before his insides had been writhing like snakes, but suddenly he didn't seem to have any insides at all
	oh okay, he said, no problem
	i'm really sorry, she said again
	that's okay, said harry
	they stood there looking at each other, and then cho said, wellyeah, said harry
	well, 'bye, said cho, still very red
	harry called after her, before he could stop himself
	who're you going withoh  cedric, she said
	his insides had come back again
	it felt as though they had been filled with lead in their absence
	completely forgetting about dinner, he walked slowly back up to gryffindor tower, cho's voice echoing in his ears with every step he took
	cedric  cedric diggory
	he had been starting to quite like cedric  prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at quidditch, and was handsome, and popular, and nearly everyone's favorite champion
	now he suddenly realized that cedric was in fact a useless pretty boy who didn't have enough brains to fill an eggcup
	fairy lights, he said dully to the fat lady  the password had been changed the previous day
	yes, indeed, dear  she trilled, straightening her new tinsel hair band as she swung forward to admit him
	entering the common room, harry looked around, and to his surprise he saw ron sitting ashenfaced in a distant corner
	ginny was sitting with him, talking to him in what seemed to be a low, soothing voice
	what's up, ron said harry, joining them
	ron looked up at harry, a sort of blind horror in his face
	why did i do it he said wildly
	i don't know what made me do itwhat said harry
	he  er  just asked fleur delacour to go to the ball with him, said ginny
	she looked as though she was fighting back a smile, but she kept patting ron's arm sympathetically
	i don't know what made me do it  ron gasped again
	what was i playing at there were people  all around  i've gone mad  everyone watching  i was just walking past her in the entrance hall  she was standing there talking to diggory  and it sort of came over me  and i asked herron moaned and put his face in his hands
	he kept talking, though the words were barely distinguishable
	she looked at me like i was a sea slug or something
	and then  i dunno  i just sort of came to my senses and ran for it
	she's part veela, said harry
	you were right  her grandmother was one
	it wasn't your fault, i bet you just walked past when she was turning on the old charm for diggory and got a blast of it  but she was wasting her time
	he's going with cho chang
	i asked her to go with me just now, harry said dully, and she told me
	ginny had suddenly stopped smiling
	this is mad, said ron
	we're the only ones left who haven't got anyone  well, except neville
	hey  guess who he asked  hermionewhat said harry, completely distracted by this startling news
	yeah, i know  said ron, some of the color coming back into his face as he started to laugh
	he told me after potions  said she's always been really nice, helping him out with work and stuff but she told him she was already going with someone
	ha  as if  she just didn't want to go with neville
	i mean, who woulddon't said ginny, annoyed
	don't laugh just then hermione climbed in through the portrait hole
	why weren't you two at dinner  she said, coming over to join them
	because  oh shut up laughing, you two  because they've both just been turned down by girls they asked to the ball  said ginny
	that shut harry and ron up
	thanks a bunch, ginny, said ron sourly
	all the goodlooking ones taken, ron  said hermione loftily
	eloise midgen starting to look quite pretty now, is she  well, i'm sure you'll find someone somewhere who'll have you
	but ron was staring at hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light
	hermione, neville's right  you are a girl
	oh well spotted, she said acidly
	well  you can come with one of usno, i can't, snapped hermione
	oh come on, he said impatiently, we need partners, we're going to look really stupid if we haven't got any, everyone else has
	i can't come with you, said hermione, now blushing, because i'm already going with someone
	no, you're not  said ron
	you just said that to get rid of nevilleoh did i said hermione, and her eyes flashed dangerously
	just because it's taken you three years to notice, ron, doesn't mean no one else has spotted i'm a girlron stared at her
	then he grinned again
	okay, okay, we know you're a girl, he said
	that do  will you come nowi've already told you  hermione said very angrily
	i'm going with someone elseand she stormed off toward the girls' dormitories again
	she's lying, said ron flatly, watching her go
	she's not, said ginny quietly
	who is it then  said ron sharply
	i'm not telling you, it's her business, said ginny
	right, said ron, who looked extremely put out, this is getting stupid
	ginny, you can go with harry, and i'll just i can't, said ginny, and she went scarlet too
	i'm going with  with neville
	he asked me when hermione said no, and i thought
	i'm not going to be able to go otherwise, i'm not in fourth year
	she looked extremely miserable
	i think i'll go and have dinner, she said, and she got up and walked off to the portrait hole, her head bowed
	what's got into them  he demanded
	but harry had just seen parvati and lavender come in through the portrait hole
	the time had come for drastic action
	wait here, he said to ron, and he stood up, walked straight up to parvati, and said, parvati will you go to the ball with meparvati went into a fit of giggles
	harry waited for them to subside, his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes
	yes, all right then, she said finally, blushing furiously
	thanks, said harry, in relief
	lavender  will you go with ronshe's going with seamus, said parvati, and the pair of them giggled harder than ever
	can't you think of anyone who'd go with ron  he said, lowering his voice so that ron wouldn't hear
	what about hermione granger  said parvati
	she's going with someone else
	parvati looked astonished
	ooooh  who  she said keenly
	so what about ronwell
	said parvati slowly, i suppose my sister might
	i'll ask her if you like
	yeah, that would be great, said harry
	let me know, will youand he went back over to ron, feeling that this ball was a lot more trouble than it was worth, and hoping very much that padma patil's nose was dead center
	chapter twentythree  the yule balldespite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth  years had been given for the holidays
	harry was in no mood to work when term ended, and spent the week leading up to christmas enjoying himself as fully as possible along with everyone else
	gryffindor tower was hardly less crowded now than during termtime it seemed to have shrunk slightly too, as its inhabitants were being so much rowdier than usual
	fred and george had had a great success with their canary creams, and for the first couple of days of the holidays, people kept bursting into feather all over the place
	before long, however, all the gryffindors had learned to treat food anybody else offered them with extreme caution, in case it had a canary cream concealed in the center, and george confided to harry that he and fred were now working on developing something else
	harry made a mental note never to accept so much as a crisp from fred and george in future
	he still hadn't forgotten dudley and the tontongue toffee
	snow was falling thickly upon the castle and its grounds now
	the pale blue beauxbatons carriage looked like a large, chilly, frosted pumpkin next to the iced gingerbread house that was hagrid's cabin, while the durmstrang ship's portholes were glazed with ice, the rigging white with frost
	the houseelves down in the kitchen were outdoing themselves with a series of rich, warming stews and savory puddings, and only fleur delacour seemed to be able to find anything to complain about
	it is too 'eavy, all zis 'ogwarts food, they heard her saying grumpily as they left the great hall behind her one evening ron skulking behind harry, keen not to be spotted by fleur
	i will not fit into my dress robesoooh there's a tragedy, hermione snapped as fleur went out into the entrance hall
	she really thinks a lot of herself, that one, doesn't shehermione  who are you going to the ball with said ron
	he kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it
	however, hermione merely frowned and said, i'm not telling you, you'll just make fun of me
	you're joking, weasley said malfoy, behind them
	you're not telling me someone's asked that to the ball  not the longmolared mudblood                                                harry and ron both whipped around, but hermione said loudly, waving to somebody over malfoys shoulder, hello, professor moodymalfoy went pale and jumped backward, looking wildly around for moody, but he was still up at the staff table, finishing his stew
	twitchy little ferret, aren't you, malfoy said hermione scathingly, and she, harry, and ron went up the marble staircase laughing heartily
	hermione, said ron, looking sideways at her, suddenly frowning, your teeth
	what about them she said
	well, they're different
	of course they are  did you expect me to keep those fangs malfoy gave meno, i mean, they're different to how they were before he put that hex on you
	straight and  and normalsized
	hermione suddenly smiled very mischievously, and harry noticed it too it was a very different smile from the one he remembered
	when i went up to madam pomfrey to get them shrunk, she held up a mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they normally were, she said
	let her carry on a bit
	she smiled even more widely
	mum and dad won't be too pleased
	i've been trying to persuade them to let me shrink them for ages, but they wanted me to carry on with my braces
	you know, they're dentists, they just don't think teeth and magic should  look  pigwidgeons backron's tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the icicleladen banisters, a scroll of parchment tied to his leg
	people passing him were pointing and laughing, and a group of thirdyear girls paused and said, oh look at the weeny owl  isn't he cutestupid little feathery git  ron hissed, hurrying up the stairs and snatching up pigwidgeon
	you bring letters to the addressee  you don't hang around showing offpigwidgeon hooted happily, his head protruding over ron's fist
	the thirdyear girls all looked very shocked
	clear off  ron snapped at them, waving the fist holding pigwidgeon, who hooted more happily than ever as he soared through the air
	here  take it, harry, ron added in an undertone as the thirdyear girls scuttled away looking scandalized
	he pulled sirius's reply off pigwidgeons leg
	harry pocketed it, and they hurried back to gryffindor tower to read it
	everyone in the common room was much too busy in letting off more holiday steam to observe what anyone else was up to
	ron, harry, and hermione sat apart from everyone else by a dark window that was gradually filling up with snow, and harry read outdear harry,congratulations on getting past the horntail
	whoever put your name in that goblet shouldn't be feeling too happy right now  i was going to suggest a conjunctivitus curse, as a dragon's eyes are its weakest point  that's what krum did hermione whispered  but your way was better, i'm impressed
	don't get complacent, though
	you've only done one task whoever put you in for the tournament's got plenty more opportunity if they're trying to hurt you
	keep your eyes open particularly when the person we discussed is around and concentrate on keeping yourself out of trouble
	keep in touch, i still want to hear about anything unusual
	siriushe sounds exactly like moody, said harry quietly, tucking the letter away again inside his robes
	'constant vigilance'  you'd think i walk around with my eyes shut, banging off the walls
	but he's right, harry, said hermione, you have still got two tasks to do
	you really ought to have a look at that egg, you know, and start working out what it means
	hermione, he's got ages  snapped ron
	want a game of chess, harryyeah, okay, said harry
	then, spotting the look on hermione's face, he said, come on, how'm i supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on  i won't even be able to hear the egg over this lot
	oh i suppose not, she sighed, and she sat down to watch their chess match, which culminated in an exciting checkmate of ron's, involving a couple of recklessly brave pawns and a very violent bishop
	harry awoke very suddenly on christmas day
	wondering what had caused his abrupt return to consciousness, he opened his eyes, and saw something with very large, round, green eyes staring back at him in the darkness, so close they were almost nose to nose
	dobby  harry yelled, scrambling away from the elf so fast he almost fell out of bed
	don't do thatdobby is sorry, sir  squeaked dobby anxiously, jumping backward with his long fingers over his mouth
	dobby is only wanting to wish harry potter 'merry christmas' and bring him a present, sir  harry potter did say dobby could come and see him sometimes, sirit's okay, said harry, still breathing rather faster than usual, while his heart rate returned to normal
	just  just prod me or something in future, all right, don't bend over me like that
	harry pulled back the curtains around his fourposter, took his glasses from his bedside table, and put them on
	his yell had awoken ron, seamus, dean, and neville
	all of them were peering through the gaps in their own hangings, heavyeyed and touslehaired
	someone attacking you, harry seamus asked sleepily
	no, it's just dobby, harry muttered
	presents said seamus, spotting the large pile at the foot of his bed
	ron, dean, and neville decided that now they were awake they might as well get down to some presentopening too
	harry turned back to dobby, who was now standing nervously next to harrys bed, still looking worried that he had upset harry
	there was a christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his tea cozy
	can dobby give harry potter his present  he squeaked tentatively
	'course you can, said harry
	i've got something for you too
	it was a lie he hadn't bought anything for dobby at all, but he quickly opened his trunk and pulled out a particularly knobbly rolledup pair of socks
	they were his oldest and foulest, mustard yellow, and had once belonged to uncle vernon
	the reason they were extraknobbly was that harry had been using them to cushion his sneakoscope for over a year now
	he pulled out the sneakoscope and handed the socks to dobby, saying, sorry, i forgot to wrap them
	but dobby was utterly delighted
	socks are dobby's favorite, favorite clothes, sir  he said, ripping off his odd ones and pulling on uncle vernon's
	i has seven now, sir
	he said, his eyes widening, having pulled both socks up to their highest extent, so that they reached to the bottom of his shorts, they has made a mistake in the shop, harry potter, they is giving you two the sameah, no, harry, how come you didn't spot that said ron, grinning over from his own bed, which was now strewn with wrapping paper
	tell you what, dobby  here you go  take these two, and you can mix them up properly
	and here's your sweater
	he threw dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped, and the handknitted sweater mrs
	weasley had sent, dobby looked quite overwhelmed
	sir is very kind  he squeaked, his eyes brimming with tears again, bowing deeply to ron
	dobby knew sir must be a great wizard, for he is harry potter's greatest friend, but dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless they're only socks, said ron, who had gone slightly pink around the ears, though he looked rather pleased all the same
	wow, harry  he had just opened harry's present, a chudley cannon hat
	cool  he jammed it onto his head, where it clashed horribly with his hair
	dobby now handed harry a small package, which turned out to be  socks
	dobby is making them himself, sir the elf said happily
	he is buying the wool out of his wages, sirthe left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it the right sock was green with a pattern of snitches
	well, thanks, dobby, said harry, and he pulled them on, causing dobby's eyes to leak with happiness again
	dobby must go now, sir, we is already making christmas dinner in the kitchens  said dobby, and he hurried out of the dormitory, waving goodbye to ron and the others as he passed
	harry's other presents were much more satisfactory than dobby's odd socks  with the obvious exception of the dursleys', which consisted of a single tissue, an alltime low  harry supposed they too were remember ing the tontongue toffee
	hermione had given harry a book called quidditch teams of britain and ireland ron, a bulging bag of dungbombs sirius, a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot and hagrid, a vast box of sweets including all harrys favorites  bertie bott's every flavor beans, chocolate frogs, drooble's best blowing gum, and fizzing whizbees
	there was also, of course, mrs
	weasley's usual package, including a new sweater green, with a picture of a dragon on it  harry supposed charlie had told her all about the horntail, and a large quantity of homemade mince pies
	harry and ron met up with hermione in the common room, and they went down to breakfast together
	they spent most of the morning in gryffindor tower, where everyone was enjoying their presents, then returned to the great hall for a magnificent lunch, which included at least a hundred turkeys and christmas puddings, and large piles of cribbage's wizarding crackers
	they went out onto the grounds in the afternoon the snow was untouched except for the deep channels made by the durmstrang and beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle
	hermione chose to watch harry and the weasleys' snowball fight rather than join in, and at five o'clock said she was going back upstairs to get ready for the ball
	what, you need three hours  said ron, looking at her incredulously and paying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball, thrown by george, hit him hard on the side of the head
	who're you going with  he yelled after hermione, but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle
	there was no christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so at seven o'clock, when it had become hard to aim properly, the others abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room
	the fat lady was sitting in her frame with her friend violet from downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom other picture
	lairy fights, that's the one  she giggled when they gave the password, and she swung forward to let them inside
	harry, ron, seamus, dean, and neville changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory, all of them looking very selfconscious, but none as much as ron, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face
	there was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else
	in a desperate attempt to make them look more manly, he used a severing charm on the ruff and cuffs
	it worked fairly well at least he was now lacefree, although he hadn't done a very neat job, and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs
	i still can't work out how you two got the bestlooking girls in the year, muttered dean
	animal magnetism, said ron gloomily, pulling stray threads out of his cuffs
	the common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of black
	parvati was waiting for harry at the foot of the stairs
	she looked very pretty indeed, in robes of shocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists
	harry was relieved to see that she wasn't giggling
	you  er  look nice, he said awkwardly
	padma's going to meet you in the entrance hall, she added to ron
	right, said ron, looking around
	where's hermioneparvati shrugged
	shall we go down then, harryokay, said harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room
	fred winked at harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole
	the entrance hall was packed with students too, all milling around waiting for eight o'clock, when the doors to the great hall would be thrown open
	those people who were meeting partners from different houses were edging through the crowd trying to find one another
	parvati found her sister, padma, and led her over to harry and ron
	hi, said padma, who was looking just as pretty as parvati in robes of bright turquoise
	she didn't look too enthusiastic about having ron as a partner, though her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and sleeves of his dress robes as she looked him up and down
	hi, said ron, not looking at her, but staring around at the crowd
	he bent his knees slightly to hide behind harry, because fleur delacour was passing, looking stunning in robes of silvergray satin, and accompanied by the ravenclaw quidditch captain, roger davies
	when they had disappeared, ron stood straight again and stared over the heads of the crowd
	where is hermione he said again
	a group of slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common room
	malfoy was in front he was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar, which in harry's opinion made him look like a vicar
	pansy parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink was clutching malfoy's arm
	crabbe and goyle were both wearing green they resembled mosscolored boulders, and neither of them, harry was pleased to see, had managed to find a partner
	the oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to look as the durmstrang students entered with professor karkaroff
	krum was at the front of the party, accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes harry didn't know
	over their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights  meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there, and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be father christmas and his reindeer
	then professor mcgonagall's voice called, champions over here, pleaseparvati readjusted her bangles, beaming she and harry said, see you in a minute to ron and padma and walked forward, the chattering crowd parting to let them through
	professor mcgonagall, who was wearing dress robes of red tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim other hat, told them to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside they were to enter the great hall in procession when the rest of the students had sat down
	fleur delacour and roger davies stationed themselves nearest the doors davies looked so stunned by his good fortune in having fleur for a partner that he could hardly take his eyes off her
	cedric and cho were close to harry too he looked away from them so he wouldn't have to talk to them
	his eyes fell instead on the girl next to krum
	but she didn't look like hermione at all
	she had done something with her hair it was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head
	she was wearing robes made of a floaty, periwinkleblue material, and she was holding herself differently, somehow  or maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty or so books she usually had slung over her back
	she was also smiling  rather nervously, it was true  but the reduction in the size of her front teeth was more noticeable than ever harry couldn't understand how he hadn't spotted it before
	hi, parvatiparvati was gazing at hermione in unflattering disbelief
	she wasn't the only one either when the doors to the great hall opened, krum's fan club from the library stalked past, throwing hermione looks of deepest loathing
	pansy parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with malfoy, and even he didn't seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her
	ron, however, walked right past hermione without looking at her
	once everyone else was settled in the hall, professor mcgonagall told the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs and to follow her
	they did so, and everyone in the great hall applauded as they entered and started walking up toward a large round table at the top of the hall, where the judges were sitting
	the walls of the hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost, with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling
	the house tables had vanished instead, there were about a hundred smaller, lanternlit ones, each seating about a dozen people
	harry concentrated on not tripping over his feet
	parvati seemed to be enjoying herself she was beaming around at everybody, steering harry so forcefully that he felt as though he were a show dog she was putting through its paces
	he caught sight of ron and padma as he neared the top table
	ron was watching hermione pass with narrowed eyes
	padma was looking sulky
	dumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the top table, but karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like ron's as he watched krum and hermione draw nearer
	ludo bagman, tonight in robes of bright purple with large yellow stars, was clapping as enthusiastically as any of the students and madame maxime, who had changed her usual uniform of black satin for a flowing gown of lavender silk, was applauding them politely
	crouch, harry suddenly realized, was not there
	the fifth seat at the table was occupied by percy weasley
	when the champions and their partners reached the table, percy drew out the empty chair beside him, staring pointedly at harry
	harry took the hint and sat down next to percy, who was wearing brandnew, navyblue dress robes and an expression of such smugness that harry thought it ought to be fined
	i've been promoted, percy said before harry could even ask, and from his tone, he might have been announcing his election as supreme ruler of the universe
	crouch's personal assistant, and i'm here representing him
	why didn't he come harry asked
	he wasn't looking forward to being lectured on cauldron bottoms all through dinner
	crouch isn't well, not well at all
	hasn't been right since the world cup
	hardly surprising  overwork
	he's not as young as he was  though still quite brilliant, of course, the mind remains as great as it ever was
	but the world cup was a fiasco for the whole ministry, and then, mr
	crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that houseelf of his, blinky, or whatever she was called
	naturally, he dismissed her immediately afterward, but  well, as i say, he's getting on, he needs looking after, and i think he's found a definite drop in his home comforts since she left
	and then we had the tournament to arrange, and the aftermath of the cup to deal with  that revolting skeeter woman buzzing around  no, poor man, he's having a well earned, quiet christmas
	i'm just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place
	harry wanted very much to ask whether mr
	crouch had stopped calling percy weatherby yet, but resisted the temptation
	there was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates, but small menus were lying in front of each of them
	harry picked his up uncertainly and looked around  there were no waiters
	dumbledore, however, looked carefully down at his own menu, then said very clearly to his plate, pork chopsand pork chops appeared
	getting the idea, the rest of the table placed their orders with their plates too
	harry glanced up at hermione to see how she felt about this new and more complicated method of dining  surely it meant plenty of extra work for the houseelves  but for once, hermione didn't seem to be thinking about s
	she was deep in talk with viktor krum and hardly seemed to notice what she was eating
	it now occurred to harry that he had never actually heard krum speak before, but he was certainly talking now, and very enthusiastically at that
	veil, ve have a castle also, not as big as this, nor as comfortable, i am thinking, he was telling hermione
	ve have just four floors, and the fires are lit only for magical purposes
	but ve have grounds larger even than these  though in vinter, ve have very little daylight, so ve are not enjoying them
	but in summer ve are flying every day, over the lakes and the mountains now, now, viktor  said karkaroff with a laugh that didn't reach his cold eyes, don't go giving away anything else, now, or your charming friend will know exactly where to find usdumbledore smiled, his eyes twinkling
	igor, all this secrecy
	one would almost think you didn't want visitors
	well, dumbledore, said karkaroff, displaying his yellowing teeth to their fullest extent, we are all protective of our private domains, are we not  do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us  are we not right to be proud that we alone know our school's secrets, and right to protect themoh i would never dream of assuming i know all hogwarts' secrets, igor, said dumbledore amicably
	only this morning, for instance, i took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room i have never seen before, containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots
	when i went back to investigate more closely, i discovered that the room had vanished
	but i must keep an eye out for it
	possibly it is only accessible at fivethirty in the morning
	or it may only appear at the quarter moon  or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder
	harry snorted into his plate of goulash
	percy frowned, but harry could have sworn dumbledore had given him a very small wink
	meanwhile fleur delacour was criticizing the hogwarts decorations to roger davies
	zis is nothing, she said dismissively, looking around at the sparkling walls of the great hall
	at ze palace of beauxbatons, we 'ave ice sculptures all around ze dining chamber at chreestmas
	zey do not melt, of course
	zey are like 'uge statues of diamond, glittering around ze place
	and ze food is seemply superb
	and we 'ave choirs of wood nymphs, 'oo serenade us as we eat
	we 'ave none of zis ugly armor in ze 'alls, and eef a poltergeist ever entaired into beauxbatons, 'e would be expelled like zat
	she slapped her hand onto the table impatiently
	roger davies was watching her talk with a very dazed look on his face, and he kept missing his mouth with his fork
	harry had the impression that davies was too busy staring at fleur to take in a word she was saying
	absolutely right, he said quickly, slapping his own hand down on the table in imitation of fleur
	harry looked around the hall
	hagrid was sitting at one of the other staff tables he was back in his horrible hairy brown suit and gazing up at the top table
	harry saw him give a small wave, and looking around, saw madame maxime return it, her opals glittering in the candlelight
	hermione was now teaching krum to say her name properly he kept calling her hermyown
	hermyohnee, she said slowly and clearly
	close enough, she said, catching harry's eye and grinning
	when all the food had been consumed, dumbledore stood up and asked the students to do the same
	then, with a wave of his wand, all the tables zoomed back along the walls leaving the floor clear, and then he conjured a raised platform into existence along the right wall
	a set of drums, several guitars, a lute, a cello, and some bagpipes were set upon it
	the weird sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly enthusiastic applause they were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn
	they picked up their instruments, and harry, who had been so interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten what was coming, suddenly realized that the lanterns on all the other tables had gone out, and that the other champions and their partners were standing up
	come on parvati hissed
	we're supposed to danceharry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up
	the weird sisters struck up a slow, mournful tune harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor, carefully avoiding catching anyone's eye he could see seamus and dean waving at him and sniggering, and next moment, parvati had seized his hands, placed one around her waist, and was holding the other tightly in hers
	it wasn't as bad as it could have been
	harry thought, revolving slowly on the spot parvati was steering
	he kept his eyes fixed over the heads of the watching people, and very soon many of them too had come onto the dance floor, so that the champions were no longer the center of attention
	neville and ginny were dancing nearby  he could see ginny wincing frequently as neville trod on her feet  and dumbledore was waltzing with madame maxime
	he was so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat barely tickled her chin however, she moved very gracefully for a woman so large
	madeye moody was doing an extremely ungainly twostep with professor sinistra, who was nervously avoiding his wooden leg
	potter, moody growled as he passed, his magical eye staring through harry's robes
	oh  yeah, dobby the houseelf knitted them for me, said harry, grinning
	he is so creepy  parvati whispered as moody clunked away
	i don't think that eye should be allowed
	harry heard the final, quavering note from the bagpipe with relief
	the weird sisters stopped playing, applause filled the hall once more, and harry let go of parvati at once
	let's sit down, shall weoh  but  this is a really good one  parvati said as the weird sisters struck up a new song, which was much faster
	no, i don't like it, harry lied, and he led her away from the dance floor, past fred and angelina, who were dancing so exhuberantly that people around them were backing away in fear of injury, and over to the table where ron and padma were sitting
	how's it going harry asked ron, sitting down and opening a bottle of butterbeer
	he was glaring at hermione and krum, who were dancing nearby
	padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed, one foot jiggling in time to the music
	every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at ron, who was completely ignoring her
	parvati sat down on harry's other side, crossed her arms and legs too, and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy from beauxbatons
	you don't mind, do you, harry parvati said
	what said harry, who was now watching cho and cedric
	oh never mind, snapped parvati, and she went off with the boy from beauxbatons
	when the song ended, she did not return
	hermione came over and sat down in parvati's empty chair
	she was a bit pink in the face from dancing
	ron didn't say anything
	it's hot, isn't it said hermione, fanning herself with her hand
	viktors just gone to get some drinks
	ron gave her a withering look
	hasn't he asked you to call him vicky yethermione looked at him in surprise
	what's up with you she said
	if you don't know, said ron scathingly, i'm not going to tell you
	hermione stared at him, then at harry, who shrugged
	ron, what  he's from durmstrang spat ron
	he's competing against harry  against hogwarts you  you're   ron was obviously casting around for words strong enough to describe hermione's crime, fraternizing with the enemy, that's what you're doinghermione's mouth fell open
	don't be so stupid she said after a moment
	the enemy  honestly  who was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive  who was the one who wanted his autograph  who's got a model of him up in their dormitoryron chose to ignore this
	i s'pose he asked you to come with him while you were both in the libraryyes, he did, said hermione, the pink patches on her cheeks glowing more brightly
	so whatwhat happened  trying to get him to join spew, were youno, i wasn't  if you really want to know, he  he said he'd been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me, but he hadn't been able to pluck up the couragehermione said this very quickly, and blushed so deeply that she was the same color as parvati's robes
	yeah, well  that's his story, said ron nastily
	and what's that supposed to meanobvious, isn't it  he's karkaroff's student, isn't he  he knows who you hang around with
	he's just trying to get closer to harry  get inside information on him  or get near enough to jinx him hermione looked as though ron had slapped her
	when she spoke, her voice quivered
	for your information, he hasn't asked me one single thing about harry, not one ron changed tack at the speed of light
	then he's hoping you'll help him find out what his egg means i suppose you've been putting your heads together during those cozy little library sessions i'd never help him work out that egg said hermione, looking outraged
	how could you say something like that  i want harry to win the tournament
	harry knows that, don't you, harryyou've got a funny way of showing it, sneered ron
	this whole tournament's supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards and making friends with them  said hermione hotly
	no it isn't shouted ron
	it's about winningpeople were starting to stare at them
	ron, said harry quietly, i haven't got a problem with hermione coming with krum but ron ignored harry too
	why don't you go and find vicky, he'll be wondering where you are, said ron
	don't call him vickyhermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance floor, disappearing into the crowd
	ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and satisfaction on his face
	are you going to ask me to dance at all padma asked him
	no, said ron, still glaring after hermione
	fine, snapped padma, and she got up and went to join parvati and the beauxbatons boy, who conjured up one of his friends to join them so fast that harry could have sworn he had zoomed him there by a summoning charm
	vare is hermownninny said a voice
	krum had just arrived at their table clutching two butterbeers
	no idea, said ron mulishly, looking up at him
	lost her, have youkrum was looking surly again
	veil, if you see her, tell her i haff drinks, he said, and he slouched off
	made friends with viktor krum, have you, ronpercy had bustled over, rubbing his hands together and looking extremely pompous
	excellent  that's the whole point, you know  international magical cooperationto harry's displeasure, percy now took padma's vacated seat
	the top table was now empty professor dumbledore was dancing with professor sprout, ludo bagman with professor mcgonagall madame maxime and hagrid were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students, and karkaroff was nowhere to be seen
	when the next song ended, everybody applauded once more, and harry saw ludo bagman kiss professor mcgonagall's hand and make his way back through the crowds, at which point fred and george accosted him
	what do they think they're doing, annoying senior ministry members percy hissed, watching fred and george suspiciously
	ludo bagman shook off fred and george fairly quickly, however, and, spotting harry, waved and came over to their table
	i hope my brothers weren't bothering you, mr
	bagman said percy at once
	what oh not at all, not at all said bagman
	no, they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs
	wondering if i could advise them on the marketing
	i've promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at zonko's joke shop
	percy didn't look happy about this at all, and harry was prepared to bet he would be rushing to tell mrs
	weasley about this the moment he got home
	apparently fred and george's plans had grown even more ambitious lately, if they were hoping to sell to the public
	bagman opened his mouth to ask harry something, but percy diverted him
	how do you feel the tournament's going, mr
	bagman  our department's quite satisfied  the hitch with the goblet of fire  he glanced at harry  was a little unfortunate, of course, but it seems to have gone very smoothly since, don't you thinkoh yes, bagman said cheerfully, it's all been enormous fun
	how's old barty doing shame he couldn't come
	crouch will be up and about in no time, said percy importantly, but in the meantime, i'm more than willing to take up the slack
	of course, it's not all attending balls  he laughed airily  oh no, i've had to deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up in his absence  you heard ali bashir was caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets into the country  and then we've been trying to persuade the transylvanians to sign the international ban on dueling
	i've got a meeting with their head of magical cooperation in the new year let's go for a walk, ron muttered to harry, get away from percy
	pretending they wanted more drinks
	harry and ron left the table, edged around the dance floor, and slipped out into the entrance hall
	the front doors stood open, and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose garden winked and twinkled as they went down the front steps, where they found themselves surrounded by bushes winding, ornamental paths and large stone statues
	harry could hear splashing water, which sounded like a fountain
	here and there, people were sitting on carved benches
	he and ron set off along one of the winding paths through the rosebushes, but they had gone only a short way when they heard an unpleasantly familiar voice
	don't see what there is to fuss about, igor
	severus, you cannot pretend this isn't happening  karkaroffs voice sounded anxious and hushed, as though keen not to be overheard
	it's been getting clearer and clearer for months
	i am becoming seriously concerned, i can't deny it then flee, said snapes voice curtly
	flee  i will make your excuses
	i, however, am remaining at hogwarts
	snape and karkaroff came around the corner
	snape had his wand out and was blasting rosebushes apart, his expression most illnatured
	squeals issued from many of the bushes, and dark shapes emerged from them
	ten points from ravenclaw, fawcett snape snarled as a girl ran past him
	and ten points from hufflepuff too, stebbins  as a boy went rushing after her
	and what are you two doing  he added, catching sight of harry and ron on the path ahead
	karkaroff, harry saw, looked slightly discomposed to see them standing there
	his hand went nervously to his goatee, and he began winding it around his finger
	we re walking, ron told snape shortly
	not against the law, is itkeep walking, then  snape snarled, and he brushed past them, his long black cloak billowing out behind him
	karkaroff hurried away after snape
	harry and ron continued down the path
	what's got karkaroff all worried  ron muttered
	and since when have he and snape been on firstname termssaid harry slowly
	they had reached a large stone reindeer now, over which they could see the sparkling jets of a tall fountain
	the shadowy outlines of two enormous people were visible on a stone bench, watching the water in the moonlight
	and then harry heard hagrid speak
	momen' i saw yeh, i knew, he was saying, in an oddly husky voice
	this didn't sound like the sort of scene they ought to walk in on, somehow
	harry looked around, back up the path, and saw fleur delacour and roger davies standing halfconcealed in a rosebush nearby
	he tapped ron on the shoulder and jerked his head toward them, meaning that they could easily sneak off that way without being noticed fleur and davies looked very busy to harry, but ron, eyes widening in horror at the sight of fleur, shook his head vigorously, and pulled harry deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer
	what did you know, 'agrid said madame maxime, a purr in her low voice
	harry definitely didn't want to listen to this he knew hagrid would hate to be overheard in a situation like this he certainly would have  if it had been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly, but that wasn't really an option
	instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle crawling along the stone reindeer's back, but the beetle just wasn't interesting enough to block out hagrid's next words
	knew you were like me
	was it yer mother or yer fatheri  i don't know what you mean, 'agrid
	it was my mother, said hagrid quietly
	she was one o' the las' ones in britain
	'course, i can' remember her too well
	when i was abou' three
	she wasn' really the maternal sort
	it's not in their natures, is it  dunno what happened to her
	might be dead fer all i know
	madame maxime didn't say anything
	and harry, in spite of himself, took his eyes off the beetle and looked over the top of the reindeer's antlers, listening
	he had never heard hagrid talk about his childhood before
	me dad was brokenhearted when she wen'
	tiny little bloke, my dad was
	by the time i was six i could lift him up an' put him on top o' the dresser if he annoyed me
	used ter make him laugh
	hagrid's deep voice broke
	madame maxime was listening, motionless, apparently staring at the silvery fountain
	but he died, o' course, jus' after i started school
	sorta had ter make me own way after that
	dumbledore was a real help, mind
	very kind ter me, he was
	hagrid pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief and blew his nose heavily
	what about you which side you got it onbut madame maxime had suddenly got to her feet
	it is chilly, she said  but whatever the weather was doing, it was nowhere near as cold as her voice
	i think i will go in now
	eh said hagrid blankly
	no, don go i've  i've never met another one beforeanuzzer what, precisely said madame maxime, her tone icy
	harry could have told hagrid it was best not to answer he stood there in the shadows gritting his teeth, hoping against hope he wouldn't  but it was no good
	another halfgiant, o' course said hagrid
	'ow dare you shrieked madame maxime
	her voice exploded through the peaceful night air like a foghorn behind him
	harry heard fleur and roger fall out of their rosebush
	i 'ave nevair been more insulted in my life  'alfgiant  moi  i 'ave  i 'ave big bonesshe stormed away great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into the air as she passed, angrily pushing aside bushes
	hagrid was still sitting on the bench, staring after her
	it was much too dark to make out his expression
	then, after about a minute, he stood up and strode away, not back to the castle, but off out into the dark grounds in the direction of his cabin
	c'mon, harry said, very quietly to ron
	what's up said harry, looking at him
	ron looked around at harry, his expression very serious indeed
	did you know he whispered
	about hagrid being halfgiantno, harry said, shrugging
	so whathe knew immediately, from the look ron was giving him, that he was once again revealing his ignorance of the wizarding world
	brought up by the dursleys, there were many things that wizards took for granted that were revelations to harry, but these surprises had become fewer with each successive year
	now, however, he could tell that most wizards would not have said so what upon finding out that one of their friends had a giantess for a mother
	i'll explain inside, said ron quietly, c'mon
	fleur and roger davies had disappeared, probably into a more private clump of bushes
	harry and ron returned to the great hall
	parvati and padma were now sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of beauxbatons boys, and hermione was once more dancing with krum
	harry and ron sat down at a table far removed from the dance floor
	so harry prompted ron
	what's the problem with giantswell, they're
	ron struggled for words
	not very nice, he finished lamely
	there's nothing wrong with hagridi know there isn't, but
	blimey, no wonder he keeps it quiet, ron said, shaking his head
	i always thought he'd got in the way of a bad engorgement charm when he was a kid or something
	didn't like to mention it
	but what's it matter if his mother was a giantess said harry
	no one who knows him will care, 'cos they'll know he's not dangerous, said ron slowly
	harry, they're just vicious, giants
	it's like hagrid said, it's in their natures, they're like trolls
	they just like killing, everyone knows that
	there aren't any left in britain now, though
	what happened to themwell, they were dying out anyway, and then loads got themselves killed by aurors
	there're supposed to be giants abroad, though
	they hide out in mountains mostly
	i don't know who maxime thinks she's kidding, harry said, watching madame maxime sitting alone at the judges' table, looking very somber
	if hagrid's halfgiant, she definitely is
	the only thing that's got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur
	harry and ron spent the rest of the ball discussing giants in their corner, neither of them having any inclination to dance
	harry tried not to watch cho and cedric too much it gave him a strong desire to kick something
	when the weird sisters finished playing at midnight, everyone gave them a last, loud round of applause and started to wend their way into the entrance hall
	many people were expressing the wish that the ball could have gone on longer, but harry was perfectly happy to be going to bed as far as he was concerned, the evening hadn't been much fun
	out in the entrance hall, harry and ron saw hermione saying good night to krum before he went back to the durmstrang ship
	she gave ron a very cold look and swept past him up the marble staircase without speaking
	harry and ron followed her, but halfway up the staircase harry heard someone calling him
	heyharryit was cedric diggory
	harry could see cho waiting for him in the entrance hall below
	yeah  said harry coldly as cedric ran up the stairs toward him
	cedric looked as though he didn't want to say whatever it was in front of ron, who shrugged, looking badtempered, and continued to climb the stairs
	cedric lowered his voice as ron disappeared
	i owe you one for telling me about the dragons
	you know that golden egg  does yours wail when you open ityeah, said harry
	take a bath, okaywhattake a bath, and  er  take the egg with you, and  er  just mull things over in the hot water
	it'll help you think
	tell you what, cedric said, use the prefects' bathroom
	fourth door to the left of that statue of boris the bewildered on the fifth floor
	password's 'pine fresh
	want to say good night he grinned at harry again and hurried back down the stairs to cho
	harry walked back to gryffindor tower alone
	that had been extremely strange advice
	why would a bath help him to work out what the wailing egg meant  was cedric pulling his leg  was he trying to make harry look like a fool, so cho would like him even more by comparisonthe fat lady and her friend vi were snoozing in the picture over the portrait hole
	harry had to yell fairy lights before he woke them up, and when he did, they were extremely irritated
	he climbed into the common room and found ron and hermione having a blazing row
	standing ten feet apart, they were bellowing at each other, each scarlet in the face
	well, if you don't like it, you know what the solution is, don't you  yelled hermione her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now, and her face was screwed up in anger
	oh yeah ron yelled back
	what's thatnext time there's a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resortron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as hermione turned on her heel and stormed up the girls' staircase to bed
	ron turned to look at harry
	well, he sputtered, looking thunderstruck, well  that just proves  completely missed the point harry didn't say anything
	he liked being back on speaking terms with ron too much to speak his mind right now  but he somehow thought that hermione had gotten the point much better than ron had
	chapter twentyfour  rita skeeter's scoopeverybody got up late on boxing day
	the gryffindor common room was much quieter than it had been lately, many yawns punctuating the lazy conversations
	hermione's hair was bushy again she confessed to harry that she had used liberal amounts of sleekeazy's hair potion on it for the ball, but it's way too much bother to do every day, she said matteroffactly, scratching a purring crookshanks behind the ears
	ron and hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument
	they were being quite friendly to each other, though oddly formal
	ron and harry wasted no time in telling hermione about the conversation they had overheard between madame maxime and hagrid, but hermione didn't seem to find the news that hagrid was a halfgiant nearly as shocking as ron did
	well, i thought he must be, she said, shrugging
	i knew he couldn't be pure giant because they're about twenty feet tall
	but honestly, all this hysteria about giants
	they can't all be horrible
	it's the same sort of prejudice that people have toward werewolves
	it's just bigotry, isn't itron looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly, but perhaps he didn't want another row, because he contented himself with shaking his head disbelievingly while hermione wasn't looking
	it was time now to think of the homework they had neglected during the first week of the holidays
	everybody seemed to be feeling rather flat now that christmas was over  everybody except harry, that is, who was starting once again to feel slightly nervous
	the trouble was that february the twentyfourth looked a lot closer from this side of christmas, and he still hadn't done anything about working out the clue inside the golden egg
	he therefore started taking the egg out of his trunk every time he went up to the dormitory, opening it, and listening intently, hoping that this time it would make some sense
	he strained to think what the sound reminded him of, apart from thirty musical saws, but he had never heard anything else like it
	he closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and opened it again to see if the sound had changed, but it hadn't
	he tried asking the egg questions, shouting over all the wailing, but nothing happened
	he even threw the egg across the room  though he hadn't really expected that to help
	harry had not forgotten the hint that cedric had given him, but his lessthanfriendly feelings toward cedric just now meant that he was keen not to take his help if he could avoid it
	in any case, it seemed to him that if cedric had really wanted to give harry a hand, he would have been a lot more explicit
	he, harry, had told cedric exactly what was coming in the first task  and cedric's idea of a fair exchange had been to tell harry to take a bath
	well, he didn't need that sort of rubbishy help  not from someone who kept walking down corridors hand in hand with cho, anyway
	and so the first day of the new term arrived, and harry set off to lessons, weighed down with books, parchment, and quills as usual, but also with the lurking worry of the egg heavy in his stomach, as though he were carrying that around with him too
	snow was still thick upon the grounds, and the greenhouse windows were covered in condensation so thick that they couldn't see out of them in herbology
	nobody was looking forward to care of magical creatures much in this weather, though as ron said, the skrewts would probably warm them up nicely, either by chasing them, or blasting off so forcefully that hagrid's cabin would catch fire
	when they arrived at hagrid 's cabin, however, they found an elderly witch with closely cropped gray hair and a very prominent chin standing before his front door
	hurry up, now, the bell rang five minutes ago, she barked at them as they struggled toward her through the snow
	who're you said ron, staring at her
	wheres hagrid my name is professor grubblyplank, she said briskly
	i am your temporary care of magical creatures teacher
	where's hagrid harry repeated loudly
	he is indisposed, said professor grubblyplank shortly
	soft and unpleasant laughter reached harrys ears
	he turned draco malfoy and the rest of the slytherins were joining the class
	all of them looked gleeful, and none of them looked surprised to see professor grubblyplank
	this way, please, said professor grubblyplank, and she strode off around the paddock where the beauxbatons horses were shivering
	harry, ron, and hermione followed her, looking back over their shoulders at hagrid's cabin
	all the curtains were closed
	was hagrid in there, alone and illwhat's wrong with hagrid  harry said, hurrying to catch up with professor grubblyplank
	never you mind, she said as though she thought he was being nosy
	i do mind, though, said harry hotly
	what's up with himprofessor grubblyplank acted as though she couldn't hear him
	she led them past the paddock where the huge beauxbatons horses were standing, huddled against the cold, and toward a tree on the edge of the forest, where a large and beautiful unicorn was tethered
	many of the girls ooooohed at the sight of the unicorn
	oh it's so beautiful whispered lavender brown
	how did she get it  they're supposed to be really hard to catchthe unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow all around look gray
	it was pawing the ground nervously with its golden hooves and throwing back its horned head
	boys keep back barked professor grubblyplank, throwing out an arm and catching harry hard in the chest
	they prefer the woman's touch, unicorns
	girls to the front, and approach with care, come on, easy does it
	she and the girls walked slowly forward toward the unicorn, leaving the boys standing near the paddock fence, watching
	the moment professor grubblyplank was out of earshot
	what d'you reckons wrong with him you don't think a skrewt  oh he hasn't been attacked, potter, if that's what you're thinking, said malfoy softly
	no, he's just too ashamed to show his big, ugly face
	what d'you mean  said harry sharply
	malfoy put his hand inside the pocket of his robes and pulled out a folded page of newsprint
	there you go, he said
	hate to break it to you
	he smirked as harry snatched the page, unfolded it, and read it, with ron, seamus, dean, and neville looking over his shoulder
	it was an article topped with a picture of hagrid looking extremely shifty
	dumbledore's giant mistakealbus dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry, has never been afraid to make controversial staff appointments, writes rita skeeter, special correspondent
	in september of this year, he hired alastor madeye moody, the notoriously jinxhappy exauror, to teach defense against the dark arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows at the ministry of magic, given moody's wellknown habit of attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence
	madeye moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set beside the parthuman dumbledore employs to teach care of magical creatures
	rubeus hagrid, who admits to being expelled from hogwarts in his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever since, a job secured for him by dumbledore
	last year, however, hagrid used his mysterious influence over the headmaster to secure the additional post of care of magical creatures teacher, over the heads of many betterqualified candidates
	an alarmingly large and ferociouslooking man, hagrid has been using his newfound authority to terrify the students in his care with a succession of horrific creatures
	while dumbledore turns a blind eye, hagrid has maimed several pupils during a series of lessons that many admit to being very frightening
	'i was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend vincent crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm, says draco malfoy, a fourthyear student
	we all hate hagrid, but we're just too scared to say anything
	hagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of intimidation, however
	in conversation with a daily prophet reporter last month, he admitted breeding creatures he has dubbed blastended skrewts, highly dangerous crosses between manticores and firecrabs
	the creation of new breeds of magical creature is, of course, an activity usually closely observed by the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures
	hagrid, however, considers himself to be above such petty restrictions
	i was just having some fun, he says, before hastily changing the subject
	as if this were not enough, the daily prophet has now unearthed evidence that hagrid is not  as he has always pretended  a pureblood wizard
	he is not, in fact, even pure human
	his mother, we can exclusively reveal, is none other than the giantess fridwulfa, whose whereabouts are currently unknown
	bloodthirsty and brutal, the giants brought themselves to the point of extinction by warring amongst themselves during the last century
	the handful that remained joined the ranks of hewhomustnotbenamed, and were responsible for some of the worst mass muggle killings of his reign of terror
	while many of the giants who served hewhomustnotbenamed were killed by aurors working against the dark side, fridwulfa was not among them
	it is possible she escaped to one of the giant communities still existing in foreign mountain ranges
	if his antics during care of magical creatures lessons are any guide, however, fridwulfa's son appears to have inherited her brutal nature
	in a bizarre twist, hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around youknowwho's fall from power  thereby driving hagrid's own mother, like the rest of youknowwho's supporters, into hiding
	perhaps harry potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend  but albus dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that harry potter, along with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating with partgiants
	harry finished reading and looked up at ron, whose mouth was hanging open
	how did she find out he whispered
	but that wasn't what was bothering harry
	what d'you mean, 'we all hate hagrid'  harry spat at malfoy
	what's this rubbish about him  he pointed at crabbe  getting a bad bite off a flobberworm  they haven't even got teethcrabbe was sniggering, apparently very pleased with himself
	well, i think this should put an end to the oaf's teaching career, said malfoy, his eyes glinting
	and there was me thinking he'd just swallowed a bottle of skelegro when he was young
	none of the mummies and daddies are going to like this at all
	they'll be worried he'll eat their kids, ha, ha
	youare you paying attention over thereprofessor grubblyplanks voice carried over to the boys the girls were all clustered around the unicorn now, stroking it
	harry was so angry that the daily prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical properties professor grubblyplank was now enumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could hear too
	i hope she stays, that woman said parvati patil when the lesson had ended and they were all heading back to the castle for lunch
	that's more what i thought care of magical creatures would be like
	proper creatures like unicorns, not monsters
	what about hagrid harry said angrily as they went up the steps
	what about him said parvati in a hard voice
	he can still be gamekeeper, can't heparvati had been very cool toward harry since the ball
	he supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but she seemed to have had a good time all the same
	she was certainly telling anybody who would listen that she had made arrangements to meet the boy from beauxbatons in hogsmeade on the next weekend trip
	that was a really good lesson, said hermione as they entered the great hall
	i didn't know half the things professor grubblyplank told us about uni look at this  harry snarled, and he shoved the daily prophet article under hermione's nose
	hermione's mouth fell open as she read
	her reaction was exactly the same as ron's
	how did that horrible skeeter woman find out you don't think hagrid told herno, said harry, leading the way over to the gryffindor table and throwing himself into a chair, furious
	he never even told us, did he  i reckon she was so mad he wouldn't give her loads of horrible stuff about me, she went ferreting around to get him back
	maybe she heard him telling madame maxime at the ball, said hermione quietly
	we'd have seen her in the garden said ron
	anyway, she's not supposed to come into school anymore, hagrid said dumbledore banned her
	maybe she's got an invisibility cloak, said harry, ladling chicken casserole onto his plate and splashing it everywhere in his anger
	sort of thing she'd do, isn't it, hide in bushes listening to people
	like you and ron did, you mean, said hermione
	we weren't trying to hear him said ron indignantly
	we didn't have any choice  the stupid prat, talking about his giantess mother where anyone could have heard himwe've got to go and see him, said harry
	this evening, after divination
	tell him we want him back
	you do want him back he shot at hermione
	i  well, i'm not going to pretend it didn't make a nice change, having a proper care of magical creatures lesson for once  but i do want hagrid back, of course i do  hermione added hastily, quailing under harry's furious stare
	so that evening after dinner, the three of them left the castle once more and went down through the frozen grounds to hagrid's cabin
	they knocked, and fang's booming barks answered
	hagrid, it's us harry shouted, pounding on the door
	open uphagrid didn't answer
	they could hear fang scratching at the door, whining, but it didn't open
	they hammered on it for ten more minutes ron even went and banged on one of the windows, but there was no response
	what's he avoiding us for  hermione said when they had finally given up and were walking back to the school
	he surely doesn't think we'd care about him being halfgiantbut it seemed that hagrid did care
	they didn't see a sign of him all week
	he didn't appear at the staff table at mealtimes, they didn't see him going about his gamekeeper duties on the grounds, and professor grubblyplank continued to take the care of magical creatures classes
	malfoy was gloating at every possible opportunity
	missing your halfbreed pal he kept whispering to harry whenever there was a teacher around, so that he was safe from harry's retaliation
	missing the elephantmanthere was a hogsmeade visit halfway through january
	hermione was very surprised that harry was going to go
	i just thought you'd want to take advantage of the common room being quiet, she said
	really get to work on that egg
	oh i  i reckon i've got a pretty good idea what it's about now, harry lied
	have you really  said hermione, looking impressed
	well doneharrys insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them
	he still had five weeks to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was ages
	whereas if he went into hogsmeade, he might run into hagrid, and get a chance to persuade him to come back
	he, ron, and hermione left the castle together on saturday and set off through the cold, wet grounds toward the gates
	as they passed the durmstrang ship moored in the lake, they saw viktor krum emerge onto the deck, dressed in nothing but swimming trunks
	he was very skinny indeed, but apparently a lot tougher than he looked, because he climbed up onto the side of the ship, stretched out his arms, and dived, right into the lake
	he's mad  said harry, staring at krums dark head as it bobbed out into the middle of the lake
	it must be freezing, it's januaryit's a lot colder where he comes from, said hermione
	i suppose it feels quite warm to him
	yeah, but there's still the giant squid, said ron
	he didn't sound anxious  if anything, he sounded hopeful
	hermione noticed his tone of voice and frowned
	he's really nice, you know, she said
	he's not at all like you'd think, coming from durmstrang
	he likes it much better here, he told me
	he hadn't mentioned viktor krum since the ball, but harry had found a miniature arm under his bed on boxing day, which had looked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing bulgarian quidditch robes
	harry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of hagrid all the way down the slushy high street, and suggested a visit to the three broomsticks once he had ascertained that hagrid was not in any of the shops
	the pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look around at all the tables told harry that hagrid wasn't there
	heart sinking, he went up to the bar with ron and hermione, ordered three butterbeers from madam rosmerta, and thought gloomily that he might just as well have stayed behind and listened to the egg wailing after all
	doesn't he ever go into the office hermione whispered suddenly
	lookshe pointed into the mirror behind the bar, and harry saw ludo bagman reflected there, sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch of goblins
	bagman was talking very fast in a low voice to the goblins, all of whom had their arms crossed and were looking rather menacing
	harry thought, that bagman was here at the three broomsticks on a weekend when there was no triwizard event, and therefore no judging to be done
	he watched bagman in the mirror
	he was looking strained again, quite as strained as he had that night in the forest before the dark mark had appeared
	but just then bagman glanced over at the bar, saw harry, and stood up
	in a moment, in a moment  harry heard him say brusquely to the goblins, and bagman hurried through the pub toward harry, his boyish grin back in place
	how are you been hoping to run into you everything going all rightfine, thanks, said harry
	wonder if i could have a quick, private word, harry  said bagman eagerly
	you couldn't give us a moment, you two, could youer  okay, said ron, and he and hermione went off to find a table
	bagman led harry along the bar to the end furthest from madam rosmerta
	well, i just thought i'd congratulate you again on your splendid performance against that horntail, harry, said bagman
	thanks, said harry, but he knew this couldn't be all that bagman wanted to say, because he could have congratulated harry in front of ron and hermione
	bagman didn't seem in any particular rush to spill the beans, though
	harry saw him glance into the mirror over the bar at the goblins, who were all watching him and harry in silence through their dark, slanting eyes
	absolute nightmare, said bagman to harry in an undertone, noticing harry watching the goblins too
	their english isn't too good
	it's like being back with all the bulgarians at the quidditch world cup
	but at least they used sign language another human could recognize
	this lot keep gabbling in gobbledegook
	and i only know one word of gobbledegook
	'  i don't like to use it in case they think i'm threatening them
	he gave a short, booming laugh
	what do they want harry said, noticing how the goblins were still watching bagman very closely
	said bagman, looking suddenly nervous
	they're looking for barty crouch
	why are they looking for him here said harry
	he's at the ministry in london, isn't heer
	as a matter of fact, i've no idea where he is, said bagman
	stopped coming to work
	been absent for a couple of weeks now
	young percy, his assistant, says he's ill
	apparently he's just been sending instructions in by owl
	but would you mind not mentioning that to anyone
	harry  because rita skeeter's still poking around everywhere she can, and i'm willing to bet she'd work up bartys illness into something sinister
	probably say he's gone missing like bertha jorkins
	have you heard anything about bertha jorkins harry asked
	no, said bagman, looking strained again
	i've got people looking, of course
	about time, thought harry and it's all very strange
	she definitely arrived in albania, because she met her second cousin there
	and then she left the cousin's house to go south and see an aunt
	and she seems to have vanished without trace en route
	blowed if i can see where she's got to
	she doesn't seem the type to elope, for instance
	what are we doing, talking about goblins and bertha jorkins  i really wanted to ask you  he lowered his voice  how are you getting on with your golden egger
	not bad, harry said untruthfully
	bagman seemed to know he wasn't being honest
	listen, harry, he said still in a very low voice, i feel very bad about all this
	you were thrown into this tournament, you didn't volunteer for it
	his voice was so quiet now, harry had to lean closer to listen if i can help at all
	a prod in the right direction
	i've taken a liking to you
	the way you got past that dragon
	well, just say the word
	harry stared up into bagman's round, rosy face and his wide, babyblue eyes
	we're supposed to work out the clues alone, aren't we he said, careful to keep his voice casual and not sound as though he was accusing the head of the department of magical games and sports of breaking the rules
	well, yes, said bagman impatiently, but  come on
	harry  we all want a hogwarts victory, don't wehave you offered cedric help harry said
	the smallest of frowns creased bagman's smooth face
	no, i haven't, he said
	i  well, like i say, i've taken a liking to you
	just thought i'd offer
	well, thanks, said harry, but i think i'm nearly there with the egg
	couple more days should crack it
	he wasn't entirely sure why he was refusing bagman's help, except that bagman was almost a stranger to him, and accepting his assistance would feel somehow much more like cheating than asking advice from ron, hermione, or sirius
	bagman looked almost affronted, but couldn't say much more as fred and george turned up at that point
	bagman, said fred brightly
	can we buy you a drinker
	no, said bagman, with a last disappointed glance at harry, no, thank you, boys
	fred and george looked quite as disappointed as bagman, who was surveying harry as though he had let him down badly
	well, i must dash, he said
	he hurried out of the pub
	the goblins all slid off their chairs and exited after him
	harry went to rejoin ron and hermione
	what did he want ron said, the moment harry had sat down
	he offered to help me with the golden egg, said harry
	he shouldn't be doing that said hermione, looking very shocked
	he's one of the judges  and anyway, you've already worked it out  haven't youer
	well, i don't think dumbledore would like it if he knew bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat  said hermione, still looking deeply disapproving
	i hope he's trying to help cedric as muchhe's not, i asked, said harry
	who cares if diggorys getting help said ron
	harry privately agreed
	those goblins didn't look very friendly, said hermione, sipping her butterbeer
	what were they doing herelooking for crouch, according to bagman, said harry
	hasn't been into work
	maybe percys poisoning him, said ron
	probably thinks if crouch snuffs it he'll be made head of the department of international magical cooperation
	hermione gave ron a don'tjokeaboutthingslikethat look, and said, funny, goblins looking for mr
	they'd normally deal with the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures
	crouch can speak loads of different languages, though, said harry
	maybe they need an interpreter
	worrying about poor 'ickle goblins, now, are you  ron asked hermione
	thinking of starting up s
	or something  society for the protection of ugly goblinsha, ha, ha, said hermione sarcastically
	goblins don't need protection
	haven't you been listening to what professor binns has been telling us about goblin rebellionsno, said harry and ron together
	well, there quite capable of dealing with wizards, said hermione, taking another sip of butterbeer
	they're very clever
	they're not like houseelves, who never stick up for themselves
	uhoh, said ron, staring at the door
	rita skeeter had just entered
	she was wearing bananayellow robes today her long nails were painted shocking pink, and she was accompanied by her paunchy photographer
	she bought drinks, and she and the photographer made their way through the crowds to a table nearby
	harry, ron, and hermione glaring at her as she approached
	she was talking fast and looking very satisfied about something
	didn't seem very keen to talk to us, did he, bozo  now, why would that be, do you think  and what's he doing with a pack of goblins in tow anyway  showing them the sights
	he was always a bad liar
	reckon something's up  think we should do a bit of digging  'disgraced exhead of magical games and sports, ludo bagman
	' snappy start to a sentence, bozo  we just need to find a story to fit it trying to ruin someone else's life said harry loudly
	a few people looked around
	rita skeeter's eyes widened behind her jeweled spectacles as she saw who had spoken
	harry she said, beaming
	how lovely why don't you come and join i wouldn't come near you with a tenfoot broomstick, said harry furiously
	what did you do that to hagrid for, ehrita skeeter raised her heavily penciled eyebrows
	our readers have a right to the truth, harry
	i am merely doing mywho cares if he's halfgiant  harry shouted
	there's nothing wrong with himthe whole pub had gone very quiet
	madam rosmerta was staring over from behind the bar, apparently oblivious to the fact that the flagon she was filling with mead was overflowing
	rita skeeters smile flickered very slightly, but she hitched it back almost at once she snapped open her crocodileskin handbag, pulled out her quickquotes quill, and said, how about giving me an interview about the hagrid you know
	harry  the man behind the muscles your unlikely friendship and the reasons behind it
	would you call him a father substitutehermione stood up very abruptly, her butterbeer clutched in her hand as though it were a grenade
	you horrible woman, she said, through gritted teeth, you don't care, do you, anything for a story, and anyone will do, wont they  even ludo bagman sit down, you silly little girl, and don't talk about things you don't understand, said rita skeeter coldly, her eyes hardening as they fell on hermione
	i know things about ludo bagman that would make your hair curl
	not that it needs it  she added, eyeing hermione's bushy hair
	let's go, said hermione, c'mon
	they left many people were staring at them as they went
	harry glanced back as they reached the door
	rita skeeter's quickquotes quill was out it was zooming backward and forward over a piece of parchment on the table
	she'll be after you next, hermione, said ron in a low and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the street
	let her try said hermione defiantly she was shaking with rage
	i'll show her silly little girl, am i  oh, i'll get her back for this
	first harry, then hagrid
	you don't want to go upsetting rita skeeter, said ron nervously
	i'm serious, hermione, she'll dig up something on you my parents don't read the daily prophet
	she can't scare me into hiding  said hermione, now striding along so fast that it was all harry and ron could do to keep up with her
	the last time harry had seen hermione in a rage like this, she had hit draco malfoy around the face
	and hagrid isn't hiding anymore  he should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him  come onbreaking into a run, she led them all the way back up the road, through the gates flanked by winged boars, and up through the grounds to hagrid's cabin
	the curtains were still drawn, and they could hear fang barking as they approached
	hagrid hermione shouted, pounding on his front door
	hagrid, that's enough  we know you're in there  nobody cares if your mum was a giantess, hagrid  you can't let that foul skeeter woman do this to you  hagrid, get out here, you're just being the door opened
	hermione said, about t and then stopped, very suddenly, because she had found herself facetoface, not with hagrid, but with albus dumbledore
	good afternoon, he said pleasantly, smiling down at them
	weerwe wanted to see hagrid, said hermione in a rather small voice
	yes, i surmised as much, said dumbledore, his eyes twinkling
	why don't you come inoh
	she, ron, and harry went into the cabin fang launched himself upon harry the moment he entered, barking madly and trying to lick his ears
	harry fended off fang and looked around
	hagrid was sitting at his table, where there were two large mugs of tea
	he looked a real mess
	his face was blotchy, his eyes swollen, and he had gone to the other extreme where his hair was concerned far from trying to make it behave, it now looked like a wig of tangled wire
	hi, hagrid, said harry
	'lo, he said in a very hoarse voice
	more tea, i think, said dumbledore, closing the door behind harry, ron, and hermione, drawing out his wand, and twiddling it a revolving tea tray appeared in midair along with a plate of cakes
	dumbledore magicked the tray onto the table, and everybody sat down
	there was a slight pause, and then dumbledore said, did you by any chance hear what miss granger was shouting, hagridhermione went slightly pink, but dumbledore smiled at her and continued, hermione, harry, and ron still seem to want to know you, judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door
	of course we still want to know you  harry said, staring at hagrid
	you don't think anything that skeeter cow  sorry, professor, he added quickly, looking at dumbledore
	i have gone temporarily deaf and haven't any idea what you said
	harry, said dumbledore, twiddling his thumbs and staring at the ceiling
	erright, said harry sheepishly
	i just meanthagrid, how could you think we'd care what thatwomanwrote about youtwo fat tears leaked out of hagrid's beetleblack eyes and fell slowly into his tangled beard
	living proof of what i've been telling you, hagrid, said dumbledore, still looking carefully up at the ceiling
	i have shown you the letters from the countless parents who remember you from their own days here, telling me in no uncertain terms that if i sacked you, they would have something to say about it not all of 'em, said hagrid hoarsely
	not all of 'em wan me ter stay
	really, hagrid, if you are holding out for universal popularity, i'm afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time, said dumbledore, now peering sternly over his halfmoon spectacles
	not a week has passed since i became headmaster of this school when i haven't had at least one owl complaining about the way i run it
	but what should i do  barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybodyyeh  yeh're not halfgiant  said hagrid croakily
	hagrid, look what i've got for relatives  harry said furiously
	look at the dursleysan excellent point, said professor dumbledore
	my own brother, aberforth, was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat
	it was all over the papers, but did aberforth hide  no, he did not  he held his head high and went about his business as usual of course, i'm not entirely sure he can read, so that may not have been bravery
	come back and teach, hagrid, said hermione quietly, please come back, we really miss you
	more tears leaked out down his cheeks and into his tangled beard
	i refuse to accept your resignation, hagrid, and i expect you back at work on monday, he said
	you will join me for breakfast at eightthirty in the great hall
	good afternoon to you all
	dumbledore left the cabin, pausing only to scratch fangs ears
	when the door had shut behind him, hagrid began to sob into his dustbinlidsized hands
	hermione kept patting his arm, and at last, hagrid looked up, his eyes very red indeed, and said, great man, dumbledore
	yeah, he is, said ron
	can i have one of these cakes, hagrid help yerself, said hagrid, wiping his eyes on the back of his hand
	ar, he's righ', o' course  yeh're all righ'
	my ol' dad woulda bin ashamed o' the way i've bin behavin'
	more tears leaked out, but he wiped them away more forcefully, and said, never shown you a picture of my old dad, have i  here
	hagrid got up, went over to his dresser, opened a drawer, and pulled out a picture of a short wizard with hagrid's crinkled black eyes, beaming as he sat on top of hagrid's shoulder
	hagrid was a good seven or eight feet tall, judging by the apple tree beside him, but his face was beardless, young, round, and smooth  he looked hardly older than eleven
	tha was taken jus' after i got inter hogwarts, hagrid croaked
	dad was dead chuffed
	thought i migh' not be a wizard, see, 'cos me mum
	'course, i never was great shakes at magic, really
	but at least he never saw me expelled
	died, see, in me second year
	dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after dad went
	got me the gamekeeper job
	trusts people, he does
	gives 'em second chances
	tha's what sets him apar' from other heads, see
	he'll accept anyone at hogwarts, s'long as they've got the talent
	knows people can turn out okay even if their families weren'
	all tha' respectable
	but some don understand that
	there's some who'd always hold it against yeh
	there's some who'd even pretend they just had big bones rather than stand up an' say  i am what i am, an' i'm not ashamed
	'never be ashamed,' my ol' dad used ter say, 'there's some who'll hold it against you, but they're not worth botherin' with
	i'm not botherin' with her no more, i promise yeh that
	i'll give her big bones
	harry, ron, and hermione looked at one another nervously harry would rather have taken fifty blastended skrewts for a walk than admit to hagrid that he had overheard him talking to madame maxime, but hagrid was still talking, apparently unaware that he had said anything odd
	yeh know wha, harry he said, looking up from the photograph of his father, his eyes very bright, when i firs' met you, you reminded me o' me a bit
	mum an' dad gone, an' you was feelin' like yeh wouldn' fit in at hogwarts, remember  not sure yeh were really up to it
	an' now look at yeh, harry  school championhe looked at harry for a moment and then said, very seriously, yeh know what i'd love
	harry  i'd love yeh ter win, i really would
	yeh don' have ter be pureblood ter do it
	yeh don have ter be ashamed of what yeh are
	it'd show 'em dumbledore's the one who's got it righ', lettin' anyone in as long as they can do magic
	how you doin' with that egg, harrygreat, said harry
	hagrid's miserable face broke into a wide, watery smile
	you show 'em, harry, you show 'em
	lying to hagrid wasn't quite like lying to anyone else
	harry went back to the castle later that afternoon with ron and hermione, unable to banish the image of the happy expression on hagrid's whiskery face as he had imagined harry winning the tournament
	the incomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than ever on harrys conscience that evening, and by the time he had got into bed, he had made up his mind  it was time to shelve his pride and see if cedric's hint was worth anything
	chapter twentyfive  the egg and the eyeharry had no idea how long a bath he would need to work out the secret of the golden egg, he decided to do it at night, when he would be able to take as much time as he wanted
	reluctant though he was to accept more favors from cedric, he also decided to use the prefects' bathroom far fewer people were allowed in there, so it was much less likely that he would be disturbed
	harry planned his excursion carefully, because he had been caught out of bed and outofbounds by filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once before, and had no desire to repeat the experience
	the invisibility cloak would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, harry thought he would take the marauders map, which, next to the cloak, was the most useful aid to rulebreaking harry owned
	the map showed the whole of hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most important of all, it revealed the people inside the castle as minuscule, labeled dots, moving around the corridors, so that harry would be forewarned if somebody was approaching the bathroom
	on thursday night, harry sneaked up to bed, put on the cloak, crept back downstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when hagrid had shown him the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open
	this time it was ron who waited outside to give the fat lady the password banana fritters, good luck, ron muttered, climbing into the room as harry crept out past him
	it was awkward moving under the cloak tonight, because harry had the heavy egg under one arm and the map held in front of his nose with the other
	however, the moonlit corridors were empty and silent, and by checking the map at strategic intervals, harry was able to ensure that he wouldn't run into anyone he wanted to avoid
	when he reached the statue of boris the bewildered, a lostlooking wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands, he located the right door, leaned close to it, and muttered the password, pine fresh, just as cedric had told him
	the door creaked open
	harry slipped inside, bolted the door behind him, and pulled off the invisibility cloak, looking around
	his immediate reaction was that it would be worth becoming a prefect just to be able to use this bathroom
	it was softly lit by a splendid candlefilled chandelier, and everything was made of white marble, including what looked like an empty, rectangular swimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor
	about a hundred golden taps stood all around the pools edges, each with a differently colored jewel set into its handle
	there was also a diving board
	long white linen curtains hung at the windows a large pile of fluffy white towels sat in a corner, and there was a single goldenframed painting on the wall
	it featured a blonde mermaid whowas fast asleep on a rock, her long hair over her face
	it fluttered every time she snored
	harry moved forward, looking around, his footsteps echoing off the walls
	magnificent though the bathroom was  and quite keen though he was to try out a few of those taps  now he was here he couldn't quite suppress the feeling that cedric might have been having him on
	how on earth was this supposed to help solve the mystery of the egg  nevertheless, he put one of the huffy towels, the cloak, the map, and the egg at the side of the swimmingpoolsized bath, then knelt down and turned on a few of the taps
	he could tell at once that they carried different sorts of bubble bath mixed with the water, though it wasn't bubble bath as harry had ever experienced it
	one tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of footballs another poured icewhite foam so thick that harry thought it would have supported his weight if he'd cared to test it a third sent heavily perfumed purple clouds hovering over the surface of the water
	harry amused himself for awhile turning the taps on and off, particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off the surface of the water in large arcs
	then, when the deep pool was full of hot water, foam, and bubbles, which took a very short time considering its size, harry turned off all the taps, pulled off his pajamas, slippers, and dressing gown, and slid into the water
	it was so deep that his feet barely touched the bottom, and he actually did a couple of lengths before swimming back to the side and treading water, staring at the egg
	highly enjoyable though it was to swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of differentcolored steam wafting all around him, no stroke of brilliance came to him, no sudden burst of understanding
	harry stretched out his arms, lifted the egg in his wet hands, and opened it
	the wailing, screeching sound filled the bathroom, echoing and reverberating off the marble walls, but it sounded just as incomprehensible as ever, if not more so with all the echoes
	he snapped it shut again, worried that the sound would attract filch, wondering whether that hadn't been cedric's plan  and then, making him jump so badly that he dropped the egg, which clattered away across the bathroom floor, someone spoke
	i'd try putting it in the water, if i were you
	harry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock
	he stood up, sputtering, and saw the ghost of a very glumlooking girl sitting crosslegged on top of one of the taps
	it was moaning myrtle, who was usually to be heard sobbing in the sbend of a toilet three floors below
	myrtle  harry said in outrage, i'm  i'm not wearing anythingthe foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but he had a nasty feeling that myrtle had been spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since he had arrived
	i closed my eyes when you got in, she said, blinking at him through her thick spectacles
	you haven't been to see me for ages
	said harry, bending his knees slightly, just to make absolutely sure myrtle couldn't see anything but his head, i'm not supposed to come into your bathroom, am i it's a girls' one
	you didn't used to care, said myrtle miserably
	you used to be in there all the time
	this was true, though only because harry, ron, and hermione had found myrtle's outoforder toilets a convenient place to brew polyjuice potion in secret  a forbidden potion that had turned him and ron into living replicas of crabbe and goyle for an hour, so that they could sneak into the slytherin common room
	i got told off for going in there
	said harry, which was halftrue percy had once caught him coming out of myrtles bathroom
	i thought i'd better not come back after that
	said myrtle, picking at a spot on her chin in a morose sort of way
	i'd try the egg in the water
	that's what cedric diggory did
	have you been spying on him too  said harry indignantly
	what d'you do, sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take bathssometimes, said myrtle, rather slyly, but i've never come out to speak to anyone before
	i'm honored, said harry darkly
	you keep your eyes shuthe made sure myrtle had her glasses well covered before hoisting himself out of the bath, wrapping the towel firmly around his waist, and going to retrieve the egg
	once he was back in the water, myrtle peered through her fingers and said, go on, then
	open it under the waterharry lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface and opened it
	and this time, it did not wail
	a gurgling song was coming out of it, a song whose words he couldnt distinguish through the water
	you need to put your head under too, said myrtle, who seemed to be thoroughly enjoying bossing him around
	go onharry took a great breath and slid under the surface  and now, sitting on the marble bottom of the bubblefilled bath, he heard a chorus of eerie voices singing to him from the open egg in his handscome seek us where our voices sound,we cannot sing above the ground,and while you re searching, ponder thiswove taken what you'll sorely miss,an hour long you'll have to look,and to recover what we took,but past an hour the prospect's black,too late, it's gone, it wont come backharry let himself float back upward and broke the bubbly surface, shaking his hair out of his eyes
	'come seek us where our voices sound
	' and if i need persuading
	hang on, i need to listen again
	he sank back beneath the water
	it took three more underwater renditions of the egg's song before harry had it memorized then he trod water for a while, thinking hard, while myrtle sat and watched him
	i've got to go and look for people who can't use their voices above the ground
	who could that beslow, aren't youhe had never seen moaning myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a dose of polyjuice potion had given hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat
	harry stared around the bathroom, thinking
	if the voices could only be heard underwater, then it made sense for them to belong to underwater creatures
	he ran this theory past myrtle, who smirked at him
	well, thats what diggory thought, she said
	he lay there talking to himself for ages about it
	nearly all the bubbles had gone
	what lives in the lake, apart from the giant squidoh all sorts, she said
	i sometimes go down there
	sometimes don't have any choice, if someone flushes my toilet when i'm not expecting it
	trying not to think about moaning myrtle zooming down a pipe to the lake with the contents of a toilet
	harry said, well, does anything in there have a human voice  hang on harry's eyes had fallen on the picture of the snoozing mermaid on the wall
	myrtle, there aren't merpeople in there, are thereoooh, very good, she said, her thick glasses twinkling, it took diggory much longer than that  and that was with her awake too  myrtle jerked her head toward the mermaid with an expression of great dislike on her glum face  giggling and showing off and flashing her fins
	thats it, isn't it  said harry excitedly
	the second tasks to go and find the merpeople in the lake and
	but he suddenly realized what he was saying, and he felt the excitement drain out of him as though someone had just pulled a plug in his stomach
	he wasn't a very good swimmer he'd never had much practice
	dudley had had lessons in his youth, but aunt petunia and uncle vernon, no doubt hoping that harry would drown one day, hadn't bothered to give him any
	a couple of lengths of this bath were all very well, but that lake was very large, and very deep
	and merpeople would surely live right at the bottom
	myrtle, harry said slowly, how am i supposed to breatheat this, myrtle's eyes filled with sudden tears again
	tactless she muttered, groping in her robes for a handkerchief
	what's tactless said harry, bewildered
	talking about breathing in front of me  she said shrilly, and her voice echoed loudly around the bathroom
	she buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed loudly
	harry remembered how touchy myrtle had always been about being dead, but none of the other ghosts he knew made such a fuss about it
	sorry, he said impatiently
	i didn't mean  i just forgot
	oh yes, very easy to forget myrtle's dead, said myrtle, gulping, looking at him out of swollen eyes
	nobody missed me even when i was alive
	took them hours and hours to find my body  i know, i was sitting there waiting for them
	olive hornby came into the bathroom  are you in here again, sulking, myrtle'  she said, 'because professor dippet asked me to look for you ' and then she saw my body
	ooooh, she didn't forget it until her dying day, i made sure of that
	followed her around and reminded her, i did
	i remember at her brother's wedding but harry wasn't listening he was thinking about the merpeople's song again
	we've taken what you ii sorely miss
	that sounded as though they were going to steal something of his, something he had to get back
	what were they going to takeand then, of course, she went to the ministry of magic to stop me stalking her, so i had to come back here and live in my toilet
	good, said harry vaguely
	well, i'm a lot further on than i was
	shut your eyes again, will you  i'm getting out
	he retrieved the egg from the bottom of the bath, climbed out, dried himself, and pulled on his pajamas and dressing gown again
	will you come and visit me in my bathroom again sometime  moaning myrtle asked mournfully as harry picked up the invisibility cloak
	i'll try, harry said, though privately thinking the only way he'd be visiting myrtle's bathroom again was if every other toilet in the castle got blocked
	thanks for your help
	bye, 'bye, she said gloomily, and as harry put on the invisibllity cloak he saw her zoom back up the tap
	out in the dark corridor, harry examined the marauders map to check that the coast was still clear
	yes, the dots belonging to filch and his cat, mrs
	norris, were safely in their office
	nothing else seemed to be moving apart from peeves, though he was bouncing around the trophy room on the floor above
	harry had taken his first step back toward gryffindor tower when something else on the map caught his eye
	something distinctly odd
	peeves was not the only thing that was moving
	a single dot was flitting around a room in the bottom lefthand corner  snapes office
	but the dot wasn't labeled severus snape
	it was bartemius crouch
	harry stared at the dot
	crouch was supposed to be too ill to go to work or to come to the yule ball  so what was he doing, sneaking into hogwarts at one o'clock in the morning  harry watched closely as the dot moved around and around the room, pausing here and there
	harry hesitated, thinking
	and then his curiosity got the better of him
	he turned and set off in the opposite direction toward the nearest staircase
	he was going to see what crouch was up to
	harry walked down the stairs as quietly as possible, though the faces in some of the portraits still turned curiously at the squeak of a floorboard, the rustle of his pajamas
	he crept along the corridor below, pushed aside a tapestry about halfway along, and proceeded down a narrower staircase, a shortcut that would take him down two floors
	he kept glancing down at the map, wondering
	it just didn't seem in character, somehow, for correct, lawabiding mr
	crouch to be sneaking around somebody else's office this late at night
	and then, halfway down the staircase, not thinking about what he was doing, not concentrating on anything but the peculiar behavior of mr
	crouch, harrys leg suddenly sank right through the trick step neville always forgot to jump
	he gave an ungainly wobble, and the golden egg, still damp from the bath, slipped from under his arm
	he lurched forward to try and catch it, but too late the egg fell down the long staircase with a bang as loud as a bass drum on every step  the invisibility cloak slipped  harry snatched at it, and the marauder s map fluttered out of his hand and slid down six stairs, where, sunk in the step to above his knee, he couldn't reach it
	the golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom of the staircase, burst open, and began wailing loudly in the corridor below
	harry pulled out his wand and struggled to touch the marauder s map, to wipe it blank, but it was too far away to reach pulling the cloak back over himself harry straightened up, listening hard with his eyes screwed up with fear
	and, almost immediately peevesit was the unmistakable hunting cry of filch the caretaker
	harry could hear his rapid, shuffling footsteps coming nearer and nearer, his wheezy voice raised in fury
	what's this racket  wake up the whole castle, will you  i'll have you, peeves, i'll have you, you'll
	and what is thisfilch's footsteps halted there was a clink of metal on metal and the wailing stopped  filch had picked up the egg and closed it
	harry stood very still, one leg still jammed tightly in the magical step, listening
	any moment now, filch was going to pull aside the tapestry, expecting to see peeves
	and there would be no peeves
	but if he came up the stairs, he would spot the marauder's map
	and invisibility cloak or not, the map would show  harry potter standing exactly where he was
	egg  filch said quietly at the foot of the stairs
	norris was obviously with him  this is a triwizard clue  this belongs to a school championharry felt sick his heart was hammering very fast peeves  filch roared gleefully
	you've been stealinghe ripped back the tapestry below, and harry saw his horrible, pouchy face and bulging, pale eyes staring up the dark and to filch deserted staircase
	hiding, are you  he said softly
	i'm coming to get you, peeves
	you've gone and stolen a triwizard clue, peeves
	dumbledore'll have you out of here for this, you filthy, pilfering poltergeist
	filch started to climb the stairs, his scrawny, dustcolored cat at his heels
	morris's lamplike eyes, so very like her masters, were fixed directly upon harry
	he had had occasion before now to wonder whether the invisibility cloak worked on cats
	sick with apprehension, he watched filch drawing nearer and nearer in his old flannel dressing gown  he tried desperately to pull his trapped leg free, but it merely sank a few more inches  any second now, filch was going to spot the map or walk right into him filch whats going onfilch stopped a few steps below harry and turned
	at the foot of the stairs stood the only person who could make harry's situation worse  snape
	he was wearing a long gray nightshirt and he looked livid
	its peeves, professor, filch whispered malevolently
	he threw this egg down the stairs
	snape climbed up the stairs quickly and stopped beside filch
	harry gritted his teeth, convinced his loudly thumping heart would give him away at any second
	peeves said snape softly, staring at the egg in filch's hands
	but peeves couldn't get into my office
	this egg was in your office
	professorof course not, snape snapped
	i heard banging and wailing yes, professor, that was the egg   i was coming to investigate   peeves threw it
	professor  and when i passed my office, i saw that the torches were lit and a cupboard door was ajar  somebody has been searching itbut peeves couldn't  i know he couldn't, filch snape snapped again
	i seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break  snape looked up the stairs, straight through harry, and then down into the corridor below
	i want you to come and help me search for the intruder, filch
	i  yes, professor  but filch looked yearningly up the stairs, right through harry, who could see that he was very reluctant to forgo the chance of cornering peeves
	go, harry pleaded with him silently, go with snape
	norris was peering around filch's legs
	harry had the distinct impression that she could smell him
	why had he filled that bath with so much perfumed foamthe thing is, professor, said filch plaintively, the headmaster will have to listen to me this time
	peeves has been stealing from a student, it might be my chance to get him thrown out of the castle once and for all filch, i don't give a damn about that wretched poltergeist it's my office that's clunk
	snape stopped talking very abruptly
	he and filch both looked down at the foot of the stairs
	harry saw madeye moody limp into sight through the narrow gap between their heads
	moody was wearing his old traveling cloak over his nightshirt and leaning on his staff as usual
	pajama party, is it  he growled up the stairs
	professor snape and i heard noises, professor, said filch at once
	peeves the poltergeist, throwing things around as usual  and then professor snape discovered that someone had broken into his off shut up  snape hissed to filch
	moody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs
	harry saw moodys magical eye travel over snape, and then, unmistakably, onto himself
	harrys heart gave a horrible jolt
	moody could see through invisibility cloaks
	he alone could see the full strangeness of the scenesnape in his nightshirt, filch clutching the egg, and he, harry, trapped in the stairs behind them
	moody's lopsided gash of a mouth opened in surprise
	for a few seconds, he and harry stared straight into each other's eyes
	then moody closed his mouth and turned his blue eye upon snape again
	did i hear that correctly, snape he asked slowly
	someone broke into your officeit is unimportant, said snape coldly
	on the contrary, growled moody, it is very important
	who'd want to break into your officea student, i daresay, said snape
	harry could see a vein flickering horribly on snape's greasy temple
	it has happened before
	potion ingredients have gone missing from my private store cupboard
	students attempting illicit mixtures, no doubt
	reckon they were after potion ingredients, eh said moody
	not hiding anything else in your office, are youharry saw the edge of snapes sallow face turn a nasty brick color, the vein in his temple pulsing more rapidly
	you know i'm hiding nothing, moody, he said in a soft and dangerous voice, as you've searched my office pretty thoroughly yourself
	moodys face twisted into a smile
	auror's privilege, snape
	dumbledore told me to keep an eye dumbledore happens to trust me, said snape through clenched teeth
	i refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my officecourse dumbledore trusts you, growled moody
	hes a trusting man, isn't he believes in second chances
	but me  i say there are spots that don't come off, snape
	spots that never come off, d'you know what i meansnape suddenly did something very strange
	he seized his left forearm convulsively with his right hand, as though something on it had hurt him
	get back to bed, snape
	you don't have the authority to send me anywhere  snape hissed, letting go of his arm as though angry with himself
	i have as much right to prowl this school after dark as you doprowl away, said moody, but his voice was full of menace
	i look forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some time
	you've dropped something, by the way
	with a stab of horror
	harry saw moody point at the marauders map, still lying on the staircase six steps below him
	as snape and filch both turned to look at it, harry threw caution to the winds he raised his arms under the cloak and waved furiously at moody to attract his attention, mouthing it's mine  minesnape had reached out for it, a horrible expression of dawning comprehension on his face accio parchmentthe map flew up into the air, slipped through snapes outstretched fingers, and soared down the stairs into moodys hand
	my mistake, moody said calmly
	it's mine  must've dropped it earlier but snape's black eyes were darting from the egg in filch's arms to the map in moodys hand, and harry could tell he was putting two and two together, as only snape could
	potter, he said quietly
	what's that said moody calmly, folding up the map and pocketing it
	potter snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared right at the place where harry was, as though he could suddenly see him
	that egg is potters egg
	that piece of parchment belongs to potter
	i have seen it before, i recognize it  potter is here  potter, in his invisibility cloaksnape stretched out his hands like a blind man and began to move up the stairs harry could have sworn his overlarge nostrils were dilating, trying to sniff harry out  trapped
	harry leaned backward, trying to avoid snapes fingertips, but any moment nowthere's nothing there, snape barked moody, but i'll be happy to tell the headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to harry pottermeaning what  snape turned again to look at moody, his hands still outstretched, inches from harry's chest
	meaning that dumbledore's very interested to know who's got it in for that boy said moody, limping nearer still to the foot of the stairs
	and so am i, snape
	the torchlight flickered across his mangled face, so that the scars, and the chunk missing fromhis nose, looked deeper and darker than ever
	snape was looking down at moody, and harry couldn't see the expression on his face
	for a moment, nobody moved or said anything
	then snape slowly lowered his hands
	i merely thought, said snape, in a voice of forced calm, that if potter was wandering around after hours again
	it's an unfortunate habit of his
	he should be stopped
	for  for his own safety
	ah, i see, said moody softly
	got potter's best interests at heart, have youthere was a pause
	snape and moody were still staring at each other, mrs
	norris gave a loud meow, still peering around filch's legs, looking for the source of harry's bubblebath smell
	i think i will go back to bed, snape said curtly
	best idea you've had all night, said moody
	now, filch, if you'll just give me that eggno  said filch, clutching the egg as though it were his firstborn son
	professor moody, this is evidence of peeves' treacheryit's the property of the champion he stole it from, said moody
	snape swept downstairs and passed moody without another word
	filch made a chirruping noise to mrs
	norris, who stared blankly at harry for a few more seconds before turning and following her master
	still breathing very fast
	harry heard snape walking away down the corridor filch handed moody the egg and disappeared from view too, muttering to mrs
	we'll see dumbledore in the morning
	tell him what peeves was up to
	harry was left staring down at moody, who placed his staff on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward him, a dull clunk on every other step
	thanks, said harry weakly
	what is this thing  said moody, drawing the marauder's map out of his pocket and unfolding it
	map of hogwarts, said harry, hoping moody was going to pull him out of the staircase soon his leg was really hurting him
	merlins beard, moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye going haywire
	quite useful, harry said
	his eyes were starting to water from the pain
	er  professor moody, d'you think you could help me  what oh yes
	moody took hold of harrys arms and pulled harrys leg came free of the trick step, and he climbed onto the one above it
	moody was still gazing at the map
	he said slowly, you didn't happen, by any chance, to see who broke into snapes office, did you  on this map, i meaner
	moodys magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map
	he looked suddenly alarmed
	you're  you're sure
	potterpositive, said harry
	well, he's not here anymore, said moody, his eye still whizzing over the map
	that's very  very interesting
	he said nothing for almost a minute, still staring at the map
	harry could tell that this news meant something to moody and very much wanted to know what it was
	he wondered whether he dared ask
	moody scared him slightly
	yet moody had just helped him avoid an awful lot of trouble
	crouch wanted to look around snapes officemoodys magical eye left the map and fixed, quivering, upon harry
	it was a penetrating glare, and harry had the impression that moody was sizing him up, wondering whether to answer or not, or how much to tell him
	potter, moody muttered finally, they say old madeye's obsessed with catching dark wizards
	but i'm nothing  nothing  compared to barty crouch
	he continued to stare at the map
	harry was burning to know more
	professor moody he said again
	could this have anything to do with
	crouch thinks there's something going on
	like what said moody sharply
	harry wondered how much he dare say
	he didn't want moody to guess that he had a source of information outside hogwarts that might lead to tricky questions about sirius
	i don't know, harry muttered, odd stuffs been happening lately, hasn't it  it's been in the daily prophet
	the dark mark at the world cup, and the death eaters and everything
	both of moody's mismatched eyes widened
	his magical eye roved back to the marauder's map
	crouch could be thinking along those lines, he said slowly
	there have been some funny rumors flying around lately  helped along by rita skeeter, of course
	it's making a lot of people nervous, i reckon
	a grim smile twisted his lopsided mouth
	oh if there's one thing i hate, he muttered, more to himself than to harry, and his magical eye was fixed on the lefthand corner of the map, its a death eater who walked free
	could moody possibly mean what harry thought he meantand now i want to ask you a question
	potter, said moody in a more businesslike tone
	harrys heart sank he had thought this was coming
	moody was going to ask where he had got this map, which was a very dubious magical object  and the story of how it had fallen into his hands incriminated not only him, but his own father, fred and george weasley, and professor lupin, their last defense against the dark arts teacher
	moody waved the map in front of harry, who braced himselfcan i borrow thisoh said harry
	he was very fond of his map, but on the other hand, he was extremely relieved that moody wasn't asking where he'd got it, and there was no doubt that he owed moody a favor
	good boy, growled moody
	i can make good use of this
	this might be exactly what i've been looking for
	right, bed, potter, come on, now
	they climbed to the top of the stairs together, moody still examining the map as though it was a treasure the like of which he had never seen before
	they walked in silence to the door of moody's office, where he stopped and looked up at harry
	you ever thought of a career as an auror, potterno, said harry, taken aback
	you want to consider it, said moody, nodding and looking at harry thoughtfully
	i'm guessing you werent just taking that egg for a walk tonight er  no, said harry, grinning
	i've been working out the clue
	moody winked at him, his magical eye going haywire again
	nothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas, potter
	see you in the morning
	he went back into his office, staring down at the marauders map again, and closed the door behind him
	harry walked slowly back to gryffindor tower, lost in thought about snape, and crouch, and what it all meant
	why was crouch pretending to be ill, if he could manage to get to hogwarts when he wanted to  what did he think snape was concealing in his officeand moody thought he
	harry, ought to be an auror  interesting idea
	harry thought, as he got quietly into his fourposter ten minutes later, the egg and the cloak now safely back in his trunk, he thought he'd like to check how scarred the rest of them were before he chose it as a career
	chapter twentysix  the second taskyou said you'd already worked out that egg clue said hermione indignantly
	keep your voice down  said harry crossly
	i just need to  sort of finetune it, all righthe, ron, and hermione were sitting at the very back of the charms class with a table to themselves
	they were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the summoning charm today  the banishing charm
	owing to the potential for nasty accidents when objects kept flying across the room
	professor flitwick had given each student a stack of cushions on which to practice, the theory being that these wouldn't hurt anyone if they went off target
	it was a good theory, but it wasn't working very well
	neville's aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room  professor flitwick, for instance
	just forget the egg for a minute, all right  harry hissed as professor flitwick went whizzing resignedly past them, landing on top of a large cabinet
	i'm trying to tell you about snape and moody
	this class was an ideal cover for a private conversation, as everyone was having far too much fun to pay them any attention
	harry had been recounting his adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour
	snape said moodys searched his office as well  ron whispered, his eyes alight with interest as he banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand it soared into the air and knocked parvati's hat off
	d'you reckon moody's here to keep an eye on snape as well as karkaroffwell, i dunno if that's what dumbledore asked him to do, but he's definitely doing it, said harry, waving his wand without paying much attention, so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk
	moody said dumbledore only lets snape stay here because he's giving him a second chance or something
	what said ron, his eyes widening, his next cushion spinning high into the air, ricocheting off the chandelier, and dropping heavily onto flitwick's desk
	maybe moody thinks snape put your name in the goblet of fireoh ron, said hermione, shaking her head sceptically, we thought snape was trying to kill harry before, and it turned out he was saving harry's life, remembershe banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they were all supposed to be aiming at
	harry looked at hermione, thinking
	it was true that snape had saved his life once, but the odd thing was, snape definitely loathed him, just as he'd loathed harry s father when they had been at school together
	snape loved taking points from harry, and had certainly never missed an opportunity to give him punishments, or even to suggest that he should be suspended from the school
	i don't care what moody says, hermione went on
	dumbledore's not stupid
	he was right to trust hagrid and professor lupin, even though loads of people wouldn't have given them jobs, so why shouldn't he be right about snape, even if snape is a bit  evil, said ron promptly
	come on, hermione, why are all these dark wizard catchers searching his office, thenwhy has mr
	crouch been pretending to be ill said hermione, ignoring ron
	its a bit funny, isn't it, that he cant manage to come to the yule ball, but he can get up here in the middle of the night when he wants toyou just don't like crouch because of that elf, winky, said ron, sending a cushion soaring into the window
	you just want to think snapes up to something, said hermione, sending her cushion zooming neatly into the box
	i just want to know what snape did with his first chance, if he's on his second one, said harry grimly, and his cushion, to his very great surprise, flew straight across the room and landed neatly on top of hermione's
	obedient to sirius's wish of hearing about anything odd at hogwarts, harry sent him a letter by brown owl that night, explaining all about mr
	crouch breaking into snape s office, and moody and snape's conversation
	then harry turned his attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing him how to survive underwater for an hour on the twentyfourth of february
	ron quite liked the idea of using the summoning charm again  harry had explained about aqualungs, and ron couldn't see why harry shouldn't summon one from the nearest muggle town
	hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that, in the unlikely event that harry managed to learn how to operate an aqualung within the set limit of an hour, he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the international code of wizarding secrecy  it was too much to hope that no muggles would spot an aqualung zooming across the countryside to hogwarts
	of course, the ideal solution would be for you to transfigure yourself into a submarine or something, hermione said
	if only we'd done human transfiguration already  but i don't think we start that until sixth year, and it can go badly wrong if you don't know what you're doing
	yeah, i don't fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head, said harry
	i s'pose i could always attack someone in front of moody he might do it for me
	i don't think he'd let you choose what you wanted to be turned into, though, said hermione seriously
	no, i think your best chance is some sort of charm
	so harry, thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to last him a lifetime, buried himself once more among the dusty volumes, looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen
	however, though he, ron, and hermione searched through their lunchtimes, evenings, and whole weekends  though harry asked professor mcgonagall for a note of permission to use the restricted section, and even asked the irritable, vulturelike librarian
	madam pince, for help  they found nothing whatsoever that would enable harry to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale
	familiar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb harry now, and he was finding it difficult to concentrate in class again
	the lake, which harry had always taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds, drew his eyes whenever he was near a classroom window, a great, irongray mass of chilly water, whose dark and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon
	just as it had before he faced the horntail, time was slipping away as though somebody had bewitched the clocks to go extrafast
	there was a week to go before february the twentyfourth there was still time
	there were five days to go he was bound to find something soon
	three days to go please let me find something
	harry started to go off food again
	the only good thing about breakfast on monday was the return of the brown owl he had sent to sirius
	he pulled off the parchment, unrolled it, and saw the shortest letter sirius had ever written to him
	send date of next hogsmeade weekend by return owl
	harry turned the parchment over and looked at the back, hoping to see something else, but it was blank
	weekend after next, whispered hermione, who had read the note over harrys shoulder
	here  take my quill and send this owl back straight away
	harry scribbled the dates down on the back of sirius's letter, tied it onto the brown owl's leg, and watched it take flight again
	what had he expected  advice on how to survive underwater  he had been so intent on telling sirius all about snape and moody he had completely forgotten to mention the eggs clue
	what's he want to know about the next hogsmeade weekend for said ron
	dunno, said harry dully
	the momentary happiness that had flared inside him at the sight of the owl had died
	care of magical creatures
	whether hagrid was trying to make up for the blastended skrewts, or because there were now only two skrewts left, or because he was trying to prove he could do anything that professor grubblyplank could
	harry didnt know, but hagrid had been continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since he'd returned to work
	it turned out that hagrid knew quite as much about unicorns as he did about monsters, though it was clear that he found their lack of poisonous fangs disappointing
	today he had managed to capture two unicorn foals
	unlike fullgrown unicorns, they were pure gold
	parvati and lavender went into transports of delight at the sight of them, and even pansy parkinson had to work hard to conceal how much she liked them
	easier ter spot than the adults, hagrid told the class
	they turn silver when they're abou' two years old, an' they grow horns at aroun four
	don' go pure white till they're full grown, 'round about seven
	they're a bit more trustin when they're babies
	don mind boys so much
	c'mon, move in a bit, yeh can pat 'em if yeh want
	give 'em a few o' these sugar lumps
	harry  hagrid muttered, moving aside slightly, while most of the others swarmed around the baby unicorns
	jus' nervous, eh  said hagrid
	harry, said hagrid, clapping a massive hand on his shoulder, so that harry's knees buckled under its weight, i'd've bin worried before i saw yeh take on tha horntail, but i know now yeh can do anythin' yeh set yer mind ter
	i'm not worried at all
	yeh're goin ter be fine
	got yer clue worked out, haven' yehharry nodded, but even as he did so, an insane urge to confess that he didn't have any idea how to survive at the bottom of the lake for an hour came over him
	he looked up at hagrid  perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes, to deal with the creatures in it  he looked after everything else on the grounds, after allyeh're goin' ter win, hagrid growled, patting harrys shoulder again, so that harry actually felt himself sink a couple of inches into the soft ground
	yeh're goin' ter win, harry nharry just couldn't bring himself to wipe the happy, confident smile off hagrid's face
	pretending he was interested in the young unicorns, he forced a smile in return, and moved forward to pat them with the others
	by the evening before the second task
	harry felt as though he were trapped in a nightmare
	he was fully aware that even if, by some miracle, he managed to find a suitable spell, he'd have a real job mastering it overnight
	how could he have let this happen  why hadn't he got to work on the egg's clue sooner  why had he ever let his mind wander in class  what if a teacher had once mentioned how to breathe underwaterhe sat with hermione and ron in the library as the sun set outside, tearing feverishly through page after page of spells, hidden from one another by the massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them
	harry s heart gave a huge leap every time he saw the word water on a page, but more often than not it was merely take two pints of water, half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves, and a newt
	i don't reckon it can be done, said rons voice flatly from the other side of the table
	closest was that thing to dry up puddles and ponds, that drought charm, but that was nowhere near powerful enough to drain the lake
	there must be something, hermione muttered, moving a candle closer to her
	her eyes were so tired she was poring over the tiny print of olde and forgotten bewitchments and charmes with her nose about an inch from the page
	they'd never have set a task that was undoable
	harry, just go down to the lake tomorrow, right, stick your head in, yell at the merpeople to give back whatever they've nicked, and see if they chuck it out
	best you can do, mate
	there's a way of doing it  hermione said crossly
	there just has to beshe seemed to be taking the library's lack of useful information on the subject as a personal insult it had never failed her before
	i know what i should have done, said harry, resting, facedown, on saucy tricks for tricky sorts
	i should've learned to be an animagus like sirius
	an animagus was a wizard who could transform into an animal
	yeah, you could've turned into a goldfish any time you wanted  said ron
	or a frog, yawned harry
	it takes years to become an animagus, and then you have to register yourself and everything, said hermione vaguely, now squinting down the index of weird wizarding dilemmas and their solutions
	professor mcgonagall told us, remember
	you've got to register yourself with the improper use of magic office
	what animal you become, and your markings, so you can't abuse it
	hermione, i was joking, said harry wearily
	i know i haven't got a chance of turning into a frog by tomorrow morning
	oh this is no use, hermione said, snapping shut weird wizarding dilemmas
	who on earth wants to make their nose hair grow into ringletsi wouldn't mind, said fred weasleys voice
	be a talking point, wouldn't itharry, ron, and hermione looked up
	fred and george had just emerged from behind some bookshelves
	what're you two doing here ron asked
	looking for you, said george
	mcgonagall wants you, ron
	why  said hermione, looking surprised
	she was looking a bit grim, though, said fred
	we're supposed to take you down to her office, said george
	ron and hermione stared at harry, who felt his stomach drop
	was professor mcgonagall about to tell ron and hermione off  perhaps she'd noticed how much they were helping him, when he ought to be working out how to do the task alonewe'll meet you back in the common room, hermione told harry as she got up to go with ron  both of them looked very anxious
	bring as many of these books as you can, okayright, said harry uneasily
	madam pince had extinguished all the lamps and came to chivvy harry out of the library
	staggering under the weight of as many books as he could carry, harry returned to the gryffindor common room, pulled a table into a corner, and continued to search
	there was nothing in madcap magic for wacky warlocks
	nothing in a guide to medieval sorcery
	not one mention of underwater exploits in an anthology of eighteenthcentury charms, or in dreadful denizens of the deep, or powers you never knew you had and what to do with them now youve wised up
	crookshanks crawled into harrys lap and curled up, purring deeply
	the common room emptied slowly around harry
	people kept wishing him luck for the next morning in cheery, confident voices like hagrid s, all of them apparently convinced that he was about to pull off another stunning performance like the one he had managed in the first task
	harry couldn't answer them, he just nodded, feeling as though there were a golfball stuck in his throat
	by ten to midnight, he was alone in the room with crookshanks
	he had searched all the remaining books, and ron and hermione had not come back
	it's over, he told himself
	you'll just have to go down to the lake in the morning and tell the judges
	he imagined himself explaining that he couldn't do the task
	he pictured bagman's look of roundeyed surprise, karkaroffs satisfied, yellowtoothed smile
	he could almost hear fleur delacour saying i knew it
	'e is too young, 'e is only a little boy
	he saw malfoy flashing his potter stinks badge at the front of the crowd, saw hagrid s crestfallen, disbelieving face
	forgetting that crookshanks was on his lap
	harry stood up very suddenly crookshanks hissed angrily as he landed on the floor, gave harry a disgusted look, and stalked away with his bottlebrush tail in the air, but harry was already hurrying up the spiral staircase to his dormitory
	he would grab the invisibility cloak and go back to the library, he'd stay there all night if he had to
	lumos, harry whispered fifteen minutes later as he opened the library door
	wand tip alight, he crept along the bookshelves, pulling down more books  books of hexes and charms, books on merpeople and water monsters, books on famous witches and wizards, on magical inventions, on anything at all that might include one passing reference to underwater survival
	he carried them over to a table, then set to work, searching them by the narrow beam of his wand, occasionally checking his watch
	the only way he could keep going was to tell himself, over and over again, next book
	the mermaid in the painting in the prefects' bathroom was laughing
	harry was bobbing like a cork in bubbly water next to her rock, while she held his firebolt over his head
	come and get it she giggled maliciously
	come on, jumpi can't, harry panted, snatching at the firebolt, and struggling not to sink
	give it to mebut she just poked him painfully in the side with the end of the broomstick, laughing at him
	that hurts  get off ouch harry potter must wake up, sirstop poking me dobby must poke harry potter, sir, he must wake upharry opened his eyes
	he was still in the library the invisibility cloak had slipped off his head as he'd slept, and the side of his face was stuck to the pages of where there's a wand, there's a way
	he sat up, straightening his glasses, blinking in the bright daylight
	harry potter needs to hurry  squeaked dobby
	the second task starts in ten minutes, and harry potter ten minutes harry croaked
	ten  ten minuteshe looked down at his watch
	it was twenty past nine
	a large, dead weight seemed to fall through harry's chest into his stomach
	hurry, harry potter squeaked dobby, plucking at harry's sleeve
	you is supposed to be down by the lake with the other champions, sirit's too late, dobby, harry said hopelessly
	i'm not doing the task, i don't know howharry potter will do the task  squeaked the elf
	dobby knew harry had not found the right book, so dobby did it for himwhat  said harry
	but you don't know what the second task is dobby knows, sir  harry potter has to go into the lake and find his wheezy find my what and take his wheezy back from the merpeoplewhat's a wheezyyour wheezy, sir, your wheezywheezy who is giving dobby his sweaterdobby plucked at the shrunken maroon sweater he was now wearing over his shorts
	they've got ronthe thing harry potter will miss most, sir squeaked dobby
	'but past an hour' 'the prospect's black,' harry recited, staring, horrorstruck, at the elf
	'too late, it's gone, it won't come back
	'  dobby  what've i got to doyou has to eat this, sir s queaked the elf, and he put his hand in the pocket of his shorts and drew out a ball of what looked like slimy, grayishgreen rat tails
	right before you go into the lake, sir  gillyweedwhat's it do said harry, staring at the gillyweed
	it will make harry potter breathe underwater, sirdobby, said harry frantically, listen  are you sure about thishe couldn't quite forget that the last time dobby had tried to help him, he had ended up with no bones in his right arm
	dobby is quite sure, sir  said the elf earnestly
	dobby hears things, sir, he is a houseelf, he goes all over the castle as he lights the fires and mops the floors
	dobby heard professor mcgonagall and professor moody in the staffroom, talking about the next task
	dobby cannot let harry potter lose his wheezyharrys doubts vanished
	jumping to his feet he pulled off the invisibility cloak, stuffed it into his bag, grabbed the gillyweed, and put it into his pocket, then tore out of the library with dobby at his heels
	dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir  dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor
	dobby will be missed  good luck, harry potter, sir, good lucksee you later, dobby  harry shouted, and he sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs, three at a time
	the entrance hall contained a few lastminute stragglers, all leaving the great hall after breakfast and heading through the double oak doors to watch the second task
	they stared as harry flashed past, sending colin and dennis creevey flying as he leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright, chilly grounds
	as he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats that had encircled the dragons' enclosure in november were now ranged along the opposite bank, rising in stands that were packed to the bursting point and reflected in the lake below
	the excited babble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water as harry ran flatout around the other side of the lake toward the judges, who were sitting at another golddraped table at the water's edge
	cedric, fleur, and krum were beside the judges' table, watching harry sprint toward them
	harry panted, skidding to a halt in the mud and accidentally splattering fleurs robes
	where have you been said a bossy, disapproving voice
	the task's about to startharry looked around
	percy weasley was sitting at the judges' table  mr
	crouch had failed to turn up again
	now, now, percy  said ludo bagman, who was looking intensely relieved to see harry
	let him catch his breathdumbledore smiled at harry, but karkaroff and madame maxime didn't look at all pleased to see him
	it was obvious from the looks on their faces that they had thought he wasn't going to turn up
	harry bent over, hands on his knees, gasping for breath he had a stitch in his side that felt as though he had a knife between his ribs, but there was no time to get rid of it ludo bagman was now moving among the champions, spacing them along the bank at intervals of ten feet
	harry was on the very end of the line, next to krum, who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding his wand ready
	harry  bagman whispered as he moved harry a few feet farther away from krum
	know what you're going to doyeah, harry panted, massaging his ribs
	bagman gave harry's shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges' table he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done at the world cup, said, sonorus and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands
	well, all our champions are ready for the second task, which will start on my whistle
	they have precisely an hour to recover what has been taken from them
	on the count of three, then
	threethe whistle echoed shrilly in the cold, still air the stands erupted with cheers and applause without looking to see what the other champions were doing, harry pulled off his shoes and socks, pulled the handful of gillyweed out of his pocket, stuffed it into his mouth, and waded out into the lake
	it was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as though this were fire, not icy water
	his sodden robes weighed him down as he walked in deeper now the water was over his knees, and his rapidly numbing feet were slipping over silt and flat, slimy stones
	he was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he could it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery, like octopus tentacles
	waistdeep in the freezing water he stopped, swallowed, and waited for something to happen
	he could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he must look stupid, walking into the lake without showing any sign of magical power
	the part of him that was still dry was covered in goose pimples half immersed in the icy water, a cruel breeze lifting his hair, harry started to shiver violently
	he avoided looking at the stands the laughter was becoming louder, and there were catcalls and jeering from the slytherins
	then, quite suddenly, harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been pressed over his mouth and nose
	he tried to draw breath, but it made his head spin his lungs were empty, and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of his neck harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below his ears, flapping in the cold air
	without pausing to think, he did the only thing that made sense  he flung himself forward into the water
	the first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life
	his head had stopped spinning he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain
	he stretched out his hands in front of him and stared at them
	they looked green and ghostly under the water, and they had become webbed
	he twisted around and looked at his bare feet  they had become elongated and the toes were webbed tooit looked as though he had sprouted flippers
	the water didn't feel icy anymore either
	on the contrary, he felt pleasantly cool and very light
	harry struck out once more, marveling at how far and fast his flipperlike feet propelled him through the vater, and noticing how clearly he could see, and how he no longer seemed to need to blink
	he had soon swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see the bottom
	he flipped over and dived into its depths
	silence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange, dark, foggy landscape
	he could only see ten feet around him, so that as he sped throuugh the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the incoming darkness  forests of rippling, tangled black weed, wide plains of mud littered with dull, glimmering stones
	he swam deeper and deeper, out toward the middle of the lake, his eyes wide, staring through the eerily graylit water around him to the shadow beyond, where the water became opaque
	small fish flickered past him like silver darts
	once or twice he thought he saw something larger moving ahead of him, but when he got nearer, he discovered it to be nothing but a large, blackened log, or a dense clump of weed
	there was no sign of any of the other champions, merpeople, ron  nor, thankfully, the giant squid
	light green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see, two feet deep, like a meadow of very overgrown grass
	harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him, trying to discern shapes through the gloom
	and then, without warning, something grabbed hold of his ankle
	harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a small, horned water demon, poking out of the weed, its long fingers clutched tightly around harry's leg, its pointed fangs bared  harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand
	by the time he had grasped it, two more grindylows had risen out of the weed, had seized handfuls of harry's robes, and were attempting to drag him down
	relashio  harry shouted, except that no sound came out
	a large bubble issued from his mouth, and his wand, instead of sending sparks at the grindylows, pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water, for where it struck them, angry red patches appeared on their green skin
	harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylows grip and swam, as fast as he could, occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random every now and then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again, and he kicked out, hard finally, he felt his foot connect with a horned skull, and looking back, saw the dazed grindylow floating away, crosseyed, while its fellows shook their fists at harry and sank back into the weed
	harry slowed down a little, slipped his wand back inside his robes, and looked around, listening again
	he turned full circle in the water, the silence pressing harder than ever against his eardrums
	he knew he must be even deeper in the lake now, but nothing was moving but the rippling weed
	how are you getting onharry thought he was having a heart attack
	he whipped around and saw moaning myrtle floating hazily in front of him, gazing at him through her thick, pearly glasses
	myrtle harry tried to shout  but once again, nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble
	moaning myrtle actually giggled
	you want to try over there she said, pointing
	i won't come with you
	i don't like them much, they always chase me when i get too close
	harry gave her the thumbsup to show his thanks and set off once more, careful to swim a bit higher over the weed to avoid any more grindylows that might be lurking there
	he swam on for what felt like at least twenty minutes
	he was passing over vast expanses of black mud now, which swirled murkily as he disturbed the water
	then, at long last, he heard a snatch of haunting mersong
	an hour long you'll have to look, and to recover what we took
	harry swam faster and soon saw a large rock emerge out of the muddy water ahead
	it had paintings of merpeople on it they were carrying spears and chasing what looked like the giant squid
	harry swam on past the rock, following the mersong
	your time's half gone, so tarry not lest what you seek stays here to rot
	a cluster of crude stone dwellings stained with algae loomed suddenly out of the gloom on all sides
	here and there at the dark windows, harry saw faces
	faces that bore no resemblance at all to the painting of the mermaid in the prefects' bathroom
	the merpeople had grayish skin and long, wild, dark green hair
	their eyes were yellow, as were their broken teeth, and they wore thick ropes of pebbles around their necks
	they leered at harry as he swam past one or two of them emerged from their caves to watch him better, their powerful, silver fish tails beating the water, spears clutched in their hands
	harry sped on, staring around, and soon the dwellings became more numerous there were gardens of weed around some of them, and he even saw a pet grindylow tied to a stake outside one door
	merpeople were emerging on all sides now, watching him eagerly, pointing at his webbed hands and gills, talking behind their hands to one another
	harry sped around a corner and a very strange sight met his eyes
	a whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the houses that lined what looked like a merversion of a village square
	a choir of merpeople was singing in the middle, calling the champions toward them, and behind them rose a crude sort of statue a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder
	four people were bound tightly to the tail of the stone merperson
	ron was tied between hermione and cho chang
	there was also a girl who looked no older than eight, whose clouds of silvery hair made harry feel sure that she was fleur delacour's sister
	all four of them appeared to be in a very deep sleep
	their heads were lolling onto their shoulders, and fine streams of bubbles kept issuing from their mouths
	harry sped toward the hostages, half expecting the merpeople to lower their spears and charge at him, but they did nothing
	the ropes of weed tying the hostages to the statue were thick, slimy, and very strong
	for a fleeting second he thought of the knife sirius had bought him for christmas  locked in his trunk in the castle a quarter of a mile away, no use to him whatsoever
	many of the merpeople surrounding them were carrying spears
	he swam swiftly toward a sevenfoottall merman with a long green beard and a choker of shark fangs and tried to mime a request to borrow the spear
	the merman laughed and shook his head
	we do not help, he said in a harsh, croaky voice
	come on  harry said fiercely but only bubbles issued from his mouth, and he tried to pull the spear away from the merman, but the merman yanked it back, still shaking his head and laughing
	harry swirled around, staring about
	there were rocks littering the lake bottom
	he dived and snatched up a particularly jagged one and returned to the statue
	he began to hack at the ropes binding ron, and after several minutes' hard work, they broke apart
	ron floated, unconscious, a few inches above the lake bottom, drifting a little in the ebb of the water
	there was no sign of any of the other champions
	what were they playing at  why didn't they hurry up  he turned back to hermione, raised the jagged rock, and began to hack at her bindings too at once, several pairs of strong gray hands seized him
	half a dozen mermen were pulling him away from hermione, shaking their greenhaired heads, and laughing
	you take your own hostage, one of them said to him
	no way said harry furiously  but only two large bubbles came out
	your task is to retrieve your own friend
	she's my friend too harry yelled, gesturing toward hermione, an enormous silver bubble emerging soundlessly from his lips
	and i don't want them to die eithercho's head was on hermiones shoulder the small silverhaired girl was ghostly green and pale
	harry struggled to fight off the mermen, but they laughed harder than ever, holding him back
	harry looked wildly around
	where were the other champions  would he have time to take ron to the surface and come back down for hermione and the others  would he be able to find them again  he looked down at his watch to see how much time was left  it had stopped working
	but then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly over his head
	harry looked up and saw cedric swimming toward them
	there was an enormous bubble around his head, which made his features look oddly wide and stretched
	got lost he mouthed, looking panicstricken
	fleur and krum're coming nowfeeling enormously relieved, harry watched cedric pull a knife out of his pocket and cut cho free
	he pulled her upward and out of sight
	harry looked around, waiting
	where were fleur and krum  time was getting short, and according to the song, the hostages would be lost after an hour
	the merpeople started screeching animatedly
	those holding harry loosened their grip, staring behind them
	harry turned and saw something monstrous cutting through the water toward them  a human body in swimming trunks with the head of a shark
	he appeared to have transfigured himself but badly
	the sharkman swam straight to hermione and began snapping and biting at her ropes the trouble was that krum's new teeth were positioned very awkwardly for biting anything smaller than a dolphin, and harry was quite sure that if krum wasn't careful, he was going to rip hermione in half
	harry hit krum hard on the shoulder and held up the jagged stone
	krum seized it and began to cut hermione free
	within seconds, he had done it he grabbed hermione around the waist, and without a backward glance, began to rise rapidly with her toward the surface
	now what harry thought desperately
	if he could be sure that fleur was coming
	there was nothing to be done except
	he snatched up the stone, which krum had dropped, but the mermen now closed in around ron and the little girl, shaking their heads at him
	harry pulled out his wand
	get out of the wayonly bubbles flew out of his mouth, but he had the distinct impression that the mermen had understood him, because they suddenly stopped laughing
	their yellowish eyes were fixed upon harry's wand, and they looked scared
	there might be a lot more of them than there were of him, but harry could tell, by the looks on their faces, that they knew no more magic than the giant squid did
	you've got until three  harry shouted a great stream of bubbles burst from him, but he held up three fingers to make sure they got the message
	he put down a finger two
	he put down a second one they scattered
	harry darted forward and began to hack at the ropes binding the small girl to the statue, and at last she was free
	he seized the little girl around the waist, grabbed the neck of rons robes, and kicked off from the bottom
	it was very slow work
	he could no longer use his webbed hands to propel himself forward he worked his flippers furiously, but ron and fleur's sister were like potatofilled sacks dragging him back down
	he fixed his eyes skyward, though he knew he must still be very deep, the water above him was so dark,
	merpeople were rising with him
	he could see them swirling around him with ease, watching him struggle through the water
	would they pull him back down to the depths when the time was up  did they perhaps eat humans  harry's legs were seizing up with the effort to keep swimming his shoulders were aching horribly with the effort of dragging ron and the girl
	he was drawing breath with extreme difficulty
	he could feel pain on the sides of his neck again
	he was becoming very aware of how wet the water was in his mouth
	yet the darkness was definitely thinning now
	he could see daylight above him
	he kicked hard with his flippers and discovered that they were nothing more than feet
	water was flooding through his mouth into his lungs
	he was starting to feel dizzy, but he knew light and air were only ten feet above him
	he had to get there
	harry kicked his legs so hard and fast it felt as though his muscles were screaming in protest his very brain felt waterlogged, he couldn't breathe, he needed oxygen, he had to keep going, he could not stop and then he felt his head break the surface of the lake wonderful, cold, clear air was making his wet face sting he gulped it down, feeling as though he had never breathed properly before, and, panting, pulled ron and the little girl up with him
	all around him, wild, greenhaired heads were emerging out of the water with him, but they were smiling at him
	the crowd in the stands was making a great deal of noise shouting and screaming, they all seemed to be on their feet harry had the impression they thought that ron and the little girl might be dead, but they were wrong
	both of them had opened their eyes the girl looked scared and confused, but ron merely expelled a great spout of water, blinked in the bright light, turned to harry, and said, wet, this, isn't it  then he spotted fleur's sister
	what did you bring her forfleur didn't turn up, i couldn't leave her, harry panted
	harry, you prat, said ron, you didn't take that song thing seriously, did you dumbledore wouldn't have let any of us drownthe song said it was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit  said ron
	i hope you didn't waste time down there acting the heroharry felt both stupid and annoyed
	it was all very well for ron he'd been asleep, he hadn't felt how eerie it was down in the lake, surrounded by spearcarrying merpeople who'd looked more than capable of murder
	c'mon, harry said shortly, help me with her, i don't think she can swim very well
	they pulled fleur's sister through the water, back toward the bank where the judges stood watching, twenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of honor, singing their horrible screechy songs
	harry could see madam pomfrey fussing over hermione, krum, cedric, and cho, all of whom were wrapped in thick blankets
	dumbledore and ludo bagman stood beaming at harry and ron from the bank as they swam nearer, but percy, who looked very white and somehow much younger than usual, came splashing out to meet them
	meanwhile madame maxime was trying to restrain fleur delacour, who was quite hysterical, fighting tooth and nail to return to the water
	gabrielle  gabrielle  is she alive  is she 'urtshe's fine harry tried to tell her, but he was so exhausted he could hardly talk, let alone shout
	percy seized ron and was dragging him back to the bank gerroff, percy, i'm all right dumbledore and bagman were pulling harry upright fleur had broken free of madame maxime and was hugging her sister
	it was ze grindylows
	oh gabrielle, i thought
	come here, you, said madam pomfrey
	she seized harry and pulled him over to hermione and the others, wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket, and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat
	steam gushed out of his ears
	harry, well done hermione cried
	you did it, you found out how all by yourselfwell  said harry
	he would have told her about dobby, but he had just noticed karkaroff watching him
	he was the only judge who had not left the table the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that harry, ron, and fleur's sister had got back safely
	yeah, that's right, said harry, raising his voice slightly so that karkaroff could hear him
	you haff a water beetle in your hair, hermownninny, said krum
	harry had the impression that krum was drawing her attention back onto himself perhaps to remind her that he had just rescued her from the lake, but hermione brushed away the beetle impatiently and said, you're well outside the time limit, though, harry
	did it take you ages to find usno
	harry's feeling of stupidity was growing
	now he was out of the water, it seemed perfectly clear that dumbledores safety precautions wouldn't have permitted the death of a hostage just because their champion hadn't turned up
	why hadn't he just grabbed ron and gone  he would have been first back
	cedric and krum hadn't wasted time worrying about anyone else they hadn't taken the mersong seriously
	dumbledore was crouching at the water's edge, deep in conversation with what seemed to be the chief merperson, a particularly wild and ferociouslooking female
	he was making the same sort of screechy noises that the merpeople made when they were above water clearly, dumbledore could speak mermish
	finally he straightened up, turned to his fellow judges, and said, a conference before we give the marks, i think
	the judges went into a huddle
	madam pomfrey had gone to rescue ron from percy's clutches she led him over to harry and the others, gave him a blanket and some pepperup potion, then went to fetch fleur and her sister
	fleur had many cuts on her face and arms and her robes were torn, but she didn't seem to care, nor would she allow madam pomfrey to clean them
	look after gabrielle, she told her, and then she turned to harry
	you saved 'er, she said breathlessly
	even though she was not your 'ostage
	yeah, said harry, who was now heartily wishing he'd left all three girls tied to the statue
	fleur bent down, kissed harry twice on each cheek he felt his face burn and wouldn't have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again, then said to ron, and you tooyou 'elped yeah, said ron, looking extremely hopeful, yeah, a bit fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him
	hermione looked simply furious, but just then, ludo bagman's magically magnified voice boomed out beside them, making them all jump, and causing the crowd in the stands to go very quiet
	ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our decision
	merchieftainess murcus has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake, and we have therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions, as follows
	fleur delacour, though she demonstrated excellent use of the bubblehead charm, was attacked by grindylows as she approached her goal, and failed to retrieve her hostage
	we award her twentyfive points
	applause from the stands
	i deserved zero, said fleur throatily, shaking her magnificent head
	cedric diggory, who also used the bubblehead charm, was first to return with his hostage, though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour
	enormous cheers from the hufflepuffs in the crowd harry saw cho give cedric a glowing look
	we therefore award him fortyseven points
	if cedric had been outside the time limit, he most certainly had been
	viktor krum used an incomplete form of transfiguration, which was nevertheless effective, and was second to return with his hostage
	we award him forty points
	karkaroff clapped particularly hard, looking very superior
	harry potter used gillyweed to great effect, bagman continued
	he returned last, and well outside the time limit of an hour
	however, the merchieftainess informs us that mr
	potter was first to reach the hostages, and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety, not merely his own
	ron and hermione both gave harry halfexasperated, halfcommiserating looks
	most of the judges, and here, bagman gave karkaroff a very nasty look, feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks
	potter's score is fortyfive points
	harry's stomach leapt  he was now tying for first place with cedric
	ron and hermione, caught by surprise, stared at harry, then laughed and started applauding hard with the rest of the crowd
	harry ron shouted over the noise
	you weren't being thick after all  you were showing moral fiberfleur was clapping very hard too, but krum didn't look happy at all
	he attempted to engage hermione in conversation again, but she was too busy cheering harry to listen
	the third and final task will take place at dusk on the twentyfourth of june, continued bagman
	the champions will be notified of what is coming precisely one month beforehand
	thank you all for your support of the champions
	harry thought dazedly, as madam pomfrey began herding the champions and hostages back to the castle to get into dry clothes
	it was over, he had got through
	he didn't have to worry about anything now until june the twentyfourth
	next time he was in hogsmeade, harry decided as he walked back up the stone steps into the castle, he was going to buy dobby a pair of socks for every day of the year
	chapter twentyseven  padfoot returnsone of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake, which meant that ron was getting to share harry's limelight for once
	harry noticed that ron's version of events changed subtly with every retelling
	at first, he gave what seemed to be the truth it tallied with hermione's story, anyway  dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in professor mcgonagall's office, first assuring them that they would be quite safe, and would awake when they were back above the water
	one week later, however, ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he struggled singlehandedly against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him into submission before tying him up
	but i had my wand hidden up my sleeve, he assured padma patil, who seemed to be a lot keener on ron now that he was getting so much attention and was making a point of talking to him every time they passed in the corridors
	i could've taken those meridiots any time i wanted
	what were you going to do, snore at them  said hermione waspishly
	people had been teasing her so much about being the thing that viktor krum would most miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood
	ron's ears went red, and thereafter, he reverted to the bewitched sleep version of events
	as they entered march the weather became drier, but cruel winds skinned their hands and faces every time they went out onto the grounds
	there were delays in the post because the owls kept being blown off course
	the brown owl that harry had sent to sirius with the dates of the hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way harry had no sooner torn off sirius's reply than it took flight, clearly afraid it was going to be sent outside again
	sirius's letter was almost as short as the previous one
	be at stile at end of road out of hogsmeade past dervish and banges at two o'clock on saturday afternoon
	bring as much food as you can
	he hasn't come back to hogsmeade said ron incredulously
	it looks like it, doesn't it said hermione
	i can't believe him, said harry tensely, if he's caught
	made it so far, though, hasn't he said ron
	and it's not like the place is swarming with dementors anymore
	harry folded up the letter, thinking
	if he was honest with himself, he really wanted to see sirius again
	he therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon  double potions  feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually did when descending the steps to the dungeons
	malfoy, crabbe, and goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with pansy parkinson's gang of slytherin girls
	all of them were looking at something harry couldn't see and sniggering heartily
	pansys puglike face peered excitedly around goyle's broad back as harry, ron, and hermione approached
	there they are, there they are  she giggled, and the knot of slytherins broke apart
	harry saw that pansy had a magazine in her hands  witch weekly
	the moving picture on the front showed a curlyhaired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand
	you might find something to interest you in there, granger pansy said loudly, and she threw the magazine at hermione, who caught it, looking startled
	at that moment, the dungeon door opened, and snape beckoned them all inside
	hermione, harry, and ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual
	once snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of todays potion on the blackboard, hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk
	at last, in the center pages, hermione found what they were looking for
	harry and ron leaned in closer
	a color photograph of harry headed a short piece entitledharry potter's secret heartachea boy like no other, perhaps  yet a boy suffering all the usual pangs of adolescence, writes rita skeeter
	deprived of love since the tragic demiseof his parents, fourteenyearold harry potter thought he had found solace in his steady girlfriend at hogwarts, muggleborn hermione granger
	little did he know that he would shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow in a life already littered with personal loss
	miss granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to have a taste for famous wizards that harry alone cannot satisfy
	since the arrival at hogwarts of viktor krum, bulgarian seeker and hero of the last world quidditch cup, miss granger has been toying with both boys' affections
	krum, who is openly smitten with the devious miss granger, has already invited her to visit him in bulgaria over the summer holidays, and insists that he has never felt this way about any other girl
	however, it might not be miss granger's doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys' interest
	she's really ugly, says pansy parkinson, a pretty and vivacious fourthyear student, but she'd be well up to making a love potion, she's quite brainy
	i think that's how she's doing it
	love potions are, of course, banned at hogwarts, and no doubt albus dumbledore will want to investigate these claims
	in the meantime, harry potters wellwishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart on a worthier candidate
	i told you  ron hissed at hermione as she stared down at the article
	i told you not to annoy rita skeeter  she's made you out to be some sort of of scarlet womanhermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter
	scarlet woman she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at ron
	it's what my mum calls them, ron muttered, his ears going red
	if that's the best rita can do, she's losing her touch, said hermione, still giggling, as she threw witch weekly onto the empty chair beside her
	what a pile of old rubbish
	she looked over at the slytherins, who were all watching her and harry closely across the room to see if they had been upset by the article
	hermione gave them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, harry, and ron started unpacking the ingredients they would need for their witsharpening potion
	there's something funny, though, said hermione ten minutes later, holding her pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles
	how could rita skeeter have known
	known what said ron quickly
	you haven't been mixing up love potions, have youdon't be stupid, hermione snapped, starting to pound up her beetles again
	how did she know viktor asked me to visit him over the summerhermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided ron's eyes
	what said ron, dropping his pestle with a loud clunk
	he asked me right after he'd pulled me out of the lake,hermione muttered
	after he'd got rid of his shark's head
	madam pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldn't hear, and he said, if i wasn't doing anything over the summer, would i like to and what did you say  said ron, who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl, because he was looking at hermione
	and he did say he'd never felt the same way about anyone else, hermione went on, going so red now that harry could almost feel the heat coming from her, but how could rita skeeter have heard him  she wasn't there
	or was she  maybe she has got an invisibility cloak maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task
	and what did you say ron repeated, pounding his pestle down so hard that it dented the desk
	well, i was too busy seeing whether you and harry were okay tofascinating though your social life undoubtedly is
	miss granger, said an icy voice right behind them, and all three of them jumped, i must ask you not to discuss it in my class
	ten points from gryffindor
	snape had glided over to their desk while they were talking
	the whole class was now looking around at them malfoy took the opportunity to flash potter stinks across the dungeon at harry
	reading magazines under the table as well snape added, snatching up the copy of witch weekly
	a further ten points from gryffindor
	snapes black eyes glittered as they fell on rita skeeter's article
	potter has to keep up with his press cuttings
	the dungeon rang with the slytherins' laughter, and an unpleasant smile curled snape's thin mouth
	to harry's fury, he began to read the article aloud
	'harry potter's secret heartache
	potter, what's ailing you now  'a boy like no other, perhaps
	'harry could feel his face burning
	snape was pausing at the end of every sentence to allow the slytherins a hearty laugh
	the article sounded ten times worse when read by snape
	even hermione was blushing scarlet now
	harry potter's wellwishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate
	'  how very touching, sneered snape, rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the slytherins
	well, i think i had better separate the three of you, so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives
	weasley, you stay here
	miss granger, over there, beside miss parkinson
	potter  that table in front of my desk
	furious, harry threw his ingredients and his bag into his cauldron and dragged it up to the front of the dungeon to the empty table
	snape followed, sat down at his desk and watched harry unload his cauldron
	determined not to look at snape, harry resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles, imagining each one to have snape's face
	all this press attention seems to have inflated your already overlarge head
	potter, said snape quietly, once the rest of the class had settled down again
	he knew snape was trying to provoke him he had done this before
	no doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points from gryffindor before the end of the class
	you might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you, snape went on, so quietly that no one else could hear him harry continued to pound his scarab beetles, even though he had already reduced them to a very fine powder, but i don't care how many times your picture appears in the papers
	potter, you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him
	harry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started cutting up his ginger roots
	his hands were shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his eyes down, as though he couldn't hear what snape was saying to him
	so i give you fair warning, potter, snape continued in a sorter and more dangerous voice, pintsized celebrity or not  if i catch you breaking into my office one more time i haven't been anywhere near your office  said harry angrily, forgetting his feigned deafness
	don't lie to me, snape hissed, his fathomless black eyes boring into harrys
	both come from my private stores, and i know who stole them
	harry stared back at snape, determined not to blink or to look guilty
	in truth, he hadn't stolen either of these things from snape
	hermione had taken the boomslang skin back in their second year  they had needed it for the polyjuice potion  and while snape had suspected harry at the time, he had never been able to prove it
	dobby, of course, had stolen the gillyweed
	i don't know what you're talking about, harry lied coldly
	you were out of bed on the night my office was broken into  snape hissed
	potter  now, madeye moody might have joined your fan club, but i will not tolerate your behavior  one more nighttime stroll into my office, potter, and you will payright, said harry coolly, turning back to his ginger roots
	i'll bear that in mind if i ever get the urge to go in there
	he plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes
	harry thought snape was about to pull out his wand and curse him  then he saw that snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion
	do you know what this is
	potter snape said, his eyes glittering dangerously again
	no, said harry, with complete honesty this time
	it is veritaserum  a truth potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear, said snape viciously
	now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict ministry guidelines
	but unless you watch your step, you might just find that my hand slips  he shook the crystal bottle slightly  right over your evening pumpkin juice
	then we'll find out whether you've been in my office or not
	he turned back to his ginger roots once more, picked up his knife, and started slicing them again
	he didn't like the sound of that truth potion at all, nor would he put it past snape to slip him some
	he repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his mouth if snape did it
	quite apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble  hermione and dobby for a start  there were all the other things he was concealing
	like the fact that he was in contact with sirius
	and  his insides squirmed at the thought  how he felt about cho
	he tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too, and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out of moody s book and start drinking only from a private hip flask
	there was a knock on the dungeon door
	enter, said snape in his usual voice
	the class looked around as the door opened
	professor karkaroff came in
	everyone watched him as he walked up toward snape's desk
	he was twisting his finger around his goatee and looking agitated
	we need to talk, said karkaroff abruptly when he had reached snape
	he seemed so determined that nobody should hear what he was saying that he was barely opening his lips it was as though he were a rather poor ventriloquist
	harry kept his eyes on his ginger roots, listening hard
	i'll talk to you after my lesson, karkaroff, snape muttered, but karkaroff interrupted him
	i want to talk now, while you can't slip off, severus
	you've been avoiding me
	after the lesson, snape snapped
	under the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if he'd poured out enough armadillo bile, harry sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them
	karkaroff looked extremely worried, and snape looked angry
	karkaroff hovered behind snape's desk for the rest of the double period
	he seemed intent on preventing snape from slipping away at the end of class
	keen to hear what karkaroff wanted to say, harry deliberately knocked over his bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell, which gave him an excuse to duck down behind his cauldron and mop up while the rest of the class moved noisily toward the door
	what's so urgent he heard snape hiss at karkaroff
	this, said karkaroff, and harry, peering around the edge of his cauldron, saw karkaroff pull up the lefthand sleeve of his robe and show snape something on his inner forearm
	well said karkaroff, still making every effort not to move his lips
	do you see  it's never been this clear, never since  put it away snarled snape, his black eyes sweeping the classroom
	but you must have noticed  karkaroff began in an agitated voice
	we can talk later, karkaroff  spat snape
	potter  what are you doingclearing up my armadillo bile, professor, said harry innocently, straightening up and showing snape the sodden rag he was holding
	karkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon
	he looked both worried and angry
	not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry snape, harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top speed to tell ron and hermione what he had just witnessed
	they left the castle at noon the next day to find a weak silver sun shining down upon the grounds
	the weather was milder than it had been all year, and by the time they arrived in hogsmeade, all three of them had taken off their cloaks and thrown them over their shoulders
	the food sirius had told them to bring was in harry's bag they had sneaked a dozen chicken legs, a loaf of bread, and a flask of pumpkin juice from the lunch table
	they went into gladrags wizardwear to buy a present for dobby, where they had fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find, including a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver stars, and another that screamed loudly when they became too smelly
	then, at half past one, they made their way up the high street, past dervish and banges, and out toward the edge of the village
	harry had never been in this direction before
	the winding lane was leading them out into the wild countryside around hogsmeade
	the cottages were fewer here, and their gardens larger they were walking toward the foot of the mountain in whose shadow hogsmeade lay
	then they turned a corner and saw a stile at the end of the lane
	waiting for them, its front paws on the topmost bar, was a very large, shaggy black dog, which was carrying some newspapers in its mouth and looking very familiar
	hello, sirius, said harry when they had reached him
	the black dog sniffed harry's bag eagerly, wagged its tail once, then turned and began to trot away from them across the scrubby patch of ground that rose to meet the rocky foot of the mountain
	harry, ron, and hermione climbed over the stile and followed
	sirius led them to the very foot of the mountain, where the ground was covered with boulders and rocks
	it was easy for him, with his four paws, but harry, ron, and hermione were soon out of breath
	they followed sirius higher, up onto the mountain itself
	for nearly half an hour they climbed a steep, winding, and stony path, following sirius's wagging tail, sweating in the sun, the shoulder straps of harry's bag cutting into his shoulders
	then, at last, sirius slipped out of sight, and when they reached the place where he had vanished, they saw a narrow fissure in the rock
	they squeezed into it and found themselves in a cool, dimly lit cave
	tethered at the end of it, one end of his rope around a large rock, was buckbeak the hippogriff
	half gray horse, half giant eagle, buckbeak's fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of them
	all three of them bowed low to him, and after regarding them imperiously for a moment, buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck
	harry, however, was looking at the black dog, which had just turned into his godfather
	sirius was wearing ragged gray robes the same ones he had been wearing when he had left azkaban
	his black hair was longer than it had been when he had appeared in the fire, and it was untidy and matted once more
	he looked very thin
	chicken he said hoarsely after removing the old daily prophets from his mouth and throwing them down onto the cave floor
	harry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and bread
	thanks, said sirius, opening it, grabbing a drumstick, sitting down on the cave floor, and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth
	i've been living off rats mostly
	can't steal too much food from hogsmeade i'd draw attention to myself
	he grinned up at harry, but harry returned the grin only reluctantly
	what're you doing here, sirius he said
	fulfilling my duty as godfather, said sirius, gnawing on the chicken bone in a very doglike way
	don't worry about it, i'm pretending to be a lovable stray
	he was still grinning, but seeing the anxiety in harrys face, said more seriously, i want to be on the spot
	well, let's just say things are getting fishier
	i've been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out, and by the looks of things, i'm not the only one who's getting worried
	he nodded at the yellowing daily prophets on the cave floor, and ron picked them up and unfolded them
	harry, however, continued to stare at sirius
	what if they catch you what if you're seenyou three and dumbledore are the only ones around here who know i'm an animagus, said sirius, shrugging, and continuing to devour the chicken leg
	ron nudged harry and passed him the daily prophets
	there were two  the first bore the headline mystery illness ofbartemius crouch, the second, ministry witch still missingminister of magic now personally involved
	harry scanned the story about crouch
	phrases jumped out at him hasn't been seen in public since november
	house appears deserted
	mungo's hospital for magical maladies and injuries decline comment
	ministry refuses to confirm rumors of critical illness
	they're making it sound like he's dying, said harry slowly
	but he can't be that ill if he managed to get up here
	my brothers crouch's personal assistant, ron informed sirius
	he says crouch is suffering from overwork
	mind you, he did look ill, last time i saw him up close, said harry slowly, still reading the story
	the night my name came out of the goblet
	getting his comeuppance for sacking winky, isn't he said hermione, an edge to her voice
	she was stroking buckbeak, who was crunching up sirius's chicken bones
	i bet he wishes he hadn't done it now  bet he feels the difference now she's not there to look after him
	hermione's obsessed with houseelfs, ron muttered to sirius, casting hermione a dark look
	sirius, however, looked interested
	crouch sacked his houseelfyeah, at the quidditch world cup, said harry, and he launched into the story of the dark mark's appearance, and winky being found with harrys wand clutched in her hand, and mr
	when harry had finished, sirius was on his feet again and had started pacing up and down the cave
	let me get this straight, he said after a while, brandishing a fresh chicken leg
	you first saw the elfin the top box
	she was saving crouch a seat, rightright, said harry, ron, and hermione together
	but crouch didn't turn up for the matchno, said harry
	i think he said he'd been too busy
	sirius paced all around the cave in silence
	then he said, harry, did you check your pockets for your wand after you'd left the top boxerm
	no, he said finally
	i didn't need to use it before we got in the forest
	and then i put my hand in my pocket, and all that was in there were my omnioculars
	he stared at sirius
	are you saying whoever conjured the mark stole my wand in the top boxit's possible, said sirius
	winky didn't steal that wand  hermione insisted
	the elf wasn't the only one in that box, said sirius, his brow furrowed as he continued to pace
	who else was sitting behind youloads of people, said harry
	some bulgarian ministers
	the malfoys  said ron suddenly, so loudly that his voice echoed all around the cave, and buckbeak tossed his head nervously
	i bet it was lucius malfoyanyone else said sirius
	yes, there was, there was ludo bagman, hermione reminded him
	i don't know anything about bagman except that he used to be beater for the wimbourne wasps, said sirius, still pacing
	what's he likehe's okay, said harry
	he keeps offering to help me with the triwizard tournament
	does he, now said sirius, frowning more deeply
	i wonder why he'd do thatsays he's taken a liking to me, said harry
	hmm, said sirius, looking thoughtful
	we saw him in the forest just before the dark mark appeared, hermione told sirius
	remember  she said to harry and ron
	yeah, but he didn't stay in the forest, did he  said ron
	the moment we told him about the riot, he went off to the campsite
	how d'you know  hermione shot back
	how d'you know where he disapparated tocome off it, said ron incredulously
	are you saying you reckon ludo bagman conjured the dark markit's more likely he did it than winky, said hermione stubbornly
	told you, said ron, looking meaningfully at sirius, told you she's obsessed with house but sirius held up a hand to silence ron
	when the dark mark had been conjured, and the elf had been discovered holding harry's wand, what did crouch dowent to look in the bushes, said harry, but there wasn't anyone else there
	of course, sirius muttered, pacing up and down, of course, he'd want to pin it on anyone but his own elf
	and then he sacked heryes, said hermione in a heated voice, he sacked her, just because she hadn't stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled hermione, will you give it a rest with the elf said ron
	sirius shook his head and said,  she's got the measure of crouch better than you have, ron
	if you want to know what a mans like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals
	he ran a hand over his unshaven face, evidently thinking hard
	all these absences of barty crouch's
	he goes to the trouble of making sure his houseelf saves him a seat at the quidditch world cup, but doesn't bother to turn up and watch
	he works very hard to reinstate the triwizard tournament, and then stops coming to that too
	it's not like crouch
	if he's ever taken a day off work because of illness before this, i'll eat buckbeak
	d'you know crouch, then said harry
	sirius's face darkened
	he suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when harry first met him, the night when harry still believed sirius to be a murderer
	oh i know crouch all right, he said quietly
	he was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to azkaban  without a trial
	what  said ron and hermione together
	you're kidding said harry
	no, i'm not, said sirius, taking another great bite of chicken
	crouch used to be head of the department of magical law enforcement, didn't you knowharry, ron, and hermione shook their heads
	he was tipped for the next minister of magic, said sirius
	he's a great wizard, barty crouch, powerfully magical  and powerhungry
	oh never a voldemort supporter, he said, reading the look on harrys face
	no, barty crouch was always very outspoken against the dark side
	but then a lot of people who were against the dark side
	well, you wouldn't understand
	that's what my dad said at the world cup, said ron, with a trace of irritation in his voice
	try us, why don't youa grin flashed across sirius's thin face
	all right, i'll try you
	he walked once up the cave, back again, and then said, imagine that voldemort's powerful now
	you don't know who his supporters are, you don't know who's working for him and who isn't you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves
	you're scared for yourself, and your family, and your friends
	every week, news comes of more deaths, more disappearances, more torturing
	the ministry of magic's in disarray, they don't know what to do, they're trying to keep everything hidden from the muggles, but meanwhile, muggles are dying too
	that's how it used to be
	well, times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others
	crouch's principles might've been good in the beginning  i wouldn't know
	he rose quickly through the ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures against voldemorts supporters
	the aurors were given new powers  powers to kill rather than capture, for instance
	and i wasn't the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial
	crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the unforgivable curses against suspects
	i would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the dark side
	he had his supporters, mind you  plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as minister of magic
	when voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a matter of time until crouch got the top job
	but then something rather unfortunate happened
	sirius smiled grimly
	crouch's own son was caught with a group of death eaters who'd managed to talk their way out of azkaban
	apparently they were trying to find voldemort and return him to power
	crouch's son was caught  gasped hermione
	yep, said sirius, throwing his chicken bone to buckbeak, flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half
	nasty little shock for old barty, i'd imagine
	should have spent a bit more time at home with his family, shouldn't he  ought to have left the office early once in a while
	gotten to know his own son
	he began to wolf down large pieces of bread
	was his son a death eater said harry
	no idea, said sirius, still stuffing down bread
	i was in azkaban myself when he was brought in
	this is mostly stuff i've found out since i got out
	the boy was definitely caught in the company of people i'd bet my life were death eaters  but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, just like the houseelf
	did crouch try and get his son off hermione whispered
	sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark
	crouch let his son off  i thought you had the measure of him, hermione  anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go he had dedicated his whole life to becoming minister of magic
	you saw him dismiss a devoted houseelf because she associated him with the dark mark again  doesn't that tell you what he's like  crouch's fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial, and by all accounts, it wasn't much more than an excuse for crouch to show how much he hated the boy
	then he sent him straight to azkaban
	he gave his own son to the dementors asked harry quietly
	that's right, said sirius, and he didn't look remotely amused now
	i saw the dementors bringing him in, watched them through the bars in my cell door
	he can't have been more than nineteen
	they took him into a cell near mine
	he was screaming for his mother by nightfall
	he went quiet after a few days, though
	they all went quiet in the end
	except when they shrieked in their sleep
	for a moment, the deadened look in sirius's eyes became more pronounced than ever, as though shutters had closed behind them
	so he's still in azkaban harry said
	no, said sirius dully
	no, he's not in there anymore
	he died about a year after they brought him in
	he diedhe wasn't the only one, said sirius bitterly
	most go mad in there, and plenty stop eating in the end
	they lose the will to live
	you could always tell when a death was coming, because the dementors could sense it, they got excited
	that boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived
	crouch being an important ministry member, he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit
	that was the last time i saw barty crouch, half carrying his wife past my cell
	she died herself, apparently, shortly afterward
	wasted away just like the boy
	crouch never came for his sons body
	the dementors buried him outside the fortress i watched them do it
	sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and instead picked up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it
	so old crouch lost it all, just when he thought he had it made, he continued, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand
	one moment, a hero, poised to become minister of magic
	next, his son dead, his wife dead, the family name dishonored, and, so i've heard since i escaped, a big drop in popularity
	once the boy had died, people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray
	the conclusion was that his father never cared much for him
	so cornelius fudge got the top job, and crouch was shunted sideways into the department of international magical cooperation
	there was a long silence
	harry was thinking of the way crouch's eyes had bulged as he'd looked down at his disobedient houseelf back in the wood at the quidditch world cup
	this, then, must have been why crouch had overreacted to winky being found beneath the dark mark
	it had brought back memories of his son, and the old scandal, and his fall from grace at the ministry
	moody says crouch is obsessed with catching dark wizards, harry told sirius
	yeah, i've heard it's become a bit of a mania with him, said sirius, nodding
	if you ask me, he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more death eater
	and he sneaked up here to search snape's office s aid ron triumphantly, looking at hermione
	yes, and that doesn't make sense at all, said sirius
	yeah, it does  said ron excitedly, but sirius shook his head
	listen, if crouch wants to investigate snape, why hasn't he been coming to judge the tournament  it would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to hogwarts and keep an eye on him
	so you think snape could be up to something, then  asked harry, but hermione broke in
	look, i don't care what you say, dumbledore trusts snape oh give it a rest, hermione, said ron impatiently
	i know dumbledores brilliant and everything, but that doesn't mean a really clever dark wizard couldn't fool him why did snape save harry's life in the first year, then  why didn't he just let him diei dunno  maybe he thought dumbledore would kick him outwhat d'you think, sirius  harry said loudly, and ron and hermione stopped bickering to listen
	i think they've both got a point, said sirius, looking thoughtfully at ron and hermione
	ever since i found out snape was teaching here, i've wondered why dumbledore hired him
	snape's always been fascinated by the dark arts, he was famous for it at school
	slimy, oily, greasyhaired kid, he was,  sirius added, and harry and ron grinned at each other
	snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year, and he was part of a gang of slytherins who nearly all turned out to be death eaters
	sirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names
	rosier and wilkes  they were both killed by aurors the year before voldemort fell
	the lestranges  they're a married couple  they're in azkaban
	avery  from what i've heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying he'd been acting under the imperius curse  he's still at large
	but as far as i know, snape was never even accused of being a death eater  not that that means much
	plenty of them were never caught
	and snape s certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble
	snape knows karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that quiet, said ron
	yeah, you should've seen snape's face when karkaroff turned up in potions yesterday  said harry quickly
	karkaroff wanted to talk to snape, he says snape's been avoiding him
	karkaroff looked really worried
	he showed snape something on his arm, but i couldn't see what it was
	he showed snape something on his arm  said sirius, looking frankly bewildered
	he ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair, then shrugged again
	well, i've no idea what that's about
	but if karkaroff s genuinely worried, and he's going to snape for answers
	sirius stared at the cave wall, then made a grimace of frustration
	there's still the fact that dumbledore trusts snape, and i know dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people wouldn't, but i just can't see him letting snape teach at hogwarts if he'd ever worked for voldemort
	why are moody and crouch so keen to get into snapes office then  said ron stubbornly
	well, said sirius slowly, i wouldn't put it past madeye to have searched every single teacher's office when he got to hogwarts
	he takes his defense against the dark arts seriously, moody
	i'm not sure he trusts anyone at all, and after the things he's seen, it's not surprising
	i'll say this for moody, though, he never killed if he could help it
	always brought people in alive where possible
	he was tough, but he never descended to the level of the death eaters
	he's a different matter
	is he really ill  if he is, why did he make the effort to drag himself up to snape's office  and if he's not
	what's he up to  what was he doing at the world cup that was so important he didn't turn up in the top box  what's he been doing while he should have been judging the tournamentsirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave wall
	buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky floor, looking for bones he might have overlooked
	finally, sirius looked up at ron
	you say your brother s crouch's personal assistant  any chance you could ask him if he's seen crouch latelyi can try, said ron doubtfully
	better not make it sound like i reckon crouch is up to anything dodgy, though
	and you might try and find out whether they've got any leads on bertha jorkins while you're at it, said sirius, gesturing to the second copy of the daily prophet
	bagman told me they hadn't, said harry
	yes, he's quoted in the article in there, said sirius, nodding at the paper
	blustering on about how bad bertha's memory is
	well, maybe she's changed since i knew her, but the bertha i knew wasn't forgetful at all  quite the reverse
	she was a bit dim, but she had an excellent memory for gossip
	it used to get her into a lot of trouble she never knew when to keep her mouth shut
	i can see her being a bit of a liability at the ministry of magic
	maybe that's why bagman didn't bother to look for her for so long
	sirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyes
	what's the timeharry checked his watch, then remembered it hadn't been working since it had spent over an hour in the lake
	it's half past three, said hermione
	you'd better get back to school, sirius said, getting to his feet
	he looked particularly hard at harry
	i don't want you lot sneaking out of school to see me, all right  just send notes to me here
	i still want to hear about anything odd
	but you're not to go leaving hogwarts without permission it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you
	no one's tried to attack me so far, except a dragon and a couple of grindylows, harry said, but sirius scowled at him
	i'll breathe freely again when this tournament's over, and that's not until june
	and don't forget, if you're talking about me among yourselves, call me snuffles, okayhe handed harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat buckbeak goodbye
	i'll walk to the edge of the village with you, said sirius, see if i can scrounge another paper
	he transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave, and they walked back down the mountainside with him, across the boulderstrewn ground, and back to the stile
	here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head, before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village
	harry, ron, and hermione made their way back into hogsmeade and up toward hogwarts
	wonder if percy knows all that stuff about crouch  ron said as they walked up the drive to the castle
	but maybe he doesn't care
	it'd probably just make him admire crouch even more
	yeah, percy loves rules
	he'd just say crouch was refusing to break them for his own son
	percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors, said hermione severely
	i don't know, said ron
	if he thought we were standing in the way of his career
	percy's really ambitious, you know
	they walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall, where the delicious smells of dinner wafted toward them from the great hall
	poor old snuffles, said ron, breathing deeply
	he must really like you
	imagine having to live off rats
	chapter twentyeight  the madness of mr crouchharry, ron, and hermione went up to the owlery after breakfast on sunday to send a letter to percy, asking, as sirius had suggested, whether he had seen mr
	they used hedwig, because it had been so long since she'd had a job
	when they had watched her fly out of sight through the owlery window, they proceeded down to the kitchen to give dobby his new socks
	the houseelves gave them a very cheery welcome, bowing and curtsying and bustling around making tea again
	dobby was ecstatic about his present
	harry potter is too good to dobby he squeaked, wiping large tears out of his enormous eyes
	you saved my life with that gillyweed, dobby, you really did, said harry
	no chance of more of those eclairs, is there  said ron, who was looking around at the beaming and bowing houseelves
	you've just had breakfast said hermione irritably, but a great silver platter of eclairs was already zooming toward them, supported by four elves
	we should get some stuff to send up to snuffles, harry muttered
	give pig something to do
	you couldn't give us a bit of extra food, could you  he said to the surrounding elves, and they bowed delightedly and hurried off to get some more
	dobby, where's winky said hermione, who was looking around
	winky is over there by the fire, miss, said dobby quietly, his ears drooping slightly
	oh dear, said hermione as she spotted winky
	harry looked over at the fireplace too
	winky was sitting on the same stool as last time, but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not immediately distinguishable from the smokeblackened brick behind her
	her clothes were ragged and unwashed
	she was clutching a bottle of butterbeer and swaying slightly on her stool, staring into the fire
	as they watched her, she gave an enormous hiccup
	winky is getting through six bottles a day now, dobby whispered to harry
	well, it's not strong, that stuff, harry said
	but dobby shook his head
	'tis strong for a houseelf, sir, he said
	the elves who had brought the eclairs gave her disapproving looks as they returned to work
	winky is pining, harry potter, dobby whispered sadly
	winky wants to go home
	winky still thinks mr
	crouch is her master, sir, and nothing dobby says will persuade her that professor dumbledore is her master now
	hey, winky, said harry, struck by a sudden inspiration, walking over to her, and bending down, you don't know what mr
	crouch might be up to, do you  because he's stopped turning up to judge the triwizard tournament
	winky's eyes flickered
	her enormous pupils focused on harry
	she swayed slightly again and then said,  m  master is stopped  hic  comingyeah, said harry, we haven't seen him since the first task
	the daily prophet's saying he's ill
	winky swayed some more, staring blurrily at harry
	master hic illher bottom lip began to tremble
	but we're not sure if that's true, said hermione quickly
	master is needing his  hie  winky  whimpered the elf
	master cannot  hic  manage  hic  all by himself
	other people manage to do their own housework, you know, winky, hermione said severely
	winky  hic  is not only  hic  doing housework for mr
	crouch  winky squeaked indignantly, swaying worse than ever and slopping butterbeer down her already heavily stained blouse
	master is  hic  trusting winky with  hic  the most important  hic  the most secret
	but winky shook her head very hard, spilling more butterbeer down herself
	winky keeps  hic  her master's secrets, she said mutinously, swaying very heavily now, frowning up at harry with her eyes crossed
	you is  hic  nosing, you is
	winky must not talk like that to harry potter  said dobby angrily
	harry potter is brave and noble and harry potter is not nosyhe is nosing  hic  into my master's  hic  private and secret  hic  winky is a good houseelf hic  winky keeps her silence  hic  people trying to  hic  pry and poke  hic winky's eyelids drooped and suddenly, without warning, she slid off her stool into the hearth, snoring loudly
	the empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away across the stoneflagged floor
	half a dozen houseelves came hurrying forward, looking disgusted
	one of them picked up the bottle the others covered winky with a large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly, hiding her from view
	we is sorry you had to see that, sirs and miss  squeaked a nearby elf, shaking his head and looking very ashamed
	we is hoping you will not judge us all by winky, sirs and missshe's unhappy said hermione, exasperated
	why don't you try and cheer her up instead of covering her upbegging your pardon, miss, said the houseelf, bowing deeply again, but houseelves has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and masters to be served
	oh for heavens sake  hermione cried
	listen to me, all of you  you've got just as much right as wizards to be unhappy  you've got the right to wages and holidays and proper clothes, you don't have to do everything you're told  look at dobbymiss will please keep dobby out of this, dobby mumbled, looking scared
	the cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the houseelves around the kitchen
	they were suddenly looking at hermione as though she were mad and dangerous
	we has your extra food  squeaked an elf at harry's elbow, and he shoved a large ham, a dozen cakes, and some fruit into harry's arms
	goodbyethe houseelves crowded around harry, ron, and hermione and began shunting them out of the kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of their backs
	thank you for the socks, harry potter  dobby called miserably from the hearth, where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was winky
	you couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you, hermione  said ron angrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them
	they won't want us visiting them now  we could've tried to get more stuff out of winky about crouchoh as if you care about that scoffed hermione
	you only like coming down here for the foodit was an irritable sort of day after that
	harry got so tired of ron and hermione sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that he took sirius's food up to the owlery that evening on his own
	pigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire ham up to the mountain by himself, so harry enlisted the help of two school screech owls as well
	when they had set off into the dusk, looking extremely odd carrying the large package between them
	harry leaned on the windowsill, looking out at the grounds, at the dark, rustling treetops of the forbidden forest, and the rippling sails of the durmstrang ship
	an eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from hagrids chimney it soared toward the castle, around the owlery, and out of sight
	looking down, harry saw hagrid digging energetically in front of his cabin
	harry wondered what he was doing it looked as though he were making a new vegetable patch
	as he watched, madame maxime emerged from the beauxbatons carriage and walked over to hagrid
	she appeared to be trying to engage him in conversation
	hagrid leaned upon his spade, but did not seem keen to prolong their talk, because madame maxime returned to the carriage shortly afterward
	unwilling to go back to gryffindor tower and listen to ron and hermione snarling at each other, harry watched hagrid digging until the darkness swallowed him and the owls around harry began to awake, swooshing past him into the night
	by breakfast the next day ron's and hermione's bad moods had burnt out, and to harrys relief, ron's dark predictions that the houseelves would send substandard food up to the gryffindor table because hermione had insulted them proved false the bacon, eggs, and kippers were quite as good as usual
	when the post owls arrived, hermione looked up eagerly she seemed to be expecting something
	percy won't've had time to answer yet, said ron
	we only sent hedwig yesterday
	no, it's not that, said hermione
	i've taken out a subscription to the daily prophet
	i'm getting sick of finding everything out from the slytherins
	good thinking  said harry, also looking up at the owls
	hey, hermione, i think you're in luck a gray owl was soaring down toward hermione
	it hasn't got a newspaper, though, she said, looking disappointed
	it's but to her bewilderment, the gray owl landed in front of her plate, closely followed by four barn owls, a brown owl, and a tawny
	how many subscriptions did you take out said harry, seizing hermione's goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls, all of whom were jostling close to her, trying to deliver their own letter first
	what on earth   hermione said, taking the letter from the gray owl, opening it, and starting to read
	oh really she sputtered, going rather red
	it,'s  oh how ridiculous she thrust the letter at harry, who saw that it was not handwritten, but composed from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut out of the daily prophet
	you are a wicked girl
	harry potter deservesbetter
	go back where you came from muggle
	they're all like it  said hermione desperately, opening one letter after another
	'harry potter can do much better than the likes of you
	' 'you deserve to be boiled in frog spawn
	' ouchshe had opened the last envelope, and yellowishgreen liquid smelling strongly of petrol gushed over her hands, which began to erupt in large yellow boils
	undiluted bubotuber pus said ron, picking up the envelope gingerly and sniffing it
	ow  said hermione, tears starting in her eyes as she tried to rub the pus off her hands with a napkin, but her fingers were now so thickly covered in painful sores that it looked as though she were wearing a pair of thick, knobbly gloves
	you'd better get up to the hospital wing, said harry as the owls around hermione took flight
	we'll tell professor sprout where you've gone
	i warned her  said ron as hermione hurried out of the great hall, cradling her hands
	i warned her not to annoy rita skeeter  look at this one
	he read out one of the letters hermione had left behind i read in witch weekly about how you are playing harry potter false and that boy has had enough hardship and i will be sending you a curse by next post as soon as i can find a big enough envelope
	'  blimey, she'd better watch out for herself
	hermione didn't turn up for herbology
	as harry and ron left the greenhouse for their care of magical creatures class, they saw malfoy, crabbe, and goyle descending the stone steps of the castle
	pansy parkinson was whispering and giggling behind them with her gang of slytherin girls
	catching sight of harry, pansy called, potter, have you split up with your girlfriend  why was she so upset at breakfastharry ignored her he didn't want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how much trouble the witch weekly article had caused
	hagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns, was waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his feet
	harrys heart sank at the sight of the crates  surely not another skrewt hatching  but when he got near enough to see inside, he found himself looking at a number of flurry black creatures with long snouts
	their front paws were curiously flat, like spades, and they were blinking up at the class, looking politely puzzled at all the attention
	these're nifflers, said hagrid, when the class had gathered around
	yeh find 'em down mines mostly
	they like sparkly stuff
	one of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite pansy parkinson's watch off her wrist
	she shrieked and jumped backward
	useful little treasure detectors, said hagrid happily
	thought we'd have some fun with 'em today
	see over there  he pointed at the large patch of freshly turned earth harry had watched him digging from the owlery window
	i've buried some gold coins
	i've got a prize fer whoever picks the niffler that digs up most
	jus' take off all yer valuables, an' choose a niffler, an get ready ter set 'em loose
	harry took off his watch, which he was only wearing out of habit, as it didn't work anymore, and stuffed it into his pocket
	then he picked up a niffler
	it put its long snout in harry's ear and sniffed enthusiastically
	it was really quite cuddly
	hang on, said hagrid, looking down into the crate, there's a spare niffler here
	who's missin  where's hermioneshe had to go to the hospital wing, said ron
	we'll explain later, harry muttered pansy parkinson was listening
	it was easily the most fun they had ever had in care of magical creatures
	the nifflers dived in and out of the patch of earth as though it were water, each scurrying back to the student who had released it and spitting gold into their hands
	ron's was particularly efficient it had soon filled his lap with coins
	can you buy these as pets, hagrid  he asked excitedly as his niffler dived back into the soil, splattering his robes
	yer mum wouldn' be happy, ron, said hagrid, grinning
	they wreck houses, nifflers
	i reckon they've nearly got the lot, now, he added, pacing around the patch of earth while the nifflers continued to dive
	i on'y buried a hundred coins
	oh there y'are, hermionehermione was walking toward them across the lawn
	her hands were very heavily bandaged and she looked miserable
	pansy parkinson was watching her beadily
	well, let's check how yeh've done said hagrid
	count yer coins  an' there's no point tryin' ter steal any, goyle, he added, his beetleblack eyes narrowed
	it's leprechaun gold
	vanishes after a few hours
	goyle emptied his pockets, looking extremely sulky
	it turned out that ron's niffler had been most successful, so hagrid gave him an enormous slab of honeydukes chocolate for a prize
	the bell rang across the grounds for lunch the rest of the class set off back to the castle, but harry, ron, and hermione stayed behind to help hagrid put the nifflers back in their boxes
	harry noticed madame maxime watching them out other carriage window
	what yeh done ter your hands, hermione  said hagrid, looking concerned
	hermione told him about the hate mail she had received that morning, and the envelope full of bubotuber pus
	aaah, don worry, said hagrid gendy, looking down at her
	i got some o' those letters an all, after rita skeeter wrote abou me mum
	'yeh're a monster an yeh should be put down
	'  'yer mother killed innocent people an if you had any decency you d jump in a lake
	'no said hermione, looking shocked
	yeah, said hagrid, heaving the niffler crates over by his cabin wall
	they're jus' nutters, hermione
	don' open 'em if yeh get any more
	chuck 'em straigh' in the fire
	you missed a really good lesson, harry told hermione as they headed back toward the castle
	they're good, nifflers, aren't they, ronron, however, was frowning at the chocolate hagrid had given him
	he looked thoroughly put out about something
	what's the matter  said harry
	wrong flavorno, said ron shortly
	why didn't you tell me about the goldwhat gold  said harry
	the gold i gave you at the quidditch world cup, said ron
	the leprechaun gold i gave you for my omnioculars
	why didn't you tell me it disappearedharry had to think for a moment before he realized what ron was talking about
	he said, the memory coming back to him at last
	i never noticed it had gone
	i was more worried about my wand, wasn't ithey climbed the steps into the entrance hall and went into the great hall for lunch
	must be nice, ron said abruptly, when they had sat down and started serving themselves roast beef and yorkshire puddings
	to have so much money you don't notice if a pocketful of galleons goes missing
	listen, i had other stuff on my mind that night s aid harry impatiently
	we all did, rememberi didn't know leprechaun gold vanishes, ron muttered
	i thought i was paying you back
	you shouldn't've given me that chudley cannon hat for christmas
	forget it, all right  said harry
	ron speared a roast potato on the end of his fork, glaring at it
	then he said, i hate being poor
	harry and hermione looked at each other
	neither of them really knew what to say
	it's rubbish, said ron, still glaring down at his potato
	i don't blame fred and george for trying to make some extra money
	wish i had a niffler
	well, we know what to get you next christmas, said hermione brightly
	then, when ron continued to look gloomy, she said, come on, ron, it could be worse
	at least your fingers aren't full of pus
	hermione was having a lot of difficulty managing her knife and fork, her fingers were so stiff and swollen
	i hate that skeeter woman  she burst out savagely
	i'll get her back for this if it's the last thing i dohate mail continued to arrive for hermione over the following week, and although she followed hagrid's advice and stopped opening it, several of her illwishers sent howlers, which exploded at the gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the whole hall to hear
	even those people who didn't read witch weekly knew all about the supposed harrykrumhermione triangle now
	harry was getting sick of telling people that hermione wasn't his girlfriend
	it'll die down, though, he told hermione, if we just ignore it
	people got bored with that stuff she wrote about me last timei want to know how she's listening into private conversations when she's supposed to be banned from the grounds  said hermione angrily
	hermione hung back in their next defense against the dark arts lesson to ask professor moody something
	the rest of the class was very eager to leave moody had given them such a rigorous test of hexdeflection that many of them were nursing small injuries
	harry had such a bad case of twitchy ears, he had to hold his hands clamped over them as he walked away from the class
	well, rita's definitely not using an invisibility cloak  hermione panted five minutes later, catching up with harry and ron in the entrance hall and pulling harrys hand away from one of his wiggling ears so that he could hear her
	moody says he didn't see her anywhere near the judges' table at the second task, or anywhere near the lakehermione, is there any point in telling you to drop this  said ron
	no said hermione stubbornly
	i want to know how she heard me talking to viktor and how she found out about hagrids mummaybe she had you bugged,  said harry
	bugged said ron blankly
	put fleas on her or somethingharry started explaining about hidden microphones and recording equipment
	ron was fascinated, but hermione interrupted them
	aren't you two ever going to read hogwarts, a historywhat's the point  said ron
	you know it by heart, we can just ask you
	all those substitutes for magic muggles use  electricity, computers, and radar, and all those things  they all go haywire around hogwarts, there's too much magic in the air
	no, rita's using magic to eavesdrop, she must be
	if i could just find out what it is
	ooh, if it's illegal, i'll have her
	haven't we got enough to worry about  ron asked her
	do we have to start a vendetta against rita skeeter as welli'm not asking you to help  hermione snapped
	i'll do it on my ownshe marched back up the marble staircase without a backward glance
	harry was quite sure she was going to the library
	what's the betting she comes back with a box of  hate rita skeeter badges said ron
	hermione, however, did not ask harry and ron to help her pursue vengeance against rita skeeter, for which they were both grateful, because their workload was mounting ever higher in the days before the easter holidays
	harry frankly marveled at the fact that hermione could research magical methods of eavesdropping as well as everything else they had to do
	he was working flatout just to get through all their homework, though he made a point of sending regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain for sirius after last summer, harry had not forgotten what it felt like to be continually hungry
	he enclosed notes to sirius, telling him that nothing out of the ordinary had happened, and that they were still waiting for an answer from percy
	hedwig didn't return until the end of the easter holidays
	percy's letter was enclosed in a package of easter eggs that mrs
	both harrys and ron's were the size of dragon eggs and full of homemade toffee
	hermiones, however, was smaller than a chicken egg
	her face fell when she saw it
	your mum doesn't read witch weekly, by any chance, does she, ron  she asked quietly
	yeah, said ron, whose mouth was full of toffee
	gets it for the recipes
	hermione looked sadly at her tiny egg
	don't you want to see what percy's written harry asked her hastily
	percys letter was short and irritated
	as i am constantly telling the daily prophet, mr
	crouch is taking a welldeserved break
	he is sending in regular owls with instructions
	no, i haven't actually seen him, but i think i can be trusted to know my own superior's handwriting
	i have quite enough to do at the moment without trying to quash these ridiculous rumors
	please don't bother me again unless it's something important
	the start of the summer term would normally have meant that harry was training hard for the last quidditch match of the season
	this year, however, it was the third and final task in the triwizard tournament for which he needed to prepare, but he still didn't know what he would have to do
	finally, in the last week of may, professor mcgonagall held him back in transfiguration
	you are to go down to the quidditch field tonight at nine o'clock
	potter, she told him
	bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third task
	so at half past eight that night
	harry left ron and hermione in gryffindor tower and went downstairs
	as he crossed the entrance hall, cedric came up from the hufflepuff common room
	what d'you reckon it's going to be  he asked harry as they went together down the stone steps, out into the cloudy night
	fleur keeps going on about underground tunnels she reckons we've got to find treasure
	that wouldn't be too bad, said harry, thinking that he would simply ask hagrid for a niffler to do the job for him
	they walked down the dark lawn to the quidditch stadium, turned through a gap in the stands, and walked out onto the field
	what've they done to it cedric said indignantly, stopping dead
	the quidditch field was no longer smooth and flat
	it looked as though somebody had been building long, low walls all over it that twisted and crisscrossed in every direction
	they're hedges said harry, bending to examine the nearest one
	hello there called a cheery voice
	ludo bagman was standing in the middle of the field with krum and fleur
	harry and cedric made their way toward them, climbing over the hedges
	fleur beamed at harry as he came nearer
	her attitude toward him had changed completely since he had saved her sister from the lake
	well, what d'you think  said bagman happily as harry and cedric climbed over the last hedge
	growing nicely, aren't they  give them a month and hagrid'll have them twenty feet high
	don't worry, he added, grinning, spotting the lessthanhappy expressions on harrys and cedric's faces, you'll have your quidditch field back to normal once the task is over now, i imagine you can guess what we're making hereno one spoke for a moment
	then maze, grunted krum
	that's right  said bagman
	the third task's really very straightforward
	the triwizard cup will be placed in the center of the maze
	the first champion to touch it will receive full marks
	we seemply 'ave to get through the maze said fleur
	there will be obstacles, said bagman happily, bouncing on the balls of his feet
	hagrid is providing a number of creatures
	then there will be spells that must be broken
	all that sort of thing, you know
	now, the champions who are leading on points will get a head start into the maze
	bagman grinned at harry and cedric
	but you'll all be in with a fighting chance, depending how well you get past the obstacles
	should be fun, ehharry, who knew only too well the kind of creatures that hagrid was likely to provide for an event like this, thought it was unlikely to be any fun at all
	however, he nodded politely like the other champions
	if you haven't got any questions, we'll go back up to the castle, shall we, it's a bit chilly
	bagman hurried alongside harry as they began to wend their way out of the growing maze
	harry had the feeling that bagman was going to start offering to help him again, but just then, krum tapped harry on the shoulder
	could i haff a vordyeah, all right, said harry, slightly surprised
	vill you valk vith meokay, said harry curiously
	bagman looked slightly perturbed
	harry, shall ino, it's okay, mr
	bagman, said harry, suppressing a smile, i think i can find the castle on my own, thanks
	harry and krum left the stadium together, but krum did not set a course for the durmstrang ship
	instead, he walked toward the forest
	what're we going this way for said harry as they passed hagrid s cabin and the illuminated beauxbatons carriage
	don't vont to be overheard, said krum shortly
	when at last they had reached a quiet stretch of ground a short way from the beauxbatons horses' paddock, krum stopped in the shade of the trees and turned to face harry
	i vant to know, he said, glowering, vot there is between you and hermyownninny
	harry, who from krum's secretive manner had expected something much more serious than this, stared up at krum in amazement
	but krum glowered at him, and harry, somehow struck anew by how tall krum was, elaborated
	she's not my girlfriend and she never has been
	it's just that skeeter woman making things up
	hermyownninny talks about you very often, said krum, looking suspiciously at harry
	yeah, said harry, because were friends
	he couldn't quite believe he was having this conversation with viktor krum, the famous international quidditch player
	it was as though the eighteenyearold krum thought he
	harry, was an equal  a real rival you haff never
	no, said harry very firmly
	krum looked slightly happier
	he stared at harry for a few seconds, then said, you fly very veil
	i vos votching at the first task
	thanks, said harry, grinning broadly and suddenly feeling much taller himself
	i saw you at the quidditch world cup
	the wronski feint, you really but something moved behind krum in the trees, and harry, who had some experience of the sort of thing that lurked in the forest, instinctively grabbed krum's arm and pulled him around
	vot is itharry shook his head, staring at the place where he'd seen movement
	he slipped his hand inside his robes, reaching for his wand
	suddenly a man staggered out from behind a tall oak
	for a moment, harry didn't recognize him
	then he realized it was mr
	he looked as though he had been traveling for days
	the knees of his robes were ripped and bloody, his face scratched he was unshaven and gray with exhaustion
	his neat hair and mustache were both in need of a wash and a trim
	his strange appearance, however, was nothing to the way he was behaving
	muttering and gesticulating, mr
	crouch appeared to be talking to someone that he alone could see
	he reminded harry vividly of an old tramp he had seen once when out shopping with the dursleys
	that man too had been conversing wildly with thin air aunt petunia had seized dudley's hand and pulled him across the road to avoid him uncle vernon had then treated the family to a long rant about what he would like to do with beggars and vagrants
	vosn't he a judge said krum, staring at mr
	isn't he vith your ministryharry nodded, hesitated for a moment, then walked slowly toward mr
	crouch, who did not look at him, but continued to talk to a nearby tree
	and when you've done that, weatherby, send an owl to dumbledore confirming the number of durmstrang students who will be attending the tournament, karkaroff has just sent word there will be twelve
	crouch said harry cautiously
	and then send another owl to madame maxime, because she might want to up the number of students she's bringing, now karkaroff's made it a round dozen
	do that, weatherby, will you will you will
	crouch's eyes were bulging
	he stood staring at the tree, muttering soundlessly at it
	then he staggered sideways and fell to his knees
	crouch harry said loudly
	are you all rightcrouch's eyes were rolling in his head
	harry looked around at krum, who had followed him into the trees, and was looking down at crouch in alarm
	vot is wrong with himno idea, harry muttered
	listen, you'd better go and get someone dumbledore gasped mr
	he reached out and seized a handful of harrys robes, dragging him closer, though his eyes were staring over harry's head
	okay, said harry, if you get up, mr
	crouch, we can go up to thei've done
	he looked utterly mad
	his eyes were rolling and bulging, and a trickle of spittle was sliding down his chin
	every word he spoke seemed to cost him a terrible effort
	crouch, said harry loudly and clearly
	get up, i'll take you to dumbledoremr, crouch's eyes rolled forward onto harry
	i'm a student at the school, said harry, looking around at krum for some help, but krum was hanging back, looking extremely nervous
	his whispered crouch, his mouth sagging
	no, said harry, without the faintest idea what crouch was talking about
	dumbledore'sthat's right, said harry
	crouch was pulling him closer harry tried to loosen crouch's grip on his robes, but it was too powerful
	i'll get dumbledore if you let go of me, said harry
	crouch, and i'll get him
	thank you, weatherby, and when you have done that, i would like a cup of tea
	my wife and son will be arriving shortly, we are attending a concert tonight with mr
	crouch was now talking fluently to a tree again, and seemed completely unaware that harry was there, which surprised harry so much he didn't notice that crouch had released him
	yes, my son has recently gained twelve o
	s, most satisfactory, yes, thank you, yes, very proud indeed
	now, if you could bring me that memo from the andorran minister of magic, i think i will have time to draft a response
	you stay here with him  harry said to krum
	i'll get dumbledore, i'll be quicker, i know where his office is he is mad, said krum doubtfully, staring down at crouch, who was still gabbling to the tree, apparently convinced it was percy
	just stay with him, said harry, starting to get up, but his movement seemed to trigger another abrupt change in mr
	crouch, who seized him hard around the knees and pulled harry back to the ground
	me  he whispered, his eyes bulging again
	i'll get dumbledore if you let me go, mr
	he looked furiously around at krum
	help me, will youlooking extremely apprehensive, krum moved forward and squatted down next to mr
	just keep him here, said harry, pulling himself free of mr
	i'll be back with dumbledore
	hurry, von't you  krum called after him as harry sprinted away from the forest and up through the dark grounds
	they were deserted bagman, cedric, and fleur had disappeared
	harry tore up the stone steps, through the oak front doors, and off up the marble staircase, toward the second floor
	five minutes later he was hurtling toward a stone gargoyle standing halfway along an empty corridor
	sher  sherbet lemon he panted at it
	this was the password to the hidden staircase to dumbledore's office  or at least, it had been two years ago
	the password had evidently changed, however, for the stone gargoyle did not spring to life and jump aside, but stood frozen, glaring at harry malevolently
	move harry shouted at it
	c'monbut nothing at hogwarts had ever moved just because he shouted at it he knew it was no good
	he looked up and down the dark corridor
	perhaps dumbledore was in the staffroom  he started running as fast as he could toward the staircase potterharry skidded to a halt and looked around
	snape had just emerged from the hidden staircase behind the stone gargoyle
	the wall was sliding shut behind him even as he beckoned harry back toward him
	what are you doing here, potteri need to see professor dumbledore  said harry, running back up the corridor and skidding to a standstill in front of snape instead
	he's just turned up
	he's asking what is this rubbish said snape, his black eyes glittering
	what are you talking aboutmr
	crouch  harry shouted
	from the ministry  he's ill or something  he's in the forest, he wants to see dumbledore  just give me the password up to the headmaster is busy
	potter, said snape, his thin mouth curling into an unpleasant smile
	i've got to tell dumbledore harry yelled
	potterharry could tell snape was thoroughly enjoying himself, denying harry the thing he wanted when he was so panicky
	look, said harry angrily, crouch isn't right  he's  he's out of his mind  he says he wants to warn the stone wall behind snape slid open
	dumbledore was standing there, wearing long green robes and a mildly curious expression
	is there a problem he said, looking between harry and snape
	professor harry said, sidestepping snape before snape could speak, mr
	crouch is here  he's down in the forest, he wants to speak to youharry expected dumbledore to ask questions, but to his relief, dumbledore did nothing of the sort
	lead the way, he said promptly, and he swept off along the corridor behind harry, leaving snape standing next to the gargoyle and looking twice as ugly
	harry said dumbledore as they walked swiftly down the marble staircase
	said he wants to warn you
	said he's done something terrible
	he mentioned his son
	something about voldemort getting stronger
	indeed, said dumbledore, and he quickened his pace as they hurried out into the pitchdarkness
	he's not acting normally, harry said, hurrying along beside dumbledore
	he doesn't seem to know where he is
	he keeps talking like he thinks percy weasley's there, and then he changes, and says he needs to see you
	i left him with viktor krum
	you did  said dumbledore sharply, and he began to take longer strides still, so that harry was running to keep up
	do you know if anybody else saw mr
	crouchno, said harry
	krum and i were talking, mr
	bagman had just finished telling us about the third task, we stayed behind, and then we saw mr
	crouch coming out of the forest where are they said dumbledore as the beauxbatons carriage emerged from the darkness
	over here, said harry, moving in front of dumbledore, leading the way through the trees
	he couldn't hear crouch's voice anymore, but he knew where he was going it hadn't been much past the beauxbatons carriage
	somewhere around here
	viktor  harry shouted
	they were here, harry said to dumbledore
	they were definitely somewhere around here
	lumos, dumbledore said, lighting his wand and holding it up
	its narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black trunk, illuminating the ground
	and then it fell upon a pair of feet
	harry and dumbledore hurried forward
	krum was sprawled on the forest floor
	he seemed to be unconscious
	there was no sign at all of mr
	dumbledore bent over krum and gently lifted one of his eyelids
	stunned, he said softly
	his halfmoon glasses glittered in the wandlight as he peered around at the surrounding trees
	should i go and get someone  said harry
	madam pomfreyno, said dumbledore swiftly
	he raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the direction of hagrid's cabin
	harry saw something silvery dart out of it and streak away through the trees like a ghostly bird
	then dumbledore bent over krum again, pointed his wand at him, and muttered, ennervate
	when he saw dumbledore, he tried to sit up, but dumbledore put a hand on his shoulder and made him lie still
	he attacked me krum muttered, putting a hand up to his head
	the old madman attacked me  i vos looking around to see vare potter had gone and he attacked from behindlie still for a moment, dumbledore said
	the sound of thunderous footfalls reached them, and hagrid came panting into sight with fang at his heels
	he was carrying his crossbow
	professor dumbledore he said, his eyes widening
	harry  what the  hagrid, i need you to fetch professor karkaroff, said dumbledore
	his student has been attacked
	when you've done that, kindly alert professor moody no need, dumbledore, said a wheezy growl
	moody was limping toward them, leaning on his staff, his wand lit
	damn leg, he said furiously
	would've been here quicker
	what's happened snape said something about crouch crouch  said hagrid blankly
	karkaroff, please, hagrid  said dumbledore sharply
	right y'are, professor
	said hagrid, and he turned and disappeared into the dark trees, fang trotting after him
	i don't know where barty crouch is, dumbledore told moody, but it is essential that we find him
	i'm onto it, growled moody, and he pulled out his wand and limped off into the forest
	neither dumbledore nor harry spoke again until they heard the unmistakable sounds of hagrid and fang returning
	karkaroff was hurrying along behind them
	he was wearing his sleek silver furs, and he looked pale and agitated
	what is this he cried when he saw krum on the ground and dumbledore and harry beside him
	what's going oni vos attacked said krum, sitting up now and rubbing his head
	crouch or votever his name crouch attacked you  crouch attacked you  the triwizard judgeigor, dumbledore began, but karkaroff had drawn himself up, clutching his furs around him, looking livid
	treachery he bellowed, pointing at dumbledore
	it is a plot  you and your ministry of magic have lured me here under false pretenses, dumbledore  this is not an equal competition  first you sneak potter into the tournament, though he is underage  now one of your ministry friends attempts to put my champion out of action  i smell doubledealing and corruption in this whole affair, and you, dumbledore, you, with your talk of closer internationalwizarding links, of rebuilding old ties, of forgetting old differences  here's what i think of youkarkaroff spat onto the ground at dumbledore's feet
	in one swift movement, hagrid seized the front of karkaroff's furs, lifted him into the air, and slammed him against a nearby tree
	apologize hagrid snarled as karkaroff gasped for breath, hagrid's massive fist at his throat, his feet dangling in midair
	hagrid, no dumbledore shouted, his eyes flashing
	hagrid removed the hand pinning karkaroff to the tree, and karkaroff slid all the way down the trunk and slumped in a huddle at its roots a few twigs and leaves showered down upon his head
	kindly escort harry back up to the castle, hagrid,  said dumbledore sharply
	breathing heavily, hagrid gave karkaroff a glowering look
	maybe i'd better stay here
	you will take harry back to school, hagrid, dumbledore repeated firmly
	take him right up to gryffindor tower
	and harry  i want you to stay there
	anything you might want to do  any owls you might want to send  they can wait until morning, do you understand meer  yes, said harry, staring at him
	how had dumbledore known that, at that very moment, he had been thinking about sending pigwidgeon straight to sirius, to tell him what had happenedi'll leave fang with yeh
	headmaster, hagrid said, staring menacingly at karkaroff, who was still sprawled at the foot of the tree, tangled in furs and tree roots
	they marched in silence past the beauxbatons carriage and up toward the castle
	how dare he, hagrid growled as they strode past the lake
	how dare he accuse dumbledore
	like dumbledore'd do anythin' like that
	like dumbledore wanted you in the tournament in the firs' place
	worried  i dunno when i seen dumbledore more worried than he's bin lately
	an' you  hagrid suddenly said angrily to harry, who looked up at him, taken aback
	what were yeh doin', wanderin' off with ruddy krum  he's from durmstrang, harry coulda jinxed yeh right there, couldn he  hasn' moody taught yeh nothin'  'magine lettin him lure yeh off on yer own krum's all right  said harry as they climbed the steps into the entrance hall
	he wasn't trying to jinx me, he just wanted to talk about hermione i'll be havin' a few words with her, an' all, said hagrid grimly, stomping up the stairs
	the less you lot 'ave ter do with these foreigners, the happier yeh'll be
	yeh can trust any of 'em
	you were getting on all right with madame maxime, harry said, annoyed
	don' you talk ter me abou' her  said hagrid, and he looked quite frightening for a moment
	i've got her number now  tryin' ter get back in me good books, tryin' ter get me ter tell her what's comin in the third task
	ha  you can' trust any of'emhagrid was in such a bad mood, harry was quite glad to say goodbye to him in front of the fat lady
	he clambered through the portrait hole into the common room and hurried straight for the corner where ron and hermione were sitting, to tell them what had happened
	chapter twentynine  the dreamit comes down to this, said hermione, rubbing her forehead
	crouch attacked viktor, or somebody else attacked both of them when viktor wasn't looking
	it must've been crouch, said ron at once
	that's why he was gone when harry and dumbledore got there
	i don't think so, said harry, shaking his head
	he seemed really weak  i don't reckon he was up to disapparating or anything
	you cant disapparate on the hogwarts grounds, haven't i told you enough times said hermione
	hows this for a theory, said ron excitedly
	krum attacked crouch  no, wait for it  and then stunned himselfand mr
	crouch evaporated, did he said hermione coldly
	harry, ron, and hermione had crept out of their dormitories very early and hurried up to the owlery together to send a note to sirius
	now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds
	all three of them were puffyeyed and pale because they had been talking late into the night about mr
	just go through it again, harry, said hermione
	crouch actually sayi've told you, he wasn't making much sense, said harry
	he said he wanted to warn dumbledore about something
	he definitely mentioned bertha jorkins, and he seemed to think she was dead
	he kept saying stuff was his fault
	he mentioned his son
	well, that was his fault, said hermione testily
	he was out of his mind, said harry
	half the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive, and he kept talking to percy about work and giving him instructions
	remind me what he said about youknowwho said ron tentatively
	i've told you, harry repeated dully
	he said he's getting stronger
	then ron said in a falsely confident voice, but he was out of his mind, like you said, so half of it was probably just raving
	he was sanest when he was trying to talk about voldemort, said harry, and ron winced at the sound of the name
	he was having real trouble stringing two words together, but that was when he seemed to know where he was, and know what he wanted to do
	he just kept saying he had to see dumbledore
	harry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters
	the many perches were halfempty every now and then, another owl would swoop in through one of the windows, returning from its night's hunting with a mouse in its beak
	if snape hadn't held me up, harry said bitterly, we might've got there in time
	'the headmaster is busy
	what's this rubbish, potter'  why couldn't he have just got out of the waymaybe he didn't want you to get there said ron quickly
	maybe  hang on  how fast d'you reckon he could've gotten down to the forest  d'you reckon he could've beaten you and dumbledore therenot unless he can turn himself into a bat or something, said harry
	wouldn't put it past him, ron muttered
	we need to see professor moody, said hermione
	we need to find out whether he found mr
	crouch,if he had the marauder's map on him, it would've been easy, said harry
	unless crouch was already outside the grounds, said ron, because it only shows up to the boundaries, doesn't shh said hermione suddenly
	somebody was climbing the steps up to the owlery
	harry could hear two voices arguing, coming closer and closer
	that's blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of trouble for that we've tried being polite it's time to play dirty, like him
	he wouldn't like the ministry of magic knowing what he did i'm telling you, if you put that in writing, it's blackmailyeah, and you won't be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff, will youthe owlery door banged open
	fred and george came over the threshold, then froze at the sight of harry, ron, and hermione
	what're you doing here  ron and fred said at the same time
	sending a letter, said harry and george in unison
	what, at this time  said hermione and fred
	fine  we won't ask you what you're doing, if you don't ask us, he said
	he was holding a sealed envelope in his hands
	harry glanced at it, but fred, whether accidentally or on purpose, shifted his hand so that the name on it was covered
	well, don't let us hold you up, fred said, making a mock bow and pointing at the door
	who're you blackmailing he said
	the grin vanished from fred's face
	harry saw george half glance at fred, before smiling at ron
	don't be stupid, i was only joking, he said easily
	didn't sound like that, said ron
	fred and george looked at each other
	then fred said abruptly, i've told you before, ron, keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is
	can't see why you would, but it's my business if you're blackmailing someone, said ron
	george's right, you could end up in serious trouble for that
	told you, i was joking, said george
	he walked over to fred, pulled the letter out of his hands, and began attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl
	you're starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother, you are, ron
	carry on like this and you'll be made a prefect
	no, i won't said ron hotly
	george carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off
	george turned around and grinned at ron
	well, stop telling people what to do then
	he and fred left the owlery
	harry, ron, and hermione stared at one another
	you don't think they know something about all this, do you  hermione whispered
	about crouch and everythingno, said harry
	if it was something that serious, they'd tell someone
	they'd tell dumbledore
	ron, however, was looking uncomfortable
	what's the matter hermione asked him
	said ron slowly, i dunno if they would
	they're obsessed with making money lately, i noticed it when i was hanging around with them  when  you know we weren't talking
	harry finished the sentence for him
	it's this joke shop idea they've got, said ron
	i thought they were only saying it to annoy mum, but they really mean it, they want to start one
	they've only got a year left at hogwarts, they keep going on about how it's time to think about their future, and dad can't help them, and they need gold to get started
	hermione was looking uncomfortable now
	they wouldn't do anything against the law to get gold
	wouldn't they said ron, looking skeptical
	they don't exactly mind breaking rules, do theyyes, but this is the law said hermione, looking scared
	this isn't some silly school rule
	they'll get a lot more than detention for blackmail  ron
	maybe you'd better tell percy
	are you mad  said ron
	tell percy  he'd probably do a crouch and turn them in
	he stared at the window through which fred and george's owl had departed, then said, come on, let's get some breakfast
	d'you think it's too early to go and see professor moody  hermione said as they went down the spiral staircase
	he'd probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn he'll think we're trying to attack him while he's asleep
	let's give it till break
	history of magic had rarely gone so slowly
	harry kept checking ron's watch, having finally discarded his own, but ron's was moving so slowly he could have sworn it had stopped working too
	all three of them were so tired they could happily have put their heads down on the desks and slept even hermione wasn't taking her usual notes, but was sitting with her head on her hand, gazing at professor binns with her eyes out of focus
	when the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the corridors toward the dark arts classroom and found professor moody leaving it
	he looked as tired as they felt
	the eyelid of his normal eye was drooping, giving his face an even more lopsided appearance than usual
	professor moody  harry called as they made their way toward him through the crowd
	hello, potter, growled moody
	his magical eye followed a couple of passing first years, who sped up, looking nervous it rolled into the back of moody's head and watched them around the corner before he spoke again
	he stood back to let them into his empty classroom, limped in after them, and closed the door
	did you find him  harry asked without preamble
	crouchno, said moody
	he moved over to his desk, sat down, stretched out his wooden leg with a slight groan, and pulled out his hip flask
	did you use the map harry said
	of course, said moody, taking a swig from his flask
	took a leaf out of your book, potter
	summoned it from my office into the forest
	he wasn't anywhere on there
	so he did disapparate  said ron
	you can't disapparate on the grounds, ron said hermione
	there are other ways he could have disappeared, aren't there, professormoody's magical eye quivered as it rested on hermione
	you're another one who might think about a career as an auror, he told her
	mind works the right way
	hermione flushed pink with pleasure
	well, he wasn't invisible, said harry
	the map shows invisible people
	he must've left the grounds, then
	but under his own steam  said hermione eagerly, or because someone made himyeah, someone could've  could've pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him, couldn't they  said ron quickly, looking hopefully at moody as if he too wanted to be told he had the makings of an auror
	we can't rule out kidnap, growled moody
	so, said ron, d'you reckon he's somewhere in hogsmeadecould be anywhere, said moody, shaking his head
	only thing we know for sure is that he's not here
	he yawned widely, so that his scars stretched, and his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth
	then he said, now, dumbledore's told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators, but there's nothing you can do for crouch
	the ministry'll be looking for him now, dumbledore's notified them
	potter, you just keep your mind on the third task
	he hadn't given the maze a single thought since he'd left it with krum the previous night
	should be right up your street, this one, said moody, looking up at harry and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin
	from what dumbledore's said, you've managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times
	broke your way through a series of obstacles guarding the sorcerers stone in your first year, didn't youwe helped, ron said quickly
	me and hermione helped
	well, help him practice for this one, and i'll be very surprised if he doesn't win, said moody
	constant vigilance, potter
	he took another long draw from his hip flask, and his magical eye swiveled onto the window
	the topmost sail of the durmstrang ship was visible through it
	you two, counseled moody, his normal eye on ron and hermione, you stick close to potter, all right i'm keeping an eye on things, but all the same
	you can never have too many eyes out
	sirius sent their owl back the very next morning
	it fluttered down beside harry at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of hermione, clutching a copy of the daily prophet in its beak
	she took the newspaper, scanned the first few pages, said, ha  she hasn't got wind of crouch  then joined ron and harry in reading what sirius had to say on the mysterious events of the night before last
	harry  what do you think you are playing at, walking off into the forest with viktor krum  i want you to swear, by return owl, that you are not going to go walking with anyone else at night
	there is somebody highly dangerous at hogwarts
	it is clear to me that they wanted to stop crouch from seeing dumbledore and you were probably feet away from them in the dark
	you could have been killed
	your name didn't get into the goblet of fire by accident
	if someone's trying to attack you, they're on their last chance
	stay close to ron and hermione, do not leave gryffindor tower after hours, and arm yourself for the third task
	practice stunning and disarming
	a few hexes wouldn't go amiss either
	there's nothing you can do about crouch
	keep your head down and look after yourself
	i'm waiting for your letter giving me your word you won't stray outofbounds again
	siriuswho's he, to lecture me about being outofbounds  said harry in mild indignation as he folded up sirius's letter and put it inside his robes
	after all the stuff he did at schoolhe's worried about you  said hermione sharply
	just like moody and hagrid  so listen to themno one's tried to attack me all year, said harry
	no one's done anything to me at allexcept put your name in the goblet of fire, said hermione
	and they must've done that for a reason
	maybe they've been biding their time
	maybe this is the task they're going to get you
	look, said harry impatiently, let's say sirius is right, and someone stunned krum to kidnap crouch
	well, they would've been in the trees near us, wouldn't they  but they waited till i was out of the way until they acted, didn't they  so it doesn't look like i'm their target, does itthey couldn't have made it look like an accident if they'd murdered you in the forest said hermione
	but if you die during a taskthey didn't care about attacking krum, did they  said harry
	why didn't they just polish me off at the same time  they could've made it look like krum and i had a duel or something
	harry, i don't understand it either, said hermione desperately
	i just know there are a lot of odd things going on, and i don't like it
	moody's right  sirius is right  you've got to get in training for the third task, straight away
	and you make sure you write back to sirius and promise him you're not going to go sneaking off alone again
	the hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting than when harry had to stay indoors
	for the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the library with hermione and ron, looking up hexes, or else in empty classrooms, which they sneaked into to practice
	harry was concentrating on the stunning spell, which he had never used before
	the trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on ron's and hermione's part
	norris ron suggested on monday lunchtime as he lay flat on his back in the middle of their charms classroom, having just been stunned and reawoken by harry for the fifth time in a row
	let's stun her for a bit
	or you could use dobby, harry, i bet he'd do anything to help you
	i'm not complaining or anything  he got gingerly to his feet, rubbing his backside  but i'm aching all over
	well, you keep missing the cushions, don't you  said hermione impatiently, rearranging the pile of cushions they had used for the banishing spell, which flitwick had left in a cabinet
	just try and fall backwardonce you're stunned, you can't aim too well, hermione said ron angrily
	why don't you take a turnwell, i think harry's got it now, anyway, said hermione hastily
	and we don't have to worry about disarming, because he's been able to do that for ages
	i think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening
	she looked down the list they had made in the library
	i like the look of this one, she said, this impediment curse
	should slow down anything that's trying to attack you
	we'll start with that one
	they hastily shoved the cushions back into flitwicks cupboard and slipped out of the classroom
	see you at dinner  said hermione, and she set off for arithmancy, while harry and ron headed toward north tower, and divination
	broad strips of dazzling gold sunlight tell across the corridor from the high windows
	the sky outside was so brightly blue it looked as though it had been enameled
	it's going to be boiling in trelawney's room, she never puts out that fire, said ron as they started up the staircase toward the silver ladder and the trapdoor
	the dimly lit room was swelteringly hot
	the fumes from the perfumed fire were heavier than ever
	harrys head swam as he made his way over to one of the curtained windows
	while professor trelawney was looking the other way, disentangling her shawl from a lamp, he opened it an inch or so and settled back in his chintz armchair, so that a soft breeze played across his face
	it was extremely comfortable
	my dears, said professor trelawney, sitting down in her winged armchair in front of the class and peering around at them all with her strangely enlarged eyes, we have almost finished our work on planetary divination
	today, however, will be an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of mars, for he is placed most interestingly at the present time
	if you will all look this way, i will dim the lights
	she waved her wand and the lamps went out
	the fire was the only source of light now
	professor trelawney bent down and lifted, from under her chair, a miniature model of the solar system, contained within a glass dome
	it was a beautiful thing each of the moons glimmered in place around the nine planets and the fiery sun, all of them hanging in thin air beneath the glass
	harry watched lazily as professor trelawney began to point out the fascinating angle mars was making to neptune
	the heavily perfumed fumes washed over him, and the breeze from the window played across his face
	he could hear an insect humming gently somewhere behind the curtain
	his eyelids began to droop
	he was riding on the back of an eagle owl, soaring through the clear blue sky toward an old, ivycovered house set high on a hillside
	lower and lower they flew, the wind blowing pleasantly in harry's face, until they reached a dark and broken window in the upper story of the house and entered
	now they were flying along a gloomy passageway, to a room at the very end
	through the door they went, into a dark room whose windows were boarded up
	harry had left the owl's back
	he was watching, now, as it fluttered across the room, into a chair with its back to him
	there were two dark shapes on the floor beside the chair
	both of them were stirring
	one was a huge snake
	the other was a man
	a short, balding man, a man with watery eyes and a pointed nose
	he was wheezing and sobbing on the hearth rug
	you are in luck, wormtail, said a cold, highpitched voice from the depths of the chair in which the owl had landed
	you are very fortunate indeed
	your blunder has not ruined everything
	my lord gasped the man on the floor
	nagini, said the cold voice, you are out of luck
	i will not be feeding wormtail to you, after all
	but never mind, never mind
	there is still harry potter
	harry could see its tongue fluttering
	now, wormtail, said the cold voice, perhaps one more little reminder why i will not tolerate another blunder from you
	the tip of a wand emerged from around the back of the chair
	it was pointing at wormtail
	crucio said the cold voice
	wormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve in his body were on fire, the screaming filled harry's ears as the scar on his forehead seared with pain he was yelling too
	voldemort would hear him, would know he was there
	harry  harryharry opened his eyes
	he was lying on the floor of professor trelawney's room with his hands over his face
	his scar was still burning so badly that his eyes were watering
	the pain had been real
	the whole class was standing around him, and ron was kneeling next to him, looking terrified
	you all right he said
	of course he isn't said professor trelawney, looking thoroughly excited
	her great eyes loomed over harry, gazing at him
	potter  a premonition  an apparition what did you seenothing,  harry lied
	he could feel himself shaking
	he couldn't stop himself from looking around, into the shadows behind him voldemorts voice had sounded so close
	you were clutching your scar  said professor trelawney
	you were rolling on the floor, clutching your scar  come now
	potter, i have experience in these mattersharry looked up at her
	i need to go to the hospital wing, i think, he said
	my dear, you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room  said professor trelawney
	if you leave now, you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever i don't want to see anything except a headache cure, said harry
	the class backed away
	they all looked unnerved
	see you later, harry muttered to ron, and he picked up his bag and headed for the trapdoor, ignoring professor trelawney, who was wearing an expression of great frustration, as though she had just been denied a real treat
	when harry reached the bottom of her stepladder, however, he did not set off for the hospital wing
	he had no intention whatsoever of going there
	sirius had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again, and harry was going to follow his advice he was going straight to dumbledore's office
	he marched down the corridors, thinking about what he had seen in the dream
	it had been as vivid as the one that had awoken him on privet drive
	he ran over the details in his mind, trying to make sure he could remember them
	he had heard voldemort accusing wormtail of making a blunder
	but the owl had brought good news, the blunder had been repaired, somebody was dead
	so wormtail was not going to be fed to the snake
	he, harry, was going to be fed to it instead
	harry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to dumbledores office without noticing
	he blinked, looked around, realized what he had done, and retraced his steps, stopping in front of it
	then he remembered that he didn't know the password
	sherbet lemon he tried tentatively
	the gargoyle did not move
	okay, said harry, staring at it, pear drop
	drooble's best blowing gum
	bertie bott's every flavor beans
	oh no, he doesn't like them, does he
	oh just open, can't you he said angrily
	i really need to see him, its urgentthe gargoyle remained immovable
	harry kicked it, achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in his big toe
	chocolate frog  he yelled angrily, standing on one leg
	sugar quill  cockroach clusterthe gargoyle sprang to life and jumped aside
	cockroach cluster he said, amazed
	he hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped onto the foot of a spiral stone staircase, which moved slowly upward as the doors closed behind him, taking him up to a polished oak door with a brass door knocker
	he could hear voices from inside the office
	he stepped off the moving staircase and hesitated, listening
	dumbledore, i'm afraid i don't see the connection, don't see it at all  it was the voice of the minister of magic, cornelius fudge
	ludo says berthas perfectly capable of getting herself lost
	i agree we would have expected to have found her by now, but all the same, we've no evidence of foul play, dumbledore, none at all
	as for her disappearance being linked with barty crouch'sand what do you thinks happened to barty crouch, minister  said moody's growling voice
	i see two possibilities, alastor, said fudge
	either crouch has finally cracked  more than likely, i'm sure you'll agree, given his personal history  lost his mind, and gone wandering off somewhere he wandered extremely quickly, if that is the case, cornelius, said dumbledore calmly
	fudge sounded embarrassed
	well, i'll reserve judgment until after i've seen the place where he was found, but you say it was just past the beauxbatons carriage dumbledore, you know what that woman isi consider her to be a very able headmistress  and an excellent dancer, said dumbledore quietly
	dumbledore, come  said fudge angrily
	don't you think you might be prejudiced in her favor because of hagrid  they don't all turn out harmless  if, indeed, you can call hagrid harmless, with that monster fixation he's got i no more suspect madame maxime than hagrid, said dumbledore, just as calmly
	i think it possible that it is you who are prejudiced, cornelius
	can we wrap up this discussion growled moody
	yes, yes, let's go down to the grounds, then, said fudge impatiently
	no, it's not that, said moody, it's just that potter wants a word with you, dumbledore
	he's just outside the door
	chapter thirty  the pensieve the door of the office opened
	hello, potter, said moody
	he had been inside dumbledore's office once before it was a very beautiful, circular room, lined with pictures of previous headmasters and headmistresses of hogwarts, all of whom were fast asleep, their chests rising and falling gently
	cornelius fudge was standing beside dumbledore's desk, wearing his usual pinstriped cloak and holding his limegreen bowler hat
	harry  said fudge jovially, moving forward
	how are youfine, harry lied
	we were just talking about the night when mr
	crouch turned up on the grounds, said fudge
	it was you who found him, was it notyes, said harry
	then, feeling it was pointless to pretend that he hadn't overheard what they had been saying, he added,  i didn't see madame maxime anywhere, though, and she'd have a job hiding, wouldn't shedumbledore smiled at harry behind fudge's back, his eyes twinkling
	yes, well, said fudge, looking embarrassed, we're about to go for a short walk on the grounds, harry, if you'll excuse us
	perhaps if you just go back to your class i wanted to talk to you
	professor, harry said quickly, looking at dumbledore, who gave him a swift, searching look
	wait here for me, harry, he said
	our examination of the grounds will not take long
	they trooped out in silence past him and closed the door
	after a minute or so, harry heard the clunks of moody's wooden leg growing fainter in the corridor below
	hello, fawkes, he said
	fawkes, professor dumbledore's phoenix, was standing on his golden perch beside the door
	the size of a swan, with magnificent scarletandgold plumage, he swished his long tail and blinked benignly at harry
	harry sat down in a chair in front of dumbledore's desk
	for several minutes, he sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their frames, thinking about what he had just heard, and running his fingers over his scar
	it had stopped hurting now
	he felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in dumbledore's office, knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream
	harry looked up at the walls behind the desk
	the patched and ragged sorting hat was standing on a shelf
	a glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies set into the hilt, which harry recognized as the one he himself had pulled out of the sorting hat in his second year
	the sword had once belonged to godric gryffindor, founder of harry's house
	he was gazing at it, remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was lost, when he noticed a patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the glass case
	he looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of silverwhite shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him, whose door had not been closed properly
	harry hesitated, glanced at fawkes, then got up, walked across the office, and pulled open the cabinet door
	a shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the edge runes and symbols that harry did not recognize
	the silvery light was coming from the basin's contents, which were like nothing harry had ever seen before
	he could not tell whether the substance was liquid or gas
	it was a bright, whitish silver, and it was moving ceaselessly the surface of it became ruffled like water beneath wind, and then, like clouds, separated and swirled smoothly
	it looked like light made liquid  or like wind made solid  harry couldn't make up his mind
	he wanted to touch it, to find out what it felt like, but nearly four years' experience of the magical world told him that sticking his hand into a bowl full of some unknown substance was a very stupid thing to do
	he therefore pulled his wand out of the inside of his robes, cast a nervous look around the office, looked back at the contents of the basin, and prodded them
	the surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl very fast
	harry bent closer, his head right inside the cabinet
	the silvery substance had become transparent it looked like glass
	he looked down into it expecting to see the stone bottom of the basin  and saw instead an enormous room below the surface of the mysterious substance, a room into which he seemed to be looking through a circular window in the ceiling
	the room was dimly lit he thought it might even be underground, for there were no windows, merely torches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated the walls of hogwarts
	lowering his face so that his nose was a mere inch away from the glassy substance, harry saw that rows and rows of witches and wizards were seated around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in levels
	an empty chair stood in the very center of the room
	there was something about the chair that gave harry an ominous feeling
	chains encircled the arms of it, as though its occupants were usually tied to it
	where was this place  it surely wasn't hogwarts he had never seen a room like that here in the castle
	moreover, the crowd in the mysterious room at the bottom of the basin was comprised of adults, and harry knew there were not nearly that many teachers at hogwarts
	they seemed, he thought, to be waiting for something even though he could only see the tops of their hats, all of their faces seemed to be pointing in one direction, and none of them were talking to one another
	the basin being circular, and the room he was observing square, harry could not make out what was going on in the corners of it
	he leaned even closer, tilting his head, trying to see
	the tip of his nose touched the strange substance into which he was staring
	dumbledore's office gave an almighty lurch  harry was thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basin but his head did not hit the stone bottom
	he was falling through something icycold and black it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool and suddenly, harry found himself sitting on a bench at the end of the room inside the basin, a bench raised high above the others
	he looked up at the high stone ceiling, expecting to see the circular window through which he had just been staring, but there was nothing there but dark, solid stone
	breathing hard and fast
	harry looked around him
	not one of the witches and wizards in the room and there were at least two hundred of them was looking at him
	not one of them seemed to have noticed that a fourteenyearold boy had just dropped from the ceiling into their midst
	harry turned to the wizard next to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that reverberated around the silent room
	he was sitting right next to albus dumbledore
	professor harry said in a kind of strangled whisper
	i'm sorry  i didn't mean to  i was just looking at that basin in your cabinet  i  where are webut dumbledore didn't move or speak
	he ignored harry completely
	like every other wizard on the benches, he was staring into the far corner of the room, where there was a door
	harry gazed, nonplussed, at dumbledore, then around at the silently watchful crowd, then back at dumbledore
	and then it dawned on him
	harry had found himself somewhere that nobody could see or hear him
	that time, he had fallen through a page in an enchanted diary, right into somebody else's memory
	and unless he was very much mistaken, something of the sort had happened again
	harry raised his right hand, hesitated, and then waved it energetically in from of dumbledore's face
	dumbledore did not blink, look around at harry, or indeed move at all
	and that, in harry's opinion, settled the matter
	dumbledore wouldn't ignore him like that
	he was inside a memory, and this was not the presentday dumbledore
	yet it couldn't be that long ago
	the dumbledore sitting next to him now was silverhaired, just like the presentday dumbledore
	but what was this place  what were all these wizards waiting forharry looked around more carefully
	the room, as he had suspected when observing it from above, was almost certainly underground  more of a dungeon than a room, he thought
	there was a bleak and forbidding air about the place there were no pictures on the walls, no decorations at all just these serried rows of benches, rising in levels all around the room, all positioned so that they had a clear view of that chair with the chains on its arms
	before harry could reach any conclusions about the place in which they were, he heard footsteps
	the door in the corner of the dungeon opened and three people entered  or at least one man, flanked by two dementors
	harry's insides went cold
	the dementors  tall, hooded creatures whose faces were concealed  were gliding slowly toward the chair in the center of the room, each grasping one of the man's arms with their dead and rottenlooking hands
	the man between them looked as though he was about to faint, and harry couldn't blame him
	he knew the dementors could not touch him inside a memory, but he remembered their power only too well
	the watching crowd recoiled slightly as the dementors placed the man in the chained chair and glided back out of the room
	the door swung shut behind them
	harry looked down at the man now sitting in the chair and saw that it was karkaroff
	unlike dumbledore, karkaroff looked much younger his hair and goatee were black
	he was not dressed in sleek furs, but in thin and ragged robes
	even as harry watched, the chains on the arms of the chair glowed suddenly gold and snaked their way up karkaroff's arms, binding him there
	igor karkaroff, said a curt voice to harry's left
	harry looked around and saw mr
	crouch standing up in the middle of the bench beside him
	crouch's hair was dark, his face was much less lined, he looked fit and alert
	you have been brought from azkaban to present evidence to the ministry of magic
	you have given us to understand that you have important information for us
	karkaroff straightened himself as best he could, tightly bound to the chair
	i have, sir, he said, and although his voice was very scared, harry could still hear the familiar unctuous note in it
	i wish to be of use to the ministry
	i  i know that the ministry is trying to  to round up the last of the dark lords supporters
	i am eager to assist in any way i can
	there was a murmur around the benches
	some of the wizards and witches were surveying karkaroff with interest, others with pronounced mistrust
	then harry heard, quite distinctly, from dumbledores other side, a familiar, growling voice saying, filth
	harry leaned forward so that he could see past dumbledore
	madeye moody was sitting there  except that there was a very noticeable difference in his appearance
	he did not have his magical eye, but two normal ones
	both were looking down upon karkaroff, and both were narrowed in intense dislike
	crouch is going to let him out, moody breathed quietly to dumbledore
	he's done a deal with him
	took me six months to track him down, and crouch is going to let him go if he's got enough new names
	let's hear his information, i say, and throw him straight back to the dementors
	dumbledore made a small noise of dissent through his long, crooked nose
	ah, i was forgetting
	you don't like the dementors, do you, albus said moody with a sardonic smile
	no, said dumbledore calmly, i'm afraid i don't
	i have long felt the ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures
	but for filth like this
	you say you have names for us, karkaroff, said mr
	let us hear them, please
	you must understand, said karkaroff hurriedly, that hewhomustnotbenamed operated always in the greatest secrecy
	he preferred that we  i mean to say, his supporters  and i regret now, very deeply, that i ever counted myself among them get on with it, sneered moody
	we never knew the names of every one of our fellows  he alone knew exactly who we all were which was a wise move, wasn't it, as it prevented someone like you, karkaroff, from turning all of them in, muttered moody
	yet you say you have some names for us said mr
	i  i do, said karkaroff breathlessly
	and these were important supporters, mark you
	people i saw with my own eyes doing his bidding
	i give this information as a sign that i fully and totally renounce him, and am filled with a remorse so deep i can barely these names are said mr
	karkaroff drew a deep breath
	there was antonin dolohov, he said
	i  i saw him torture countless muggles and  and nonsupporters of the dark lord
	and helped him do it, murmured moody
	we have already apprehended dolohov, said crouch
	he was caught shortly after yourself
	indeed said karkaroff, his eyes widening
	i  i am delighted to hear itbut he didn't look it
	harry could tell that this news had come as a real blow to him
	one of his names was worthless
	any others  said crouch coldly
	there was rosier, said karkaroff hurriedly
	rosier is dead, said crouch
	he was caught shortly after you were too
	he preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was killed in the struggle
	took a bit of me with him, though, whispered moody to harry's right
	harry looked around at him once more, and saw him indicating the large chunk out of his nose to dumbledore
	no  no more than rosier deserved  said karkaroff, a real note of panic in his voice now
	harry could see that he was starting to worry that none of his information would be of any use to the ministry
	karkaroff's eyes darted toward the door in the corner, behind which the dementors undoubtedly still stood, waiting
	any more  said crouch
	there was travers  he helped murder the mckinnons mulciber  he specialized in the imperius curse, forced countless people to do horrific things rookwood, who was a spy, and passed hewhomustnotbenamed useful information from inside the ministry itselfharry could tell that, this time, karkaroff had struck gold
	the watching crowd was all murmuring together
	crouch, nodding to a witch sitting in front of him, who began scribbling upon her piece of parchment
	augustus rookwood of the department of mysteriesthe very same, said karkaroff eagerly
	i believe he used a network of wellplaced wizards, both inside the ministry and out, to collect information but travers and mulciber we have, said mr
	very well, karkaroff, if that is all, you will be returned to azkaban while we decide not yet cried karkaroff, looking quite desperate
	wait, i have moreharry could see him sweating in the torchlight, his white skin contrasting strongly with the black of his hair and beard
	severus snapesnape has been cleared by this council, said crouch disdainfully
	he has been vouched for by albus dumbledore
	no  shouted karkaroff, straining at the chains that bound him to the chair
	i assure you  severus snape is a death eaterdumbledore had gotten to his feet
	i have given evidence already on this matter, he said calmly
	severus snape was indeed a death eater
	however, he rejoined our side before lord voldemort's downfall and turned spy for us, at great personal risk
	he is now no more a death eater than i am
	harry turned to look at madeye moody
	he was wearing a look of deep skepticism behind dumbledore's back
	very well, karkaroff, crouch said coldly, you have been of assistance
	i shall review your case
	you will return to azkaban in the meantime
	crouch's voice faded
	harry looked around the dungeon was dissolving as though it were made of smoke everything was fading he could see only his own body  all else was swirling darkness
	and then, the dungeon returned
	harry was sitting in a different seat, still on the highest bench, but now to the left side of mr
	the atmosphere seemed quite different relaxed, even cheerful
	the witches and wizards all around the walls were talking to one another, almost as though they were at some sort of sporting event
	harry noticed a witch halfway up the rows of benches opposite
	she had short blonde hair, was wearing magenta robes, and was sucking the end of an acidgreen quill
	it was, unmistakably, a younger rita skeeter
	harry looked around dumbledore was sitting beside him again, wearing different robes
	crouch looked more tired and somehow fiercer, gaunter
	it was a different memory, a different day
	the door in the corner opened, and ludo bagman walked into the room
	this was not, however, a ludo bagman gone to seed, but a ludo bagman who was clearly at the height of his quidditchplaying fitness
	his nose wasn't broken now he was tall and lean and muscular
	bagman looked nervous as he sat down in the chained chair, but it did not bind him there as it had bound karkaroff, and bagman, perhaps taking heart from this, glanced around at the watching crowd, waved at a couple of them, and managed a small smile
	ludo bagman, you have been brought here in front of the council of magical law to answer charges relating to the activities of the death eaters, said mr
	we have heard the evidence against you, and are about to reach our verdict
	do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce judgmentharry couldn't believe his ears
	ludo bagman, a death eateronly, said bagman, smiling awkwardly, well  i know i've been a bit of an idiot one or two wizards and witches in the surrounding seats smiled indulgently
	crouch did not appear to share their feelings
	he was staring down at ludo bagman with an expression of the utmost severity and dislike
	you never spoke a truer word, boy, someone muttered dryly to dumbledore behind harry
	he looked around and saw moody sitting there again
	if i didn't know he'd always been dim, i'd have said some of those bludgers had permanently affected his brain
	ludovic bagman, you were caught passing information to lord voldemort's supporters, said mr
	for this, i suggest a term of imprisonment in azkaban lasting no less than but there was an angry outcry from the surrounding benches
	several of the witches and wizards around the walls stood up, shaking their heads, and even their fists, at mr
	but i've told you, i had no idea  bagman called earnestly over the crowd's babble, his round blue eyes widening
	none at all old rookwood was a friend of my dad's
	never crossed my mind he was in with youknowwho  i thought i was collecting information for our side  and rookwood kept talking about getting me a job in the ministry later on
	once my quidditch days are over, you know
	i mean, i can't keep getting hit by bludgers for the rest of my life, can ithere were titters from the crowd
	it will be put to the vote, said mr
	he turned to the righthand side of the dungeon
	the jury will please raise their hands
	those in favor of imprisonment
	harry looked toward the righthand side of the dungeon
	not one person raised their hand
	many of the witches and wizards around the walls began to clap
	one of the witches on the jury stood up
	we'd just like to congratulate mr
	bagman on his splendid performance for england in the quidditch match against turkey last saturday, the witch said breathlessly
	crouch looked furious
	the dungeon was ringing with applause now
	bagman got to his feet and bowed, beaming
	crouch spat at dumbledore, sitting down as bagman walked out of the dungeon
	rookwood get him a job indeed
	the day ludo bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the ministry
	and the dungeon dissolved again
	when it had returned, harry looked around
	he and dumbledore were still sitting beside mr
	crouch, but the atmosphere could not have been more different
	there was total silence, broken only by the dry sobs of a frail, wispylooking witch in the seat next to mr
	she was clutching a handkerchief to her mouth with trembling hands
	harry looked up at crouch and saw that he looked gaunter and grayer than ever before
	a nerve was twitching in his temple
	bring them in, he said, and his voice echoed through the silent dungeon
	the door in the corner opened yet again
	six dementors entered this time, flanking a group of four people
	harry saw the people in the crowd turn to look up at mr
	a few of them whispered to one another
	the dementors placed each of the four people in the four chairs with chained arms that now stood on the dungeon floor
	there was a thickset man who stared blankly up at crouch a thinner and more nervouslooking man, whose eyes were darting around the crowd a woman with thick, shining dark hair and heavily hooded eyes, who was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a throne and a boy in his late teens, who looked nothing short of petrified
	he was shivering, his strawcolored hair all over his face, his freckled skin milkwhite
	the wispy little witch beside  crouch began to rock backward and forward in her seat, whimpering into her handkerchief
	he looked down upon the four in front of him, and there was pure hatred in his face
	you have been brought here before the council of magical law, he said clearly, so that we may pass judgment on you, for a crime so heinous father, said the boy with the strawcolored hair
	that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court, said crouch, speaking more loudly, drowning out his son's voice
	we have heard the evidence against you
	the four of you stand accused of capturing an auror  frank longbottom  and subjecting him to the cruciatus curse, believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master, hewhomustnotbenamed father, i didn't  shrieked the boy in chains below
	i didn't, i swear it
	father, don't send me back to the dementors you are further accused, bellowed mr
	crouch, of using the cruciatus curse on frank longbottom's wife, when he would not give you information
	you planned to restore hewhomustnotbenamed to power, and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong
	i now ask the jury mother screamed the boy below, and the wispy little witch beside crouch began to sob, rocking backward and forward
	mother, i didn't do it, it wasn't mei now ask the jury, shouted mr
	crouch, to raise their hands if they believe, as i do, that these crimes deserve a life sentence in azkabanin unison, the witches and wizards along the righthand side of the dungeon raised their hands
	the crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for bagman, their faces full of savage triumph
	the boy began to scream
	no  mother, no  i didn't do it, i didn't do it, i didn't know  don't send me there, don't let himthe dementors were gliding back into the room
	the boys' three companions rose quietly from their seats the woman with the heavylidded eyes looked up at crouch and called, the dark lord will rise again, crouch  throw us into azkaban we will wait  hewill rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters  we alone were faithful  we alone tried to find himbut the boy was trying to fight off the dementors, even though harry could see their cold, draining power starting to affect him
	the crowd was jeering, some of them on their feet, as the woman swept out of the dungeon, and the boy continued to struggle
	i'm your son he screamed up at crouch
	i'm your sonyou are no son of mine bellowed mr
	crouch, his eyes bulging suddenly
	i have no sonthe wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp and slumped in her seat
	crouch appeared not to have noticed
	take them away crouch roared at the dementors, spit flying from his mouth
	take them away, and may they rot therefather  father, i wasn't involved  no  no  father, pleasei think
	harry, it is time to return to my office, said a quiet voice in harrys ear
	then he looked on his other side
	there was an albus dumbledore sitting on his right, watching crouch's son being dragged away by the dementors  and there was an albus dumbledore on his left, looking right at him
	come, said the dumbledore on his left, and he put his hand under harrys elbow
	harry felt himself rising into the air the dungeon dissolved around him for a moment, all was blackness, and then he felt as though he had done a slowmotion somersault, suddenly landing flat on his feet, in what seemed like the dazzling light of dumbledore's sunlit office
	the stone basin was shimmering in the cabinet in front of him, and albus dumbledore was standing beside him
	professor, harry gasped, i know i shouldn't've  i didn't mean  the cabinet door was sort of open and i quite understand, said dumbledore
	he lifted the basin, carried it over to his desk, placed it upon the polished top, and sat down in the chair behind it
	he motioned for harry to sit down opposite him
	harry did so, staring at the stone basin
	the contents had returned to their original, silverywhite state, swirling and rippling beneath his gaze
	what is it harry asked shakily
	this  it is called a pensieve, said dumbledore
	i sometimes find, and i am sure you know the feeling, that i simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind
	er, said harry, who couldn't truthfully say that he had ever felt anything of the sort
	at these times, said dumbledore, indicating the stone basin, i use the pensieve
	one simply siphons the excess thoughts from one's mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one's leisure
	it becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form
	that stuff's your thoughts  harry said, staring at the swirling white substance in the basin
	certainly, said dumbledore
	dumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip into his own silvery hair, near his temple
	when he took the wand away, hair seemed to be clinging to it  but then harry saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange silverywhite substance that filled the pensieve
	dumbledore added this fresh thought to the basin, and harry, astonished, saw his own face swimming around the surface of the bowl
	dumbledore placed his long hands on either side of the pensieve and swirled it, rather as a gold prospector would pan for fragments of gold
	and harry saw his own face change smoothly into snape's, who opened his mouth and spoke to the ceiling, his voice echoing slightly
	stronger and clearer than ever
	a connection i could have made without assistance, dumbledore sighed, but never mind
	he peered over the top of his halfmoon spectacles at harry, who was gaping at snape's face, which was continuing to swirl around the bowl
	i was using the pensieve when mr
	fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather hastily
	undoubtedly i did not fasten the cabinet door properly
	naturally, it would have attracted your attention
	i'm sorry, harry mumbled
	dumbledore shook his head
	curiosity is not a sin, he said
	but we should exercise caution with our curiosity
	frowning slightly, he prodded the thoughts within the basin with the tip of his wand
	instantly, a figure rose out of it, a plump, scowling girl of about sixteen, who began to revolve slowly, with her feet still in the basin
	she took no notice whatsoever of harry or professor dumbledore
	when she spoke, her voice echoed as snape's had done, as though it were coming from the depths of the stone basin
	he put a hex on me, professor dumbledore, and iwas only teasing him, sir, i only said i'd seen him kissing florence behind the greenhouses last thursday
	bertha, said dumbledore sadly, looking up at the now silently revolving girl, why did you have to follow him in the first placebertha harry whispered, looking up at her
	is that  was that bertha jorkinsyes, said dumbledore, prodding the thoughts in the basin again bertha sank back into them, and they became silvery and opaque once more
	that was bertha as i remember her at school
	the silvery light from the pensieve illuminated dumbledore's face, and it struck harry suddenly how very old he was looking
	he knew, of course, that dumbledore was getting on in years, but somehow he never really thought of dumbledore as an old man
	so, harry, said dumbledore quietly
	before you got lost in my thoughts, you wanted to tell me something
	professor  i was in divination just now, and  er  i fell asleep
	he hesitated here, wondering if a reprimand was coming, but dumbledore merely said, quite understandable
	well, i had a dream, said harry
	a dream about lord voldemort
	he was torturing wormtail
	you know who wormtaili do know, said dumbledore promptly
	voldemort got a letter from an owl
	he said something like, wormtail's blunder had been repaired
	he said someone was dead
	then he said, wormtail wouldn't be fed to the snake  there was a snake beside his chair
	he said  he said he'd be feeding me to it,instead
	then he did the cruciatus curse on wormtail  and my scar hurt, harry said
	it woke me up, it hurt so badly
	dumbledore merely looked at him
	er  that's all, said harry
	i see, said dumbledore quietly
	now, has your scar hurt at any other time this year, excepting the time it woke you up over the summerno, i  how did you know it woke me up over the summer said harry, astonished
	you are not sirius's only correspondent, said dumbledore
	i have also been in contact with him ever since he left hogwarts last year
	it was i who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay
	dumbledore got up and began walking up and down behind his desk
	every now and then, he placed his wand tip to his temple, removed another shining silver thought, and added it to the pensieve
	the thoughts inside began to swirl so fast that harry couldn't make out anything clearly  it was merely a blur of color
	professor  he said quietly, after a couple of minutes
	dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at harry
	my apologies, he said quietly
	he sat back down at his desk
	d'you  d'you know why my scar's hurting medumbledore looked very intently at harry for a moment, and then said, i have a theory, no more than that
	it is my belief that your scar hurts both when lord voldemort is near you, and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred
	whybecause you and he are connected by the curse that failed, said dumbledore
	that is no ordinary scar
	did it really happenit is possible, said dumbledore
	i would say  probable
	harry  did you see voldemortno, said harry
	just the back of his chair
	but  there wouldn't have been anything to see, would there  i mean, he hasn't got a body, has he  but
	but then how could he have held the wand  harry said slowly
	how indeed muttered dumbledore
	neither dumbledore nor harry spoke for a while
	dumbledore was gazing across the room, and, every now and then, placing his wand tip to his temple and adding another shining silver thought to the seething mass within the pensieve
	professor, harry said at last, do you think he's getting strongervoldemort said dumbledore, looking at harry over the pensieve
	it was the characteristic, piercing look  dumbledore had given him on other occasions, and always made harry feel as though dumbledore were seeing right through him in a way that even moody's magical eye could not
	harry, i can only give you my suspicions
	dumbledore sighed again, and he looked older, and wearier, than ever
	the years of voldemort's ascent to power, he said, were marked with disappearances
	bertha jorkins has vanished without a trace in the place where voldemort was certainly known to be last
	crouch too has disappeared
	within these very grounds
	and there was a third disappearance, one which the ministry, i regret to say, do not consider of any importance, for it concerns a muggle
	his name was frank bryce, he lived in the village where voldemort's father grew up, and he has not been seen since last august
	you see, i read the muggle newspapers, unlike most of my ministry friends
	dumbledore looked very seriously at harry
	these disappearances seem to me to be linked
	the ministry disagrees  as you may have heard, while waiting outside my office
	silence fell between them again, dumbledore extracting thoughts every now and then
	harry felt as though he ought to go, but his curiosity held him in his chair
	professor  he said again
	yes, harry  said dumbledore
	could i ask you about
	that court thing i was in
	in the pensieveyou could, said dumbledore heavily
	i attended it many times, but some trials come back to me more clearly than others
	you know  you know the trial you found me in  the one with crouch's son  well
	were they talking about neville's parentsdumbledore gave harry a very sharp look
	has neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother he said
	harry shook his head, wondering, as he did so, how he could have failed to ask neville this, in almost four years of knowing him
	yes, they were talking about nevilles parents, said dumbledore
	his father, frank, was an auror just like professor moody
	he and his wife were tortured for information about voldemort's whereabouts after he lost his powers, as you heard
	so they're dead said harry quietly
	no, said dumbledore, his voice full of a bitterness harry had never heard there before
	they are both in st
	mungo's hospital for magical maladies and injuries
	i believe neville visits them, with his grandmother, during the holidays
	they do not recognize him
	harry sat there, horrorstruck
	never, in four years, bothered to find out
	the longbottoms were very popular, said dumbledore
	the attacks on them came after voldemort's fall from power, just when everyone thought they were safe
	those attacks caused a wave of fury such as i have never known
	the ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it
	unfortunately, the longbottoms' evidence was  given their condition  none too reliable
	crouch's son might not have been involved said harry slowly
	dumbledore shook his head
	as to that, i have no idea
	harry sat in silence once more, watching the contents of the pensieve swirl
	there were two more questions he was burning to ask
	but they concerned the guilt of living people
	has never been accused of any dark activity since, said dumbledore calmly
	right, said harry hastily, staring at the contents of the pensieve again, which were swirling more slowly now that dumbledore had stopped adding thoughts
	but the pensieve seemed to be asking his question for him
	snape's face was swimming on the surface again
	dumbledore glanced down into it, and then up at harry
	no more has professor snape, he said
	harry looked into dumbledore's light blue eyes, and the thing he really wanted to know spilled out of his mouth before he could stop it
	what made you think he'd really stopped supporting voldemort, professordumbledore held harrys gaze for a few seconds, and then said, that, harry, is a matter between professor snape and myself
	harry knew that the interview was over dumbledore did not look angry, yet there was a finality in his tone that told harry it was time to go
	he stood up, and so did dumbledore
	harry, he said as harry reached the door
	please do not speak about neville's parents to anybody else
	he has the right to let people know, when he is ready
	yes, professor, said harry, turning to go
	dumbledore was standing over the pensieve, his face lit from beneath by its silvery spots of light, looking older than ever
	he stared at harry for a moment, and then said, good luck with the third task
	chapter thirtyone  the third taskdumbledore reckons youknowwho's getting stronger again as well  ron whispered
	everything harry had seen in the pensieve, nearly everything dumbledore had told and shown him afterward, he had now shared with ron and hermione  and, of course, with sirius, to whom harry had sent an owl the moment he had left dumbledore's office
	harry, ron, and hermione sat up late in the common room once again that night, talking it all over until harry's mind was reeling, until he understood what dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off
	ron stared into the common room fire
	harry thought he saw ron shiver slightly, even though the evening was warm
	and he trusts snape  ron said
	he really trusts snape, even though he knows he was a death eateryes, said harry
	hermione had not spoken for ten minutes
	she was sitting with her forehead in her hands, staring at her knees
	harry thought she too looked as though she could have done with a pensieve
	rita skeeter, she muttered finally
	how can you be worrying about her now  said ron, in utter disbelief
	i'm not worrying about her, hermione said to her knees
	remember what she said to me in the three broomsticks  'i know things about ludo bagman that would make your hair curl
	' this is what she meant, isn't it  she reported his trial, she knew he'd passed information to the death eaters
	and winky too, remember
	'ludo bagman's a bad wizard
	crouch would have been furious he got off, he would have talked about it at home
	yeah, but bagman didn't pass information on purpose, did hehermione shrugged
	and fudge reckons madame maxime attacked crouch  ron said, turning back to harry
	yeah, said harry, but he's only saying that because crouch disappeared near the beauxbatons carriage
	we never thought of her, did we  said ron slowly
	mind you, she's definitely got giant blood, and she doesn't want to admit itof course she doesn't, said hermione sharply, looking up
	look what happened to hagrid when rita found out about his mother
	look at fudge, jumping to conclusions about her, just because she's part giant
	who needs that sort of prejudice  i'd probably say i had big bones if i knew that's what i'd get for telling the truth
	hermione looked at her watch
	we haven't done any practicing  she said, looking shocked
	we were going to do the impediment curse  we'll have to really get down to it tomorrow  come on
	harry, you need to get some sleep
	harry and ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory
	as harry pulled on his pajamas, he looked over at nevilles bed
	true to his word to dumbledore, he had not told ron and hermione about neville s parents
	as harry took off his glasses and climbed into his fourposter, he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you
	he often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan, but as he listened to nevilles snores, he thought that neville deserved it more than he did
	lying in the darkness, harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured mr
	he remembered the jeers of the crowd as crouch's son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the dementors
	he understood how they had felt
	then he remembered the milkwhite face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later
	it was voldemort, harry thought, staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness, it all came back to voldemort
	he was the one who had torn these families apart, who had ruined all these lives
	ron and hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams, which would finish on the day of the third task, but they were putting most of their efforts into helping harry prepare
	don't worry about it, hermione said shortly when harry pointed this out to them and said he didn't mind practicing on his own for a while, at least we'll get top marks in defense against the dark arts
	we'd never have found out about all these hexes in class
	good training for when we're all aurors, said ron excitedly, attempting the impediment curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it stop dead in midair
	the mood in the castle as they entered june became excited and tense again
	everyone was looking forward to the third task, which would take place a week before the end of term
	harry was practicing hexes at every available moment
	he felt more confident about this task than either of the others
	difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be, moody was right harry had managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now, and this time he had some notice, some chance to prepare himself for what lay ahead
	tired of walking in on harry, hermione, and ron all over the school
	professor mcgonagall had given them permission to use the empty transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes
	harry had soon mastered the impediment curse, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers the reductor curse, which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way and the fourpoint spell, a useful discovery of hermiones that would make his wand point due north, therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze
	he was still having trouble with the shield charm, though
	this was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses hermione managed to shatter it with a wellplaced jellylegs jinx, and harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counterjinx
	you're still doing really well, though, hermione said encouragingly, looking down her list and crossing off those spells they had already learned
	some of these are bound to come in handy
	come and look at this, said ron, who was standing by the window
	he was staring down onto the grounds
	what's malfoy doingharry and hermione went to see
	malfoy, crabbe, and goyle were standing in the shadow of a tree below
	crabbe and goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout both were smirking
	malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into it
	he looks like he's using a walkietalkie, said harry curiously
	he can't be, said hermione, i've told you, those sorts of things don't work around hogwarts
	come on, harry, she added briskly, turning away from the window and moving back into the middle of the room, let's try that shield charm again
	sirius was sending daily owls now
	like hermione, he seemed to want to concentrate on getting harry through the last task before they concerned themselves with anything else
	he reminded harry in every letter that whatever might be going on outside the walls of hogwarts was not harry's responsibility, nor was it within his power to influence it
	if voldemort is really getting stronger again, he wrote, my priority is to ensure your safety
	he cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are under dumbledore's protection, but all the same, take no risks concentrate on getting through that maze safely, and then we can turn our attention to other matters
	harry's nerves mounted as june the twentyfourth drew closer, but they were not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks
	for one thing, he was confident that, this time, he had done everything in his power to prepare for the task
	for another, this was the final hurdle, and however well or badly he did, the tournament would at last be over, which would be an enormous relief
	breakfast was a very noisy affair at the gryffindor table on the morning of the third task
	the post owls appeared, bringing harry a goodluck card from sirius
	it was only a piece of parchment, folded over and bearing a muddy paw print on its front, but harry appreciated it all the same
	a screech owl arrived for hermione, carrying her morning copy of the daily prophet as usual
	she unfolded the paper, glanced at the front page, and spat out a mouthful of pumpkin juice all over it
	what said harry and ron together, staring at her
	nothing, said hermione quickly, trying to shove the paper out of sight, but ron grabbed it
	he stared at the headline and said, no way
	rita skeeter again no, said ron, and just like hermione, he attempted to push the paper out of sight
	it's about me, isn't it said harry
	no, said ron, in an entirely unconvincing tone
	but before harry could demand to see the paper
	draco malfoy shouted across the great hall from the slytherin table
	hey, potter  potter  how's your head  you feeling all right  sure you're not going to go berserk on usmalfoy was holding a copy of the daily prophet too
	slytherins up and down the table were sniggering, twisting in their seats to see harry's reaction
	let me see it, harry said to ron
	very reluctantly, ron handed over the newspaper
	harry turned it over and found himself staring at his own picture, beneath the banner headlineharry potter disturbed and dangerousthe boy who defeated hewhomustnotbenamed is unstable and possibly dangerous, writes rita skeeter, special correspondent
	alarming evidence has recently come to light about harry potter's strange behavior, which casts doubts upon his suitability to compete in a demanding competition like the triwizard tournament, or even to attend hogwarts school
	potter, the daily prophet can exclusively reveal, regularly collapses at school, and is often heard to complain of pain in the scar on his forehead relic of the curse with which youknowwho attempted to kill him
	on monday last, midway through a divination lesson, your daily prophet reporter witnessed potter storming from the class, claiming that his scar was hurting too badly to continue studying
	it is possible, say top experts at st
	mungo's hospital for magical maladies and injuries, that potters brain was affected by the attack inflicted upon him by youknowwho, and that his insistence that the scar is still hurting is an expression of his deepseated confusion
	he might even be pretending, said one specialist
	this could be a plea for attention
	the daily prophet, however, has unearthed worrying facts about harry potter that albus dumbledore, headmaster of hogwarts, has carefully concealed from the wizarding public
	potter can speak parseltongue, reveals draco malfoy, a hogwarts fourth year
	there were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago, and most people thought potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy
	it was all hushed up, though
	but he's made friends with werewolves and giants too
	we think he'd do anything for a bit of power
	parseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has long been considered a dark art
	indeed, the most famous parselmouth of our times is none other than youknowwho himself
	a member of the dark force defense league, who wished to remain unnamed, stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak parseltongue as worthy of investigation
	personally, i would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes, as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of dark magic, and are historically associated with evildoers
	similarly, anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence
	albus dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the triwizard tournament
	some fear that potter might resort to the dark arts in his desperation to win the tournament, the third task of which takes place this evening
	gone off me a bit, hasn't she  said harry lightly, folding up the paper
	over at the slytherin table, malfoy, crabbe, and goyle were laughing at him, tapping their heads with their fingers, pulling grotesquely mad faces, and waggling their tongues like snakes
	how did she know your scar hurt in divination ron said
	there's no way she was there, there's no way she could've heard the window was open, said harry
	i opened it to breathe
	you were at the top of north tower  hermione said
	your voice couldn't have carried all the way down to the groundswell, you're the one who's supposed to be researching magical methods of bugging said harry
	you tell me how she did iti've been trying  said hermione
	an odd, dreamy expression suddenly came over hermione's face
	she slowly raised a hand and ran her fingers through her hair
	are you all right said ron, frowning at her
	yes, said hermione breathlessly
	she ran her fingers through her hair again, and then held her hand up to her mouth, as though speaking into an invisible walkietalkie
	harry and ron stared at each other
	i've had an idea, hermione said, gazing into space
	because then no one would be able to see
	and she'd have been able to get onto the window ledge
	but she's not allowed
	she's definitely not allowed
	i think we've got her  just give me two seconds in the library  just to make surewith that, hermione seized her school bag and dashed out of the great hall
	oi ron called after her
	we've got our history of magic exam in ten minutes blimey, he said, turning back to harry, she must really hate that skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam
	what're you going to do in binns's class  read againexempt from the endofterm tests as a triwizard champion, harry had been sitting in the back of every exam class so far, looking up fresh hexes for the third task
	s'pose so, harry said to ron but just then
	professor mcgonagall came walking alongside the gryffindor table toward him
	potter, the champions are congregating in the chamber off the hall after breakfast, she said
	but the task's not till tonight  said harry, accidentally spilling scrambled eggs down his front, afraid he had mistaken the time
	i'm aware of that, potter, she said
	the champions' families are invited to watch the final task, you know
	this is simply a chance for you to greet them
	harry gaped after her
	she doesn't expect the dursleys to turn up, does she  he asked ron blankly
	harry, i'd better hurry, i'm going to be late for binns
	harry finished his breakfast in the emptying great hall
	he saw fleur delacour get up from the ravenclaw table and join cedric as he crossed to the side chamber and entered
	krum slouched off to join them shortly afterward
	harry stayed where he was
	he really didn't want to go into the chamber
	he had no family  no family who would turn up to see him risk his life, anyway
	but just as he was getting up, thinking that he might as well go up to the library and do a spot more hex research, the door of the side chamber opened, and cedric stuck his head out
	harry, come on, they're waiting for youutterly perplexed
	the dursleys couldn't possibly be here, could they he walked across the hall and opened the door into the chamber
	cedric and his parents were just inside the door
	viktor krum was over in a corner, conversing with his darkhaired mother and father in rapid bulgarian
	he had inherited his fathers hooked nose
	on the other side of the room, fleur was jabbering away in french to her mother
	fleur's little sister, gabrielle, was holding her mother's hand
	she waved at harry, who waved back, grinning
	weasley and bill standing in front of the fireplace, beaming at him
	weasley said excitedly as he smiled broadly and walked over to them
	thought we'd come and watch you
	harry  she bent down and kissed him on the cheek
	you all right said bill, grinning at harry and shaking his hand
	charlie wanted to come, but he couldn't get time off
	he said you were incredible against the horntail
	fleur delacour, harry noticed, was eyeing bill with great interest over her mother's shoulder
	harry could tell she had no objection whatsoever to long hair or earrings with fangs on them
	this is really nice of you, harry muttered to mrs
	i thought for a moment  the dursleys hmm, said mrs
	weasley, pursing her lips
	she had always refrained from criticizing the dursleys in front of harry, but her eyes flashed every time they were mentioned
	it's great being back here, said bill, looking around the chamber violet, the fat lady's friend, winked at him from her frame
	haven't seen this place for five years
	is that picture of the mad knight still around  sir cadoganoh yeah, said harry, who had met sir cadogan the previous year
	and the fat lady said bill
	she was here in my time, said mrs
	she gave me such a telling off one night when i got back to the dormitory at four in the morning what were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning  said bill, surveying his mother with amazement
	weasley grinned, her eyes twinkling
	your father and i had been for a nighttime stroll, she said
	he got caught by apollyon pringle  he was the caretaker in those days  your father's still got the marks
	fancy giving us a tour, harry  said bill
	yeah, okay, said harry, and they made their way back toward the door into the great hall
	as they passed amos diggory, he looked around
	there you are, are you he said, looking harry up and down
	bet you're not feeling quite as full of yourself now cedrics caught you up on points, are youwhat said harry
	ignore him, said cedric in a low voice to harry, frowning after his father
	he's been angry ever since rita skeeters article about the triwizard tournament  you know, when she made out you were the only hogwarts champion
	didn't bother to correct her, though, did he  said amos diggory, loudly enough for harry to hear as he started to walk out of the door with mrs
	you'll show him, ced
	beaten him once before, haven't yourita skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble, amos  mrs
	weasley said angrily
	i would have thought you'd know that, working at the ministrymr
	diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry, but his wife laid a hand on his arm, and he merely shrugged and turned away
	harry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the sunny grounds with bill and mrs
	weasley, showing them the beauxbatons carriage and the durmstrang ship
	weasley was intrigued by the whomping willow, which had been planted after she had left school, and reminisced at length about the gamekeeper before hagrid, a man called ogg
	how's percy  harry asked as they walked around the greenhouses
	he's very upset, said mrs
	weasley, lowering her voice and glancing around
	the ministry wants to keep mr
	crouch's disappearance quiet, but percy's been hauled in for questioning about the instructions mr
	crouch has been sending in
	they seem to think there's a chance they weren't genuinely written by him
	percy's been under a lot of strain
	they're not letting him fill in for mr
	crouch as the fifth judge tonight
	cornelius fudge is going to be doing it
	they returned to the castle for lunch
	mum  bill said ron, looking stunned, as he joined the gryffindor table
	what're you doing herecome to watch harry in the last task  said mrs
	i must say, it makes a lovely change, not having to cook
	how was your examoh
	couldn't remember all the goblin rebels' names, so i invented a few
	it's all right, he said, helping himself to a cornish pasty, while mrs
	weasley looked stern, they're all called stuff like bodrod the bearded and urg the unclean it wasn't hard
	fred, george, and ginny came to sit next to them too, and harry was having such a good time he felt almost as though he were back at the burrow he had forgotten to worry about that evening's task, and not until hermione turned up, halfway through lunch, did he remember that she had had a brainwave about rita skeeter
	are you going to tell us  hermione shook her head warningly and glanced at mrs
	hello, hermione, said mrs
	weasley, much more stiffly than usual
	hello, said hermione, her smile faltering at the cold expression on mrs
	harry looked between them, then said, mrs
	weasley, you didn't believe that rubbish rita skeeter wrote in witch weekly, did you  because hermione's not my girlfriend
	weasley no  of course i didn'tbut she became considerably warmer toward hermione after that
	weasley whiled away the afternoon with a long walk around the castle, and then returned to the great hall for the evening feast
	ludo bagman and cornelius fudge had joined the staff table now
	bagman looked quite cheerful, but cornelius fudge, who was sitting next to madame maxime, looked stern and was not talking
	madame maxime was concentrating on her plate, and harry thought her eyes looked red
	hagrid kept glancing along the table at her,there were more courses than usual, but harry, who was starting to feel really nervous now, didn't eat much
	as the enchanted ceiling overhead began to fade from blue to a dusky purple, dumbledore rose to his feet at the staff table, and silence fell
	ladies and gentlemen, in five minutes' time, i will be asking you to make your way down to the quidditch field for the third and final task of the triwizard tournament
	will the champions please follow mr
	bagman down to the stadium now
	the gryffindors all along the table were applauding him the weasleys and hermione all wished him good luck, and he headed off out of the great hall with cedric, fleur, and viktor
	harry bagman asked as they went down the stone steps onto the grounds
	confidenti'm okay, said harry
	it was sort of true he was nervous, but he kept running over all the hexes and spells he had been practicing in his mind as they walked, and the knowledge that he could remember them all made him feel better
	they walked onto the quidditch field, which was now completely unrecognizable
	a twentyfoothigh hedge ran all the way around the edge of it
	there was a gap right in front of them  the entrance to the vast maze
	the passage beyond it looked dark and creepy
	five minutes later, the stands had begun to fill the air was full of excited voices and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their seats
	the sky was a deep, clear blue now, and the first stars were starting to appear
	hagrid, professor moody, professor mcgonagall, and professor flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached bagman and the champions
	they were wearing large, red, luminous stars on their hats, all except hagrid, who had his on the back of his moleskin vest
	we are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze, said professor mcgonagall to the champions
	if you get into difficulty, and wish to be rescued, send red sparks into the air, and one of us will come and get you, do you understandthe champions nodded
	off you go, then  said bagman brightly to the four patrollers
	harry, hagrid whispered, and the four of them walked away in different directions, to station themselves around the maze
	bagman now pointed his wand at his throat, muttered, sonorus, and his magically magnified voice echoed into the stands
	ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the triwizard tournament is about to begin  let me remind you how the points currently stand  tied in first place, with eightyfive points each  mr
	cedric diggory and mr
	harry potter, both of hogwarts school  the cheers and applause sent birds from the forbidden forest fluttering into the darkening sky
	in second place, with eighty points  mr
	viktor krum, of durmstrang institute  more applause
	and in third place  miss fleur delacour, of beauxbatons academyharry could just make out mrs
	weasley, bill, ron, and hermione applauding fleur politely, halfway up the stands
	he waved up at them, and they waved back, beaming at him
	on my whistle, harry and cedric said bagman
	three  two  one he gave a short blast on his whistle, and harry and cedric hurried forward into the maze
	the towering hedges cast black shadows across the path, and, whether because they were so tall and thick or because they had been enchanted, the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze
	harry felt almost as though he were underwater again
	he pulled out his wand, muttered, lumos, and heard cedric do the same just behind him
	after about fifty yards, they reached a fork
	they looked at each other
	see you, harry said, and he took the left one, while cedric took the right
	harry heard bagman's whistle for the second time
	krum had entered the maze
	his chosen path seemed completely deserted
	he turned right, and hurried on, holding his wand high over his head, trying to see as far ahead as possible
	still, there was nothing in sight
	bagman's whistle blew in the distance for the third time
	all of the champions were now inside
	harry kept looking behind him
	the old feeling that he was being watched was upon him
	the maze was growing darker with every passing minute as the sky overhead deepened to navy
	he reached a second fork
	point me, he whispered to his wand, holding it flat in his palm
	the wand spun around once and pointed toward his right, into solid hedge
	that way was north, and he knew that he needed to go northwest for the center of the maze
	the best he could do was to take the left fork and go right again as soon as possible
	the path ahead was empty too, and when harry reached a right turn and took it, he again found his way unblocked
	harry didn't know why, but the lack of obstacles was unnerving him
	surely he should have met something by now  it felt as though the maze were luring him into a false sense of security
	then he heard movement right behind him
	he held out his wand, ready to attack, but its beam fell only upon cedric, who had just hurried out of a path on the righthand side
	cedric looked severely shaken
	the sleeve of his robe was smoking
	hagrid's blastended skrewts he hissed
	they're enormous  i only just got awayhe shook his head and dived out of sight, along another path
	keen to put plenty of distance between himself and the skrewts, harry hurried off again
	then, as he turned a corner, he saw
	a dementor gliding toward him
	twelve feet tall, its face hidden by its hood, its rotting, scabbed hands outstretched, it advanced, sensing its way blindly toward him
	harry could hear its rattling breath he felt clammy coldness stealing over him, but knew what he had to do
	he summoned the happiest thought he could, concentrated with all his might on the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with ron and hermione, raised his wand, and cried, expecto patronuma silver stag erupted from the end of harry's wand and galloped toward the dementor, which fell back and tripped over the hem of its robes
	harry had never seen a dementor stumble
	hang on  he shouted, advancing in the wake of his silver patronus, you're a boggart riddikulusthere was a loud crack, and the shapeshifter exploded in a wisp of smoke
	the silver stag faded from sight
	harry wished it could have stayed, he could have used some company
	but he moved on, quickly and quietly as possible, listening hard, his wand held high once more
	twice he found himself facing dead ends
	he did the fourpoint spell again and found that he was going too far east
	he turned back, took a right turn, and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead of him
	harry approached it cautiously, pointing the wand's beam at it
	this looked like some kind of enchantment
	he wondered whether he might be able to blast it out of the way
	the spell shot straight through the mist, leaving it intact
	he supposed he should have known better the reductor curse was for solid objects
	what would happen if he walked through the mist  was it worth chancing it, or should he double backhe was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence
	he stared all around him
	what had happened to her  her scream seemed to have come from somewhere ahead
	he took a deep breath and ran through the enchanted mist
	the world turned upside down
	harry was hanging from the ground, with his hair on end, his glasses dangling off his nose, threatening to fall into the bottomless sky
	he clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there, terrified
	it felt as though his feet were glued to the grass, which had now become the ceiling
	below him the dark, starspangled heavens stretched endlessly
	he felt as though if he tried to move one of his feet, he would fall away from the earth completely
	think, he told himself, as all the blood rushed to his head, think
	but not one of the spells he had practiced had been designed to combat a sudden reversal of ground and sky
	did he dare move his foot  he could hear the blood pounding in his ears
	he had two choices  try and move, or send up red sparks, and get rescued and disqualified from the task
	he shut his eyes, so he wouldn't be able to see the view of endless space below him, and pulled his right foot as hard as he could away from the grassy ceiling
	immediately, the world righted itself
	harry fell forward onto his knees onto the wonderfully solid ground
	he felt temporarily limp with shock
	he took a deep, steadying breath, then got up again and hurried forward, looking back over his shoulder as he ran away from the golden mist, which twinkled innocently at him in the moonlight
	he paused at a junction of two paths and looked around for some sign of fleur
	he was sure it had been she who had screamed
	what had she met  was she all right  there was no sign of red sparks  did that mean she had got herself out of trouble, or was she in such trouble that she couldn't reach her wand  harry took the right fork with a feeling of increasing unease
	but at the same time, he couldn't help thinking
	the cup was somewhere close by, and it sounded as though fleur was no longer in the running
	he'd got this far, hadn't he  what if he actually managed to win  fleetingly, and for the first time since he'd found himself champion, he saw again that image of himself, raising the triwizard cup in front of the rest of the school
	he met nothing for ten minutes, but kept running into dead ends
	twice he took the same wrong turning
	finally, he found a new route and started to jog along it, his wandlight waving, making his shadow flicker and distort on the hedge walls
	then he rounded another corner and found himself facing a blastended skrewt
	cedric was right  it was enormous
	ten feet long, it looked more like a giant scorpion than anything
	its long sting was curled over its back
	its thick armor glinted in the light from harry's wand, which he pointed at it
	stupefythe spell hit the skrewt's armor and rebounded harry ducked just in time, but could smell burning hair it had singed the top of his head
	the skrewt issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him
	impedimenta  harry yelled
	the spell hit the skrewt's armor again and ricocheted off harry staggered back a few paces and fell over
	impedimentathe skrewt was inches from him when it froze  he had managed to hit it on its fleshy, shellless underside
	panting, harry pushed himself away from it and ran, hard, in the opposite direction  the impediment curse was not permanent the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment
	he took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another forcing himself to stop, heart hammering, he performed the fourpoint spell again, backtracked, and chose a path that would take him northwest
	he had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes, when he heard something in the path running parallel to his own that made him stop dead
	what are you doing yelled cedric's voice
	what the hell d'you think you're doingand then harry heard krum's voice
	cruciothe air was suddenly full of cedric's yells
	horrified, harry began sprinting up his path, trying to find a way into cedric's
	when none appeared, he tried the reductor curse again
	it wasn't very effective, but it burned a small hole in the hedge through which harry forced his leg, kicking at the thick brambles and branches until they broke and made an opening he struggled through it, tearing his robes, and looking to his right, saw cedric jerking and twitching on the ground, krum standing over him
	harry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at krum just as krum looked up
	krum turned and began to run
	stupefy  harry yelled
	the spell hit krum in the back he stopped dead in his tracks, fell forward, and lay motionless, facedown in the grass
	harrydashed over to cedric, who had stopped twitching and was lying there panting, his hands over his face
	are you all right  harry said roughly, grabbing cedric's arm
	he crept up behind me
	i heard him, i turned around, and he had his wand on me
	he was still shaking
	he and harry looked down at krum
	i can't believe this
	i thought he was all right, harry said, staring at krum
	so did i, said cedric
	did you hear fleur scream earlier  said harry
	you don't think krum got her tooi don't know, said harry slowly
	should we leave him here cedric muttered
	i reckon we should send up red sparks
	someone'll come and collect him
	otherwise he'll probably be eaten by a skrewt
	he'd deserve it, cedric muttered, but all the same, he raised his wand and shot a shower of red sparks into the air, which hovered high above krum, marking the spot where he lay
	harry and cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment, looking around them
	then cedric said, well
	i s'pose we'd better go on
	he and cedric had been briefly united against krum  now the fact that they were opponents came back to harry
	the two of them proceeded up the dark path without speaking, then harry turned left, and cedric right
	cedric's footsteps soon died away
	harry moved on, continuing to use the fourpoint spell, making sure he was moving in the right direction
	it was between him and cedric now
	his desire to reach the cup first was now burning stronger than ever, but he could hardly believe what he'd just seen krum do
	the use of an unforgivable curse on a fellow human being meant a life term in azkaban, that was what moody had told them
	krum surely couldn't have wanted the triwizard cup that badly
	every so often he hit more dead ends, but the increasing darkness made him feel sure he was getting near the heart of the maze
	then, as he strode down a long, straight path, he saw movement once again, and his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature, one which he had only seen in picture form, in his monster book of monsters
	it had the body of an overlarge lion great clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft
	its head, however, was that of a woman
	she turned her long, almondshaped eyes upon harry as he approached
	he raised his wand, hesitating
	she was not crouching as if to spring, but pacing from side to side of the path, blocking his progress
	then she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice
	you are very near your goal
	the quickest way is past me
	so will you move, please  said harry, knowing what the answer was going to be
	no, she said, continuing to pace
	not unless you can answer my riddle
	answer on your first guess  i let you pass
	answer wrongly  i attack
	remain silent  i will let you walk away from me unscathed
	harry's stomach slipped several notches
	it was hermione who was good at this sort of thing, not him
	he weighed his chances
	if the riddle was too hard, he could keep silent, get away from the sphinx unharmed, and try and find an alternative route to the center
	can i hear the riddlethe sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very middle of the path, and recitedfirst think of the person who lives in disguise,who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies
	next, tell me what's always the last thing to mend,the middle of middle and end of the endand finally give me the sound often heardduring the search for a hardtofind word
	now string them together, and answer me this,which creature would you be unwilling to kissharry gaped at her
	could i have it again
	more slowly he asked tentatively
	she blinked at him, smiled, and repeated the poem
	all the clues add up to a creature i wouldn't want to kiss harry asked
	she merely smiled her mysterious smile
	harry took that for a yes
	harry cast his mind around
	there were plenty of animals he wouldn't want to kiss his immediate thought was a blastended skrewt, but something told him that wasn't the answer
	he'd have to try and work out the clues
	a person in disguise, harry muttered, staring at her, who lies
	that'd be a  an impostor
	no, that's not my guess  a  a spy  i'll come back to that
	could you give me the next clue again, pleaseshe repeated the next lines of the poem
	'the last thing to mend,' harry repeated
	could i have the last bit againshe gave him the last four lines
	'the sound often heard during the search for a hardtofind word,' said harry
	hang on  'er'  er's a soundthe sphinx smiled at him
	said harry, pacing up and down
	a creature i wouldn't want to kiss
	a spiderthe sphinx smiled more broadly
	she got up, stretched her front legs, and then moved aside for him to pass
	thanks said harry, and, amazed at his own brilliance, he dashed forward
	he had to be close now, he had to be
	his wand was telling him he was bang on course as long as he didn't meet anything too horrible, he might have a chance
	harry broke into a run
	he had a choice of paths up ahead
	point me he whispered again to his wand, and it spun around and pointed him to the righthand one
	he dashed up this one and saw light ahead
	the triwizard cup was gleaming on a plinth a hundred yards away
	suddenly a dark figure hurtled out onto the path in front of him
	cedric was going to get there first
	cedric was sprinting as fast as he could toward the cup, and harry knew he would never catch up, cedric was much taller, had much longer legs then harry saw something immense over a hedge to his left, moving quickly along a path that intersected with his own it was moving so fast cedric was about to run into it, and cedric, his eyes on the cup, had not seen it cedric harry bellowed
	on your leftcedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past the thing and avoid colliding with it, but in his haste, he tripped
	harry saw cedric's wand fly out of his hand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and began to bear down upon cedric
	stupefy harry yelled the spell hit the spider's gigantic, hairy black body, but for all the good it did, he might as well have thrown a stone at it the spider jerked, scuttled around, and ran at harry instead
	stupefy  impedimenta  stupefybut it was no use  the spider was either so large, or so magical, that the spells were doing no more than aggravating it
	harry had one horrifying glimpse of eight shining black eyes and razorsharp pincers before it was upon him
	he was lifted into the air in its front legs struggling madly, he tried to kick it his leg connected with the pincers and next moment he was in excruciating pain
	he could hear cedric yelling stupefy too, but his spell had no more effect than harry's  harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once more and shouted expelliarmusit worked  the disarming spell made the spider drop him, but that meant that harry fell twelve feet onto his already injured leg, which crumpled beneath him
	without pausing to think, he aimed high at the spider's underbelly, as he had done with the skrewt, and shouted stupefy''just as cedric yelled the same thing
	the two spells combined did what one alone had not  the spider keeled over sideways, flattening a nearby hedge, and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy legs
	harry he heard cedric shouting
	you all right did it fall on youno, harry called back, panting
	he looked down at his leg
	it was bleeding freely
	he could see some sort of thick, gluey secretion from the spider's pincers on his torn robes
	he tried to get up, but his leg was shaking badly and did not want to support his weight
	he leaned against the hedge, gasping for breath, and looked around
	cedric was standing feet from the triwizard cup, which was gleaming behind him
	take it, then, harry panted to cedric
	but cedric didn't move
	he merely stood there, looking at harry
	then he turned to stare at the cup
	harry saw the longing expression on his face in its golden light
	cedric looked around at harry again, who was now holding onto the hedge to support himself
	cedric took a deep breath
	that's twice you've saved my neck in here
	that's not how it's supposed to work, harry said
	he felt angry his leg was very painful, he was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider, and after all his efforts, cedric had beaten him to it, just as he'd beaten harry to ask cho to the ball
	the one who reaches the cup first gets the points
	i'm telling you, i'm not going to win any races on this leg
	cedric took a few paces nearer to the stunned spider, away from the cup, shaking his head
	stop being noble, said harry irritably
	just take it, then we can get out of here
	cedric watched harry steadying himself, holding tight to the hedge
	you told me about the dragons, cedric said
	i would've gone down in the first task if you hadn't told me what was coming
	i had help on that too, harry snapped, trying to mop up his bloody leg with his robes
	you helped me with the egg  we're square
	i had help on the egg in the first place, said cedric
	we're still square, said harry, testing his leg gingerly it shook violently as he put weight on it he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped him
	you should've got more points on the second task, said cedric mulishly
	you stayed behind to get all the hostages
	i should've done that
	i was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously  said harry bitterly
	just take the cupno, said cedric
	he stepped over the spider's tangled legs to join harry, who stared at him
	he was walking away from the sort of glory hufflepuff house hadn't had in centuries
	he looked as though this was costing him every ounce of resolution he had, but his face was set, his arms were folded, he seemed decided
	harry looked from cedric to the cup
	for one shining moment, he saw himself emerging from the maze, holding it
	he saw himself holding the triwizard cup aloft, heard the roar of the crowd, saw cho's face shining with admiration, more clearly than he had ever seen it before
	and then the picture faded, and he found himself staring at cedric's shadowy, stubborn face
	both of us, harry said
	whatwe'll take it at the same time
	it's still a hogwarts victory
	cedric stared at harry
	he unfolded his arms
	you  you sureyeah, said harry
	we've helped each other out, haven't we  we both got here
	let's just take it together
	for a moment, cedric looked as though he couldn't believe his ears then his face split in a grin
	he grabbed harrys arm below the shoulder and helped harry limp toward the plinth where the cup stood
	when they had reached it, they both held a hand out over one of the cup's gleaming handles
	on three, right said harry
	one  two  three he and cedric both grasped a handle
	instantly, harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel
	his feet had left the ground
	he could not unclench the hand holding the triwizard cup it was pulling him onward in a howl of wind and swirling color, cedric at his side
	chapter thirtytwo  flesh, blood, and boneharry felt his feet slam into the ground his injured leg gave way, and he fell forward his hand let go of the triwizard cup at last
	cedric shook his head
	he got up, pulled harry to his feet, and they looked around
	they had left the hogwarts grounds completely they had obviously traveled miles  perhaps hundreds of miles  for even the mountains surrounding the castle were gone
	they were standing instead in a dark and overgrown graveyard the black outline of a small church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right
	a hill rose above them to their left
	harry could just make out the outline of a fine old house on the hillside
	cedric looked down at the triwizard cup and then up at harry
	did anyone tell you the cup was a portkey he asked
	he was looking around the graveyard
	it was completely silent and slightly eerie
	is this supposed to be part of the taski dunno, said cedric
	he sounded slightly nervous
	wands out, d'you reckonyeah, said harry, glad that cedric had made the suggestion rather than him
	they pulled out their wands
	harry kept looking around him
	he had, yet again, the strange feeling that they were being watched
	someone's coming, he said suddenly
	squinting tensely through the darkness, they watched the figure drawing nearer, walking steadily toward them between the graves
	harry couldn't make out a face, but from the way it was walking and holding its arms, he could tell that it was carrying something
	whoever it was, he was short, and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face
	and  several paces nearer, the gap between them closing all the time  harry saw that the thing in the persons arms looked like a baby
	or was it merely a bundle of robesharry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at cedric
	cedric shot him a quizzical look
	they both turned back to watch the approaching figure
	it stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only six feet from them
	harry and cedric and the short figure simply looked at one another
	and then, without warning, harry's scar exploded with pain
	it was agony such as he had never felt in all his life his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his hands over his face his knees buckled he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all his head was about to split open
	from far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold voice say, kill the spare
	a swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched the words to the night avada kedavraa blast of green light blazed through harry's eyelids, and he heard something heavy fall to the ground beside him the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that he retched, and then it diminished terrified of what he was about to see, he opened his stinging eyes
	cedric was lying spreadeagled on the ground beside him
	for a second that contained an eternity, harry stared into cedric's face, at his open gray eyes, blank and expressionless as the windows of a deserted house, at his halfopen mouth, which looked slightly surprised
	and then, before harry's mind had accepted what he was seeing, before he could feel anything but numb disbelief, he felt himself being pulled to his feet
	the short man in the cloak had put down his bundle, lit his wand, and was dragging harry toward the marble headstone
	harry saw the name upon it flickering in the wandlight before he was forced around and slammed against it
	tom riddlethe cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords around harry, tying him from neck to ankles to the headstone
	harry could hear shallow, fast breathing from the depths of the hood he struggled, and the man hit him  hit him with a hand that had a finger missing
	and harry realized who was under the hood
	but wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes, did not reply he was busy checking the tightness of the cords, his fingers trembling uncontrollably, rumbling over the knots
	once sure that harry was bound so tightly to the headstone that he couldn't move an inch, wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into harry's mouth then, without a word, he turned from harry and hurried away
	harry couldn't make a sound, nor could he see where wormtail had gone he couldn't turn his head to see beyond the headstone he could see only what was right in front of him
	cedric's body was lying some twenty feet away
	some way beyond him, glinting in the starlight, lay the triwizard cup
	harry's wand was on the ground at cedric's feet
	the bundle of robes that harry had thought was a baby was close by, at the foot of the grave
	it seemed to be stirring fretfully
	harry watched it, and his scar seared with pain again
	and he suddenly knew that he didn't want to see what was in those robes
	he didn't want that bundle opened
	he could hear noises at his feet
	he looked down and saw a gigantic snake slithering through the grass, circling the headstone where he was tied
	wormtail's fast, wheezy breathing was growing louder again
	it sounded as though he was forcing something heavy across the ground
	then he came back within harry's range of vision, and harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to the foot of the grave
	it was full of what seemed to be water  harry could hear it slopping around  and it was larger than any cauldron harry had ever used a great stone belly large enough for a fullgrown man to sit in
	the thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring more persistently, as though it was trying to free itself
	now wormtail was busying himself at the bottom of the cauldron with a wand
	suddenly there were crackling names beneath it
	the large snake slithered away into the darkness
	the liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast
	the surface began not only to bubble, but to send out fiery sparks, as though it were on fire
	steam was thickening, blurring the outline of wormtail tending the fire
	the movements beneath the robes became more agitated
	and harry heard the high, cold voice again
	hurrythe whole surface of the water was alight with sparks now
	it might have been encrusted with diamonds
	wormtail pulled open the robes on the ground, revealing what was inside them, and harry let out a yell that was strangled in the wad of material blocking his mouth
	it was as though wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed something ugly, slimy, and blind  but worse, a hundred times worse
	the thing wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child, except that harry had never seen anything less like a child
	it was hairless and scalylooking, a dark, raw, reddish black
	its arms and legs were thin and feeble, and its face  no child alive ever had a face like that  flat and snakelike, with gleaming red eyes
	the thing seemed almost helpless it raised its thin arms, put them around wormtail's neck, and wormtail lifted it
	as he did so, his hood fell back, and harry saw the look of revulsion on wormtail's weak, pale face in the firelight as he carried the creature to the rim of the cauldron
	for one moment, harry saw the evil, flat face illuminated in the sparks dancing on the surface of the potion
	and then wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron there was a hiss, and it vanished below the surface harry heard its frail body hit the bottom with a soft thud
	let it drown, harry thought, his scar burning almost past endurance, please
	wormtail was speaking
	his voice shook he seemed frightened beyond his wits
	he raised his wand, closed his eyes, and spoke to the night
	bone of the father, unknowingly given, you wil lrenew your sonthe surface of the grave at harry's feet cracked
	horrified, harry watched as a fine trickle of dust rose into the air at wormtail's command and fell softly into the cauldron
	the diamond surface of the water broke and hissed it sent sparks in all directions and turned a vivid, poisonouslooking blue
	and now wormtail was whimpering
	he pulled a long, thin, shining silver dagger from inside his cloak
	his voice broke into petrified sobs
	flesh  of the servant  wwillingly given  you will  revive  your master
	he stretched his right hand out in front of him  the hand with the missing finger
	he gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it upward
	harry realized what wormtail was about to do a second before it happened  he closed his eyes as tightly as he could, but he could not block the scream that pierced the night, that went through harry as though he had been stabbed with the dagger too
	he heard something fall to the ground, heard wormtail's anguished panting, then a sickening splash, as something was dropped into the cauldron
	harry couldn't stand to look
	but the potion had turned a burning red the light of it shone through harry's closed eyelids
	wormtail was gasping and moaning with agony
	not until harry felt wormtail's anguished breath on his face did he realize that wormtail was right in front of him
	harry could do nothing to prevent it, he was tied too tightly
	squinting down, struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding him, he saw the shining silver dagger shaking in wormtails remaining hand
	he felt its point penetrate the crook of his right arm and blood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes
	wormtail, still panting with pain, rumbled in his pocket for a glass vial and held it to harry's cut, so that a dribble of blood fell into it
	he staggered back to the cauldron with harrys blood
	he poured it inside
	the liquid within turned, instantly, a blinding white
	wormtail, his job done, dropped to his knees beside the cauldron, then slumped sideways and lay on the ground, cradling the bleeding stump of his arm, gasping and sobbing
	the cauldron was simmering, sending its diamond sparks in all directions, so blindingly bright that it turned all else to velvety blackness
	harry thought, let it have gone wrong
	and then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the cauldron were extinguished
	a surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead, obliterating everything in front of harry, so that he couldn't see wormtail or cedric or anything but vapor hanging in the air
	it's gone wrong, he thought
	please let it be dead
	but then, through the mist in front of him, he saw, with an icy surge of terror, the dark outline of a man, tall and skeletally thin, rising slowly from inside the cauldron
	robe me, said the high, cold voice from behind the steam, and wormtail, sobbing and moaning, still cradling his mutilated arm, scrambled to pick up the black robes from the ground, got to his feet, reached up, and pulled them onehanded over his master's head
	the thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at harry
	and harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years
	whiter than a skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was flat as a snakes with slits for nostrils
	lord voldemort had risen again
	chapter thirtythree  the death eatersvoldemort looked away from harry and began examining his own body
	his hands were like large, pale spiders his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cats, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness
	he held up his hands and flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant
	he took not the slightest notice of wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling harry again, hissing
	voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally longfingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand
	he caressed it gently too and then he raised it, and pointed it at wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where harry was tied he fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying
	voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh
	wormtail's robes were shining with blood now he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them
	hold out your arm, said voldemort lazily
	he extended the bleeding stump, but voldemort laughed again
	the other arm, wormtail
	voldemort bent down and pulled out wormtail's left arm he forced the sleeve of wormtail's robes up past his elbow, and harry saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo  a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth  the image that had appeared in the sky at the quidditch world cup the dark mark
	voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring wormtail's uncontrollable weeping
	it is back, he said softly, they will all have noticed it
	and now, we shall see
	he pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on wormtail's arm
	the scar on harry s forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and wormtail let out a fresh howl voldemort removed his fingers from wormtail's mark, and harry saw that it had turned jet black
	a look of cruel satisfaction on his face, voldemort straightened up, threw back his head, and stared around at the dark graveyard
	how many will be brave enough to return when they feel it  he whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars
	and how many will be foolish enough to stay awayhe began to pace up and down before harry and wormtail, eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while
	after a minute or so, he looked down at harry again, a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face
	you stand, harry potter, upon the remains of my late father, he hissed softly
	a muggle and a fool
	very like your dear mother
	but they both had their uses, did they not your mother died to defend you as a child
	and i killed my father, and see how useful he has proved himself, in death
	voldemort laughed again
	up and down he paced, looking all around him as he walked, and the snake continued to circle in the grass
	you see that house upon the hillside, potter  my father lived there
	my mother, a witch who lived here in this village, fell in love with him
	but he abandoned her when she told him what she was
	he didn't like magic, my father
	he left her and returned to his muggle parents before i was even born
	potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a muggle orphanage
	but i vowed to find him
	i revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name
	still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave
	listen to me, reliving family history
	he said quietly, why, i am growing quite sentimental
	but look, harry  my true family returns
	the air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks
	between graves, behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were apparating
	all of them were hooded and masked
	and one by one they moved forward
	slowly, cautiously, as though they couldhardly believe their eyes voldemort stood in silence, waiting for them
	then one of the death eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward voldemort and kissed the hem of his black robes
	master    he murmured
	the death eaters behind him did the same each of them approaching voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed tom riddle s grave, harry, voldemort, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was wormtail
	yet they left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people
	voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more
	he looked around at the hooded faces, and though there was no wind rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered
	welcome, death eaters, said voldemort quietly
	thirteen years since last we met
	yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday, we are still united under the dark mark, then  or are wehe put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slitlike nostrils widening
	i smell guilt, he said
	there is a stench or guilt upon the air
	a second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of it longed, but did not dare to step back from him
	i see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact  such prompt appearances and i ask myself
	why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyaltyno one spoke
	no one moved except wormtail, who was upon the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding arm
	and i answer myself, whispered voldemort, they must have believed me broken, they thought i was gone
	they slipped back among my enemies, and they pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment
	and then i ask myself, but how could they have believed i would not rise again  they, who knew the steps i took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death  they, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when i was mightier than any wizard livingand i answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one that could vanquish even lord voldemort
	perhaps they now pay allegiance to another
	perhaps that champion of commoners, of mudbloods and muggles, albus dumbledoreat the mention of dumbledore's name, the members of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook their heads
	voldemort ignored them
	it is a disappointment to me
	i confess myself disappointed
	one of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle
	trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at voldemort's feet
	master he shrieked, master, forgive me  forgive us allvoldemort began to laugh
	cruciothe death eater on the ground writhed and shrieked harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around
	let the police come, he thought desperately
	voldemort raised his wand
	the tortured death eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping
	get up, avery, said voldemort softly
	you ask for forgiveness  i do not forgive
	thirteen long years
	i want thirteen years' repayment before i forgive you
	wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, have you not, wormtailhe looked down at wormtail, who continued to sob
	you returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends
	you deserve this pain, wormtail
	you know that, don't youyes, master, moaned wormtail, please
	yet you helped return me to my body, said voldemort coolly, watching wormtail sob on the ground
	worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me
	and lord voldemort rewards his helpers
	voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air
	a streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand's wake
	momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon wormtails bleeding wrist
	wormtail's sobbing stopped abruptly
	his breathing harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove
	he flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder
	my lord, he whispered
	he scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of voldemort's robes
	may your loyalty never waver again, wormtail, said voldemort
	wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears
	voldemort now approached the man on wormtail's right
	lucius, my slippery friend, he whispered, halting before him
	i am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face
	you are still ready to take the lead in a spot of muggletorture, i believe  yet you never tried to find me, lucius
	your exploits at the quidditch world cup were fun, i daresay
	but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your mastermy lord, i was constantly on the alert, came lucius malfoy's voice swiftly from beneath the hood
	had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, i would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me and yet you ran from my mark, when a faithful death eater sent it into the sky last summer  said voldemort lazily, and mr
	malfoy stopped talking abruptly
	yes, i know all about that, lucius
	you have disappointed me
	i expect more faithful service in the future
	of course, my lord, of course
	you are merciful, thank you
	voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space  large enough for two people  that separated malfoy and the next man
	the lestranges should stand here, said voldemort quietly
	but they are entombed in azkaban
	they went to azkaban rather than renounce me
	when azkaban is broken open, the lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams
	the dementors will join us
	they are our natural allies
	we will recall the banished giants
	i shall have all my devoted servants returned to me, and an army of creatures whom all fear
	some of the death eaters he passed in silence, but he paused before others and spoke to them
	destroying dangerous beasts for the ministry of magic now, wormtail tells me  you shall have better victims than that soon, macnair
	lord voldemort will provide
	thank you, murmured macnair
	and here  voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures  we have crabbe
	you will do better this time, will you not, crabbe  and you, goylethey bowed clumsily, muttering dully
	the same goes for you, nott, said voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in mr
	my lord, i prostrate myself before you, i am your most faithful that will do, said voldemort
	he had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there
	and here we have six missing death eaters
	three dead in my service
	one, too cowardly to return
	one, who i believe has left me forever
	he will be killed, of course
	and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service
	the death eaters stirred, and harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks
	he is at hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight
	yes, said voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in harry's direction
	harry potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party
	one might go so far as to call him my guest of honor
	then the death eater to the right of wormtail stepped forward, and lucius malfoy's voice spoke from under the mask
	master, we crave to know
	we beg you to tell us
	how you have achieved this
	how you managed to return to us
	ah, what a story it is, lucius, said voldemort
	and it begins  and ends  with my young friend here
	he walked lazily over to stand next to harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them
	the snake continued to circle
	you know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall  voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony
	you all know that on the night i lost my powers and my body, i tried to kill him
	his mother died in the attempt to save him  and unwittingly provided him with a protection i admit i had not foreseen
	i could not touch the boy
	voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to harry's cheek
	his mother left upon him the traces other sacrifice
	this is old magic, i should have remembered it, i was foolish to overlook it
	harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his head would burst with the pain
	voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the finger away and continued addressing the death eaters
	i miscalculated, my friends, i admit it
	my curse was deflected by the woman's foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself
	pain beyond pain, my friends nothing could have prepared me for it
	i was ripped from my body, i was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost
	but still, i was alive
	what i was, even i do not know
	i, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality
	you know my goal  to conquer death
	and now, i was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked
	for i had not been killed, though the curse should have done it
	nevertheless, i was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means to help myself
	for i had no body, and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand
	i remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to exist
	i settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and i waited
	surely, one of my faithful death eaters would try and find me
	one of them would come and perform the magic i could not, to restore me to a body
	, but i waited in vain
	the shiver ran once more around the circle of listening death eaters
	voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing
	only one power remained to me
	i could possess the bodies of others
	but i dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for i knew that the aurors were still abroad and searching for me
	i sometimes inhabited animals  snakes, of course, being my preference  but i was little better off inside them than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magic
	and my possession of them shortened their lives none of them lasted long
	the means for my return seemed assured
	a wizard  young, foolish, and gullible  wandered across my path in the forest i had made my home
	oh, he seemed the very chance i had been dreaming of
	for he was a teacher at dumbledore's school
	he was easy to bend to my will
	he brought me back to this country, and after a while, i took possession of his body, to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders
	i did not manage to steal the sorcerer's stone
	i was not to be assured immortal life
	thwarted, once again, by harry potter
	silence once more nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree
	the death eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon voldemort, and upon harry
	the servant died when i left his body, and i was left as weak as ever i had been, voldemort continued
	i returned to my hiding place far away, and i will not pretend to you that i didn't then fear that i might never regain my powers
	yes, that was perhaps my darkest hour
	i could not hope that i would be sent another wizard to possess
	and i had given up hope, now, that any of my death eaters cared what had become of me
	one or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but voldemort took no notice
	and then, not even a year ago, when i had almost abandoned hope, it happened at last
	a servant returned to me
	wormtail here, who had faked his own death to escape justice, was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends, and decided to return to his master
	he sought me in the country where it had long been rumored i was hiding
	helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way
	wormtail has a curious affinity with rats, do you not, wormtail  his filthy little friends told him there was a place, deep in an albanian forest, that they avoided, where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them
	but his journey back to me was not smooth, was it, wormtail  for, hungry one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food
	and who should he meet there, but one bertha jorkins, a witch from the ministry of magic
	now see the way that fate favors lord voldemort
	this might have been the end of wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration
	but wormtail  displaying a presence of mind i would never have expected from him  convinced bertha jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll
	he overpowered her
	he brought her to me
	and bertha jorkins, who might have ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams
	for  with a little persuasion  she became a veritable mine of information
	she told me that the triwizard tournament would be played at hogwarts this year
	she told me that she knew of a faithful death eater who would be only too willing to help me, if i could only contact him
	she told me many things
	but the means i used to break the memory charm upon her were powerful, and when i had extracted all useful information from her, her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair
	she had now served her purpose
	i could not possess her
	voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and pitiless
	wormtail's body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed him dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed
	however, he was the ablebodied servant i needed, and, poor wizard though he is, wormtail was able to follow the instructions i gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body i would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth
	a spell or two of my own invention
	a little help from my dear nagini,  voldemorts red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake, a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom nagini provided
	i was soon returned to an almost human form, and strong enough to travel
	there was no hope of stealing the sorcerer's stone anymore, for i knew that dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed
	but i was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality
	i set my sights lower
	i would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength
	i knew that to achieve this  it is an old piece of dark magic, the potion that revived me tonight  i would need three powerful ingredients
	well, one of them was already at hand, was it not, wormtail  flesh given by a servant
	my father's bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come here, where he was buried
	but the blood of a foe
	wormtail would have had me use any wizard, would you not, wormtail  any wizard who had hated me
	as so many of them still do
	but i knew the one i must use, if i was to rise again, more powerful than i had been when i had fallen
	i wanted harry potters blood
	i wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago
	for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too
	but how to get at harry potter  for he has been better protected than i think even he knows, protected in ways devised by dumbledore long ago, when it fell to him to arrange the boy's future
	dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the boy's protection as long as he is in his relations' care
	not even i can touch him there
	then, of course, there was the quidditch world cup
	i thought his protection might be weaker there, away from his relations and dumbledore, but i was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of ministry wizards
	and then, the boy would return to hogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that muggleloving fool from morning until night
	so how could i take himwhy
	by using bertha jorkins's information, of course
	use my one faithful death eater, stationed at hogwarts, to ensure that the boy's name was entered into the goblet of fire
	use my death eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament  that he touched the triwizard cup first  the cup which my death eater had turned into a portkey, which would bring him here, beyond the reach of dumbledore's help and protection, and into my waiting arms
	the boy you all believed had been my downfall
	voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face harry
	crucioit was pain beyond anything harry had ever experienced his very bones were on fire his head was surely splitting along his scar his eyes were rolling madly in his head he wanted it to end
	he was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of voldemort's father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist
	the night was ringing with the sound of the death eaters' laughter
	you see, i think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me, said voldemort
	but i want there to be no mistake in anybody's mind
	harry potter escaped me by a lucky chance
	and i am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is no dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him
	i will give him his chance
	he will be allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger
	just a little longer, nagini, he whispered, and the snake glided away through the grass to where the death eaters stood watching
	now untie him, wormtail, and give him back his wand
	chapter thirtyfour  priori incantatemwormtail approached harry, who scrambled to find his feet, to support his own weight before the ropes were untied
	wormtail raised his new silver hand, pulled out the wad of material gagging harry, and then, with one swipe, cut through the bonds tying harry to the gravestone
	there was a split second, perhaps, when harry might have considered running for it, but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave, as the death eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter circle around him and voldemort, so that the gaps where the missing death eaters should have stood were filled
	wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where cedric's body lay and returned with harry's wand, which he thrust roughly into harry's hand without looking at him
	then wormtail resumed his place in the circle of watching death eaters
	you have been taught how to duel
	harry potter  said voldemort softly, his red eyes glinting through the darkness
	at these words harry remembered, as though from a former life, the dueling club at hogwarts he had attended briefly two years ago
	all he had learned there was the disarming spell, expelliarmus
	and what use would it be to deprive voldemort of his wand, even if he could, when he was surrounded by death eaters, outnumbered by at least thirty to one  he had never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this
	he knew he was facing the thing against which moody had always warned
	the unblockable avada kedavra curse  and voldemort was right  his mother was not here to die for him this time
	he was quite unprotected
	harry, said voldemort, bending a little, but keeping his snakelike face upturned to harry
	come, the niceties must be observed
	dumbledore would like you to show manners
	the death eaters were laughing again
	voldemorts lipless mouth was smiling
	he was not going to let voldemort play with him before killing him
	he was not going to give him that satisfaction
	i said, bow, voldemort said, raising his wand  and harry felt his spine curve as though a huge, invisible hand were bending him ruthlessly forward, and the death eaters laughed harder than ever
	very good, said voldemort softly, and as he raised his wand the pressure bearing down upon harry lifted too
	and now you face me, like a man
	straightbacked and proud, the way your father died
	voldemort raised his wand, and before harry could do anything to defend himself, before he could even move, he had been hit again by the cruciatus curse
	the pain was so intense, so allconsuming, that he no longer knew where he was
	whitehot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely going to burst with pain, he was screaming more loudly than he'd ever screamed in his life and then it stopped
	harry rolled over and scrambled to his feet he was shaking as uncontrollably as wormtail had done when his hand had been cut off he staggered sideways into the wall of watching death eaters, and they pushed him away, back toward voldemort
	a little break, said voldemort, the slitlike nostrils dilating with excitement, a little pause
	that hurt, didn't it
	harry  you don't want me to do that again, do youharry didn't answer
	he was going to die like cedric, those pitiless red eyes were telling him so
	he was going to die, and there was nothing he could do about it
	but he wasn't going to play along
	he wasn't going to obey voldemort
	he wasn't going to beg
	i asked you whether you want me to do that again, said voldemort softly
	answer me  imperialand harry felt, for the third time in his life, the sensation that his mind had been wiped of all thought
	ah, it was bliss, not to think, it was as though he were floating, dreaming
	i will not, said a stronger voice, in the back of his head, i won't answer
	i won't do it, i won't say it
	i won'tand these words burst from harry's mouth they echoed through the graveyard, and the dream state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been thrown over him  back rushed the aches that the cruciatus curse had left all over his body  back rushed the realization of where he was, and what he was facing
	you won't said voldemort quietly, and the death eaters were not laughing now
	you won't say no  harry, obedience is a virtue i need to teach you before you die
	perhaps another little dose of painvoldemort raised his wand, but this time harry was ready with the reflexes born of his quidditch training, he flung himself sideways onto the ground he rolled behind the marble headstone of voldemort s father, and he heard it crack as the curse missed him
	we are not playing hideandseek, harry, said voldemort's soft, cold voice, drawing nearer, as the death eaters laughed
	you cannot hide from me
	does this mean you are tired of our duel  does this mean that you would prefer me to finish it now, harry  come out, harry
	come out and play, then
	it might even be painless
	harry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had come
	and as he heard voldemort draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason  he was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hideandseek he was not going to die kneeling at voldemort s feet
	he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defense was possible
	before voldemort could stick his snakelike face around the headstone
	he gripped his wand tightly in his hand, thrust it out in front of him, and threw himself around the headstone, facing voldemort
	as harry shouted, expelliarmus voldemort cried, avada kedavraa jet of green light issued from voldemorts wand just as a jet of red light blasted from harry's  they met in midair  and suddenly harry's wand was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it his hand seized up around it he couldn't have released it if he'd wanted to  and a narrow beam of light connected the two wands, neither red nor green, but bright, deep gold
	harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw that voldemort's long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating
	and then  nothing could have prepared harry for this  he felt his feet lift from the ground
	he and voldemort were both being raised into the air, their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light
	they glided away from the tombstone of voldemort's father and then came to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and free of graves
	the death eaters were shouting they were asking voldemort for instructions they were closing in, reforming the circle around harry and voldemort, the snake slithering at their heels, some of them drawing their wands the golden thread connecting harry and voldemort splintered though the wands remained connected, a thousand more beams arced high over harry and voldemort, crisscrossing all around them, until they were enclosed in a golden, domeshaped web, acage of light, beyond which the death eaters circled like jackals, their cries strangely muffled now
	do nothing  voldemort shrieked to the death eaters, and harry saw his red eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening, saw him fighting to break the thread of light still connecting his wand with harry's harry held onto his wand more tightly, with both hands, and the golden thread remained unbroken
	do nothing unless i command you  voldemort shouted to the death eaters
	and then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the air
	it was coming from every thread of the lightspun web vibrating around harry and voldemort
	it was a sound harry recognized, though he had heard it only once before in his life  phoenix song
	it was the sound of hope to harry
	the most beautiful and welcome thing he had ever heard in his life
	he felt as though the song were inside him instead of just around him
	it was the sound he connected with dumbledore, and it was almost as though a friend were speaking in his ear
	don't break the connection
	harry told the music, i know i mustn't
	but no sooner had he thought it, than the thing became much harder to do
	his wand began to vibrate more powerfully than ever
	and now the beam between him and voldemort changed too
	it was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands  harry felt his wand give a shudder under his hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his way
	the direction of the beams movement was now toward him, from voldemort, and he felt his wand shudder angrily
	as the closest bead of light moved nearer to harrys wand tip, the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame
	the closer that bead moved, the harder harry's wand vibrated he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers he concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back toward voldemort, his ears full of phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixed
	and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly, they began to move the other way
	and it was voldemort's wand that was vibrating extrahard now
	voldemort who looked astonished, and almost fearful
	one of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of voldemorts wand
	harry didn't understand why he was doing it, didn't know what it might achieve
	but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on forcing that bead of light right back into voldemort s wand
	it moved along the golden thread
	it trembled for a moment
	and then it connected
	at once, voldemorts wand began to emit echoing screams of pain
	then  voldemort's red eyes widened with shock  a dense, smoky hand flew out of the tip of it and vanished
	the ghost of the hand he had made wormtail
	more shouts of pain
	and then something much larger began to blossom from voldemorts wand tip, a great, grayish something, that looked as though it were made of the solidest, densest smoke
	now a chest and arms
	the torso of cedric diggory
	if ever harry might have released his wand from shock, it would have been then, but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly, so that the thread of golden light remained unbroken, even though the thick gray ghost of cedric diggory was it a ghost it looked sosolid emerged in its entirety from the end of voldemort s wand, as though it were squeezing itself out of a very narrow tunnel
	and this shade of cedric stood up, and looked up and down the golden thread of light, and spoke
	its voice was distant and echoing
	harry looked at voldemort
	his wide red eyes were still shocked
	he had no more expected this than harry had
	harry heard the frightened yells of the death eaters, prowling around the edges of the golden dome
	more screams of pain from the wand
	and then something else emerged from its tip
	the dense shadow of a second head, quickly followed by arms and torso
	an old man harry had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the wand just as cedric had done
	and his ghost, or his shadow, or whatever it was, fell next to cedric's, and surveyed harry and voldemort, and the golden web, and the connected wands, with mild surprise, leaning on his walking stick
	he was a real wizard, then  the old man said, his eyes on voldemort
	killed me, that one did
	but already, yet another head was emerging
	and this head, gray as a smoky statue, was a woman's
	harry, both arms shaking now as he fought to keep his wand still, saw her drop to the ground and straighten up like the others, staring
	the shadow of bertha jorkins surveyed the battle before her with wide eyes
	don't let go, now  she cried, and her voice echoed like cedrics as though from very far away
	don't let him get you, harry  don't let goshe and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of the golden web, while the death eaters flitted around the outside of it
	and voldemort's dead victims whispered as they circled the duelers, whispered words of encouragement to harry, and hissed words harry couldn't hear to voldemort
	and now another head was emerging from the tip of voldemorts wand
	and harry knew when he saw it who it would be
	he knew, as though he had expected it from the moment when cedric had appeared from the wand
	knew, because the man appearing was the one he'd thought of more than any other tonight
	the smoky shadow of a tall man with untidy hair fell to the ground as bertha had done, straightened up, and looked at him
	and harry, his arms shaking madly now, looked back into the ghostly face of his father
	your mother's coming
	she wants to see you
	it will be all right
	first her head, then her body
	a young woman with long hair, the smoky, shadowy form of lily potter blossomed from the end of voldemort's wand, fell to the ground, and straightened like her husband
	she walked close to harry, looking down at him, and she spoke in the same distant, echoing voice as the others, but quietly, so that voldemort, his face now livid with fear as his victims prowled around him, could not hear
	when the connection is broken, we will linger for only moments
	but we will give you time
	you must get to the portkey, it will return you to hogwarts
	do you understand, harryyes, harry gasped, fighting now to keep a hold on his wand, which was slipping and sliding beneath his fingers
	whispered the figure of cedric, take my body back, will you  take my body back to my parents,
	i will, said harry, his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wand
	do it now, whispered his father's voice, be ready to run
	now  harry yelled he didn't think he could have held on for another moment anyway  he pulled his wand upward with an almighty wrench, and the golden thread broke the cage of light vanished, the phoenix song died  but the shadowy figures of voldemort's victims did not disappear  they were closing in upon voldemort, shielding harry from his gaze and harry ran as he had never run in his life, knocking two stunned death eaters aside as he passed he zigzagged behind headstones, feeling their curses following him, hearing them hit the headstones  he was dodging curses and graves, pelting toward cedric's body, no longer aware of the pain in his leg, his whole being concentrated on what he had to do stun him he heard voldemort scream
	ten feet from cedric, harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it
	gripping his wand more tightly, he dashed out from behind the angel impedimenta he bellowed, pointing his wand wildly over his shoulder at the death eaters running at him
	from a muffled yell, he thought he had stopped at least one of them, but there was no time to stop and look he jumped over the cup and dived as he heard more wand blasts behind him more jets of light flew over his head as he fell, stretching out his hand to grab cedric's arm
	stand aside  i will kill him  he is mine shrieked voldemort
	harry's hand had closed on cedric's wrist one tombstone stood between him and voldemort, but cedric was too heavy to carry, and the cup was out of reach voldemort's red eyes flamed in the darkness
	harry saw his mouth curl into a smile, saw him raise his wand
	accio  harry yelled, pointing his wand at the triwizard cup
	it flew into the air and soared toward him
	harry caught it by the handle he heard voldemort s scream of fury at the same moment that he felt the jerk behind his navel that meant the portkey had worked  it was speeding him away in a whirl of wind and color, and cedric along with him
	they were going back
	chapter thirtyfive  veritaserumharry felt himself slam flat into the ground his face was pressed into grass the smell of it filled his nostrils
	he had closed his eyes while the portkey transported him, and he kept them closed now
	all the breath seemed to have been knocked out of him his head was swimming so badly he felt as though the ground beneath him were swaying like the deck of a ship
	to hold himself steady, he tightened his hold on the two things he was still clutching the smooth, cold handle of the triwizard cup and cedric's body
	he felt as though he would slide away into the blackness gathering at the edges of his brain if he let go of either of them
	shock and exhaustion kept him on the ground, breathing in the smell of the grass, waiting
	waiting for someone to do something
	something to happen
	and all the while, his scar burned dully on his forehead
	a torrent of sound deafened and confused him there were voices everywhere, footsteps, screams
	he remained where he was, his face screwed up against the noise, as though it were a nightmare that would pass
	then a pair of hands seized him roughly and turned him over
	harry  harryhe opened his eyes
	he was looking up at the starry sky, and albus dumbledore was crouched over him
	the dark shadows of a crowd of people pressed in around them, pushing nearer harry felt the ground beneath his head reverberating with their footsteps
	he had come back to the edge of the maze
	he could see the stands rising above him, the shapes of people moving in them, the stars above
	harry let go of the cup, but he clutched cedric to him even more tightly
	he raised his free hand and seized dumbledore's wrist, while dumbledore's face swam in and out of focus
	he's back, harry whispered
	what's going on  what's happenedthe face of cornelius fudge appeared upside down over harry it looked white, appalled
	my god  diggory  it whispered
	dumbledore  he's deadthe words were repeated, the shadowy figures pressing in on them gasped it to those around them
	and then others shouted it  screeched it  into the night  he's dead  he's dead  cedric diggory  deadharry, let go of him, he heard fudge's voice say, and he felt fingers trying to pry him from cedric's limp body, but harry wouldn't let him go
	then dumbledore's face, which was still blurred and misted, came closer
	harry, you can't help him now
	he wanted me to bring him back, harry muttered  it seemed important to explain this
	he wanted me to bring him back to his parents
	dumbledore bent down, and with extraordinary strength for a man so old and thin, raised harry from the ground and set him on his feet
	his head was pounding
	his injured leg would no longer support his weight
	the crowd around them jostled, fighting to get closer, pressing darkly in on him  what's happened  what's wrong with him diggorys deadhe'll need to go to the hospital wing  fudge was saying loudly
	he's ill, he's injured  dumbledore, diggory's parents, they're here, they're in the stands
	i'll take harry, dumbledore, i'll take him no, i would preferdumbledore, amos diggorys running
	don't you think you should tell him  before he sees  harry, stay here girls were screaming, sobbing hysterically
	the scene flickered oddly before harry's eyes
	its all right, son, i've got you
	dumbledore said stay, said harry thickly, the pounding in his scar making him feel as though he was about to throw up his vision was blurring worse than ever
	someone larger and stronger than he was was half pulling, half carrying him through the frightened crowd
	harry heard people gasping, screaming, and shouting as the man supporting him pushed a path through them, taking him back to the castle
	across the lawn, past the lake and the durmstrang ship, harry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walk
	harry  the man asked at last as he lifted harry up the stone steps
	it was madeye moody
	cup was a portkey, said harry as they crossed the entrance hall
	took me and cedric to a graveyard
	and voldemort was there
	up the marble stairs
	the dark lord was there  what happened thenkilled cedric
	along the corridor
	the dark lord got his body back  he's returnedand the death eaters came
	you dueled with the dark lordgot away
	i saw my mum and dad
	they came out of his wand
	in here, and sit down
	you'll be all right now
	harry heard a key scrape in a lock and felt a cup being pushed into his hands
	harry, i need to know exactly what happened
	moody helped tip the stuff down harrys throat he coughed, a peppery taste burning his throat
	moody's office came into sharper focus, and so did moody himself
	he looked as white as fudge had looked, and both eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon harry's face
	voldemort's back, harry  you're sure he's back  how did he do ithe took stuff from his father's grave, and from wormtail, and me, said harry
	his head felt clearer his scar wasn't hurting so badly he could now see moodys face distinctly, even though the office was dark
	he could still hear screaming and shouting from the distant quidditch field
	what did the dark lord take from you said moody
	blood, said harry, raising his arm
	his sleeve was ripped where wormtail's dagger had torn it
	moody let out his breath in a long, low hiss
	and the death eaters  they returnedyes, said harry
	how did he treat them  moody asked quietly
	did he forgive thembut harry had suddenly remembered
	he should have told dumbledore, he should have said it straightaway there's a death eater at hogwarts  there's a death eater here  they put my name in the goblet of fire, they made sure i got through to the end harry tried to get up, but moody pushed him back down
	i know who the death eater is, he said quietly
	karkaroff  said harry wildly
	where is he  have you got him  is he locked upkarkaroff said moody with an odd laugh
	karkaroff fled tonight, when he felt the dark mark burn upon his arm
	he betrayed too many faithful supporters of the dark lord to wish to meet them
	but i doubt he will get far
	the dark lord has ways of tracking his enemies
	karkaroff's gone  he ran away  but then  he didn't put my name in the gobletno, said moody slowly
	it was i who did that
	harry heard, but didn't believe
	no, you didn't, he said
	i assure you i did, said moody, and his magical eye swung around and fixed upon the door, and harry knew he was making sure that there was no one outside it
	at the same time, moody drew out his wand and pointed it at harry
	he forgave them, then  he said
	the death eaters who went free  the ones who escaped azkabanwhat  said harry
	he was looking at the wand moody was pointing at him
	this was a bad joke, it had to be
	i asked you, said moody quietly, whether he forgave the scum who never even went to look for him
	those treacherous cowards who wouldn't even brave azkaban for him
	the faithless, worthless bits of filth who were brave enough to cavort in masks at the quidditch world cup, but fled at the sight of the dark mark when i fired it into the sky
	what are you talking about
	if there's one thing i hate more than any other, it's a death eater who walked free
	they turned their backs on my master when he needed them most
	i expected him to punish them
	i expected him to torture them
	tell me hehurt them, harry
	moody's face was suddenly lit with an insane smile
	tell me he told them that i, i alone remained faithful
	prepared to risk everything to deliver to him the one thing he wanted above all
	who put your name in the goblet of fire, under the name of a different school  i did
	who frightened off every person i thought might try to hurt you or prevent you from winning the tournament  i did
	who nudged hagrid into showing you the dragons  i did
	who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon  i didmoody's magical eye had now left the door
	it was fixed upon harry
	his lopsided mouth leered more widely than ever
	it hasn't been easy, harry, guiding you through these tasks without arousing suspicion
	i have had to use every ounce of cunning i possess, so that my hand would not be detectable in your success
	dumbledore would have been very suspicious if you had managed everything too easily
	as long as you got into that maze, preferably with a decent head start  then, i knew, i would have a chance of getting rid of the other champions and leaving your way clear
	but i also had to contend with your stupidity
	that was when i was most afraid we would fail
	i was keeping watch on you, potter
	i knew you hadn't worked out the egg's clue, so i had to give you another hint you didn't, harry said hoarsely
	cedric gave me the clue who told cedric to open it underwater  i did
	i trusted that he would pass the information on to you
	decent people are so easy to manipulate, potter
	i was sure cedric would want to repay you for telling him about the dragons, and so he did
	but even then,potter, even then you seemed likely to fail
	i was watching all the time
	all those hours in the library
	didn't you realize that the book you needed was in your dormitory all along  i planted it there early on, i gave it to the longbottom boy, don't you remember  magical water plants of the mediterranean
	it would have told you all you needed to know about gillyweed
	i expected you to ask everyone and anyone you could for help
	longbottom would have told you in an instant
	you have a streak of pride and independence that might have ruined all
	so what could i do  feed you information from another innocent source
	you told me at the yule ball a houseelf called dobby had given you a christmas present
	i called the elf to the staffroom to collect some robes for cleaning
	i staged a loud conversation with professor mcgonagall about the hostages who had been taken, and whether potter would think to use gillyweed
	and your little elf friend ran straight to snape's office and then hurried to find you
	moodys wand was still pointing directly at harry's heart
	over his shoulder, foggy shapes were moving in the foeglass on the wall
	you were so long in that lake, potter, i thought you had drowned
	but luckily, dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility, and marked you high for it
	you had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight, of course, said moody
	i was patrolling around it, able to see through the outer hedges, able to curse many obstacles out of your way
	i stunned fleur delacour as she passed
	i put the imperius curse on krum, so that he would finish diggory and leave your path to the cup clear
	harry stared at moody
	he just didn't see how this could be
	dumbledore's friend, the famous auror
	the one who had caught so many death eaters
	the foggy shapes in the foeglass were sharpening, had become more distinct
	harry could see the outlines of three people over moody's shoulder, moving closer and closer
	but moody wasn't watching them
	his magical eye was upon harry
	the dark lord didn't manage to kill you
	potter, and he so wanted to, whispered moody
	imagine how he will reward me when he finds i have done it for him
	i gave you to him  the thing he needed above all to regenerate  and then i killed you for him
	i will be honored beyond all other death eaters
	i will be his dearest, his closest supporter
	moody's normal eye was bulging, the magical eye fixed upon harry
	the door was barred, and harry knew he would never reach his own wand in time
	the dark lord and i, said moody, and he looked completely insane now, towering over harry, leering down at him, have much in common
	both of us, for instance, had very disappointing fathers
	very disappointing indeed
	both of us suffered the indignity, harry, of being named after those fathers
	and both of us had the pleasure
	the very great pleasure
	of killing our fathers to ensure the continued rise of the dark orderyou're mad, harry said  he couldn't stop himself you're madmad, am i said moody, his voice rising uncontrollably
	we'll see  we'll see who's mad, now that the dark lord has returned, with me at his side  he is back, harry potter, you did not conquer him  and now  i conquer youmoody raised his wand, he opened his mouth harry plunged his own hand into his robes stupefy  there was a blinding flash of red light, and with a great splintering and crashing, the door of moody's office was blasted apart moody was thrown backward onto the office floor
	harry, still staring at the place where moody's face had been, saw albus dumbledore, professor snape, and professor mcgonagall looking back at him out of the foeglass
	he looked around and saw the three of them standing in the doorway, dumbledore in front, his wand outstretched
	at that moment, harry fully understood for the first time why people said dumbledore was the only wizard voldemort had ever feared
	the look upon dumbledore's face as he stared down at the unconscious form of madeye moody was more terrible than harry could have ever imagined
	there was no benign smile upon dumbledore's face, no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles
	there was cold fury in every line of the ancient face a sense of power radiated from dumbledore as though he were giving off burning heat
	he stepped into the office, placed a foot underneath moodys unconscious body, and kicked him over onto his back, so that his face was visible
	snape followed him, looking into the foeglass, where his own face was still visible, glaring into the room
	professor mcgonagall went straight to harry
	come along, potter, she whispered
	the thin line of her mouth was twitching as though she was about to cry
	no, said dumbledore sharply
	dumbledore, he ought to  look at him  he's been through enough tonight he will stay, minerva, because he needs to understand, said dumbledore curtly
	understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery
	he needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered tonight, and why,moody, harry said
	he was still in a state of complete disbelief
	how can it have been moodythis is not alastor moody, said dumbledore quietly
	you have never known alastor moody
	the real moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight
	the moment he took you, i knew  and i followed
	dumbledore bent down over moody's limp form and put a hand inside his robes
	he pulled out moody's hip flask and a set of keys on a ring
	then he turned to professors mcgonagall and snape
	severus, please fetch me the strongest truth potion you possess, and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the houseelf called winky
	minerva, kindly go down to hagrid's house, where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch
	take the dog up to my office, tell him i will be with him shortly, then come back here
	if either snape or mcgonagall found these instructions peculiar, they hid their confusion
	both turned at once and left the office
	dumbledore walked over to the trunk with seven locks, fitted the first key in the lock, and opened it
	it contained a mass of spellbooks
	dumbledore closed the trunk, placed a second key in the second lock, and opened the trunk again
	the spellbooks had vanished this time it contained an assortment of broken sneakoscopes, some parchment and quills, and what looked like a silvery invisibility cloak
	harry watched, astounded, as dumbledore placed the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth keys in their respective locks, reopening the trunk each time, and revealing different contents each time
	then he placed the seventh key in the lock, threw open the lid, and harry let out a cry of amazement
	he was looking down into a kind of pit, an underground room, and lying on the floor some ten feet below, apparently fast asleep, thin and starved in appearance, was the real madeye moody
	his wooden leg was gone, the socket that should have held the magical eye looked empty beneath its lid, and chunks of his grizzled hair were missing
	harry stared, thunderstruck, between the sleeping moody in the trunk and the unconscious moody lying on the floor of the office
	dumbledore climbed into the trunk, lowered himself, and fell lightly onto the floor beside the sleeping moody
	stunned  controlled by the imperius curse  very weak, he said
	of course, they would have needed to keep him alive
	harry, throw down the imposter's cloak  he's freezing
	madam pomfrey will need to see him, but he seems in no immediate danger
	harry did as he was told dumbledore covered moody in the cloak, tucked it around him, and clambered out of the trunk again
	then he picked up the hip flask that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and turned it over
	a thick glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor
	polyjuice potion, harry, said dumbledore
	you see the simplicity of it, and the brilliance
	for moody never does drink except from his hip flask, he's well known for it
	the imposter needed, of course, to keep the real moody close by, so that he could continue making the potion
	dumbledore looked down on the moody in the trunk
	the imposter has been cutting it off all year, see where it is uneven  but i think, in the excitement of tonight, our fake moody might have forgotten to take it as frequendy as he should have done
	dumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it, his eyes fixed upon the unconscious moody on the floor
	harry stared at him too
	minutes passed in silence
	then, before harry's very eyes, the face of the man on the floor began to change
	the scars were disappearing, the skin was becoming smooth the mangled nose became whole and started to shrink
	the long mane of grizzled gray hair was withdrawing into the scalp and turning the color of straw
	suddenly, with a loud clunk, the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew in its place next moment, the magical eyeball had popped out of the man's face as a real eye replaced it it rolled away across the floor and continued to swivel in every direction
	harry saw a man lying before him, paleskinned, slightly freckled, with a mop of fair hair
	he had seen him in dumbledore's pensieve, had watched him being led away from court by the dementors, trying to convince mr
	crouch that he was innocent
	but he was lined around the eyes now and looked much older
	there were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor
	snape had returned with winky at his heels
	professor mcgonagall was right behind them
	crouch  snape said, stopping dead in the doorway
	barty crouchgood heavens, said professor mcgonagall, stopping dead and staring down at the man on the floor
	filthy, disheveled, winky peered around snape's legs
	her mouth opened wide and she let out a piercing shriek
	master barty, master barty, what is you doing hereshe flung herself forward onto the young man's chest
	you is killed him  you is killed him  you is killed master's sonhe is simply stunned, winky, said dumbledore
	severus, you have the potionsnape handed dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid the veritaserum with which he had threatened harry in class
	dumbledore got up, bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a sitting position against the wall beneath the foeglass, in which the reflections of dumbledore, snape, and mcgonagall were still glaring down upon them all
	winky remained on her knees, trembling, her hands over her face
	dumbledore forced the mans mouth open and poured three drops inside it
	then he pointed his wand at the mans chest and said, ennervate
	crouch's son opened his eyes
	his face was slack, his gaze unfocused
	dumbledore knelt before him, so that their faces were level
	can you hear me  dumbledore asked quietly
	the man's eyelids flickered
	i would like you to tell us, said dumbledore softly, how you came to be here
	how did you escape from azkabancrouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat, expressionless voice
	she knew she was dying
	she persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favor to her
	he loved her as he had never loved me
	they came to visit me
	they gave me a draft of polyjuice potion containing one of my mother's hairs
	she took a draft of polyjuice potion containing one of my hairs
	we took on each other's appearance
	winky was shaking her head, trembling
	master barty, say no more, you is getting your father into troublebut crouch took another deep breath and continued in the same flat voice
	the dementors are blind
	they sensed one healthy, one dying person entering azkaban
	they sensed one healthy, one dying person leaving it
	my father smuggled me out, disguised as my mother, in case any prisoners were watching through their doors
	my mother died a short while afterward in azkaban
	she was careful to drink polyjuice potion until the end
	she was buried under my name and bearing my appearance
	everyone believed her to be me
	the man's eyelids flickered
	and what did your father do with you, when he had got you home  said dumbledore quietly
	staged my mother's death
	a quiet, private funeral
	that grave is empty
	the houseelf nursed me back to health
	then i had to be concealed
	i had to be controlled
	my father had to use a number of spells to subdue me
	when i had recovered my strength, i thought only of finding my master
	of returning to his service
	how did your father subdue you  said dumbledore
	the imperius curse, moody said
	i was under my fathers control
	i was forced to wear an invisibility cloak day and night
	i was always with the houseelf
	she was my keeper and caretaker
	she persuaded my father to give me occasional treats
	rewards for my good behavior
	master barty, master barty, sobbed winky through her hands
	you isn't ought to tell them, we is getting in trouble
	did anybody ever discover that you were still alive  said dumbledore softly
	did anyone know except your father and the houseelfyes, said crouch, his eyelids flickering again
	a witch in my father's office
	she came to the house with papers for my father s signature
	winky showed her inside and returned to the kitchen, to me
	but bertha jorkins heard winky talking to me
	she came to investigate
	she heard enough to guess who was hiding under the invisibility cloak
	my father arrived home
	he put a very powerful memory charm on her to make her forget what she'd found out
	he said it damaged her memory permanently
	why is she coming to nose into my masters private business  sobbed winky
	why isn't she leaving us betell me about the quidditch world cup, said dumbledore
	winky talked my father into it, said crouch, still in the same monotonous voice
	she spent months persuading him
	i had not left the house for years
	i had loved quidditch
	let him go, she said
	he will be in his invisibility cloak
	let him smell fresh air for once
	she said my mother would have wanted it
	she told my father that my mother had died to give me freedom
	she had not saved me for a life of imprisonment
	he agreed in the end
	it was carefully planned
	my father led me and winky up to the top box early in the day
	winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father
	i was to sit there, invisible
	when everyone had left the box, we would emerge
	winky would appear to be alone
	nobody would ever know
	but winky didn't know that i was growing stronger
	i was starting to fight my father's imperius curse
	there were times when i was almost myself again
	there were brief periods when i seemed outside his control
	it happened, there, in the top box
	it was like waking from a deep sleep
	i found myself out in public, in the middle of the match, and i saw, in front of me, a wand sticking out of a boys pocket
	i had not been allowed a wand since before azkaban
	winky is frightened of heights
	she had her face hidden
	master barty, you bad boy  whispered winky, tears trickling between her fingers
	so you took the wand, said dumbledore, and what did you do with itwe went back to the tent, said crouch
	we heard the death eaters
	the ones who had never been to azkaban
	the ones who had never suffered for my master
	they had turned their backs on him
	they were not enslaved, as i was
	they were free to seek him, but they did not
	they were merely making sport of muggles
	the sound of their voices awoke me
	my mind was clearer than it had been in years
	i wanted to attack them for their disloyalty to my master
	my father had left the tent he had gone to free the muggles
	winky was afraid to see me so angry
	she used her own brand of magic to bind me to her
	she pulled me from the tent, pulled me into the forest, away from the death eaters
	i tried to hold her back
	i wanted to return to the campsite
	i wanted to show those death eaters what loyalty to the dark lord meant, and to punish them for their lack of it
	i used the stolen wand to cast the dark mark into the sky
	ministry wizards arrived
	they shot stunning spells everywhere
	one of the spells came through the trees where winky and i stood
	the bond connecting us was broken
	we were both stunned
	when winky was discovered, my father knew i must be nearby
	he searched the bushes where she had been found and felt me lying there
	he waited until the other ministry members had left the forest
	he put me back under the imperius curse and took me home
	she had let me acquire a wand
	she had almost let me escape
	winky let out a wail of despair
	now it was just father and i, alone in the house
	crouch's head rolled on his neck, and an insane grin spread across his face
	my master came for me
	he arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant wormtail
	my master had found out that i was still alive
	he had captured bertha jorkins in albania
	he had tortured her
	she told him a great deal
	she told him about the triwizard tournament
	she told him the old auror, moody, was going to teach at hogwarts
	he tortured her until he broke through the memory charm my father had placed upon her
	she told him i had escaped from azkaban
	she told him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from seeking my master
	and so my master knew that i was still his faithful servant  perhaps the most faithful of all
	my master conceived a plan, based upon the information bertha had given him
	he arrived at our house near midnight
	my father answered the door
	the smile spread wider over crouch's face, as though recalling the sweetest memory of his life
	winky's petrified brown eyes were visible through her fingers
	she seemed too appalled to speak
	my father was placed under the imperius curse by my master
	now my father was the one imprisoned, controlled
	my master forced him to go about his business as usual, to act as though nothing was wrong
	i was myself again, alive as i hadn't been in years
	and what did lord voldemort ask you to do  said dumbledore
	he asked me whether i was ready to risk everything for him
	it was my dream, my greatest ambition, to serve him, to prove myself to him
	he told me he needed to place a faithful servant at hogwarts
	a servant who would guide harry potter through the triwizard tournament without appearing to do so
	a servant who would watch over harry potter
	ensure he reached the triwizard cup
	turn the cup into a portkey, which would take the first person to touch it to my master
	but first you needed alastor moody, said dumbledore
	his blue eyes were blazing, though his voice remained calm
	wormtail and i did it
	we had prepared the polyjuice potion beforehand
	we journeyed to his house
	moody put up a struggle
	there was a commotion
	we managed to subdue him just in time
	forced him into a compartment of his own magical trunk
	took some of his hair and added it to the potion
	i drank it i became moody's double
	i took his leg and his eye
	i was ready to face arthur weasley when he arrived to sort out the muggles who had heard a disturbance
	i made the dustbins move around the yard
	i told arthur weasley i had heard intruders in my yard, who had set off the dustbins
	then i packed up moody's clothes and dark detectors, put them in the trunk with moody, and set off for hogwarts
	i kept him alive, under the imperius curse
	i wanted to be able to question him
	to find out about his past, learn his habits, so that i could fool even dumbledore
	i also needed his hair to make the polyjuice potion
	the other ingredients were easy
	i stole boomslang skin from the dungeons
	when the potions master found me in his office, i said i was under orders to search it
	and what became of wormtail after you attacked moody  said dumbledore
	wormtail returned to care for my master, in my father's house, and to keep watch over my father
	but your father escaped, said dumbledore
	after a while he began to fight the imperius curse just as i had done
	there were periods when he knew what was happening
	my master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the house
	he forced him to send letters to the ministry instead
	he made him write and say he was ill
	but wormtail neglected his duty
	he was not watchful enough
	my master guessed that he was heading for hogwarts
	my father was going to tell dumbledore everything, to confess
	he was going to admit that he had smuggled me from azkaban
	my master sent me word of my father's escape
	he told me to stop him at all costs
	so i waited and watched
	i used the map i had taken from harry potter
	the map that had almost ruined everything
	map  said dumbledore quickly
	what map is thispotter's map of hogwarts
	potter saw me on it
	potter saw me stealing more ingredients for the polyjuice potion from snape's office one night
	he thought i was my father
	we have the same first name
	i took the map from potter that night
	i told him my father hated dark wizards
	potter believed my father was after snape
	for a week i waited for my father to arrive at hogwarts
	at last, one evening, the map showed my father entering the grounds
	i pulled on my invisibility cloak and went down to meet him
	he was walking around the edge of the forest
	then potter came, and krum
	i could not hurt potter my master needed him
	potter ran to get dumbledore
	master barty, master barty, what is you sayingyou killed your father, dumbledore said, in the same soft voice
	what did you do with the bodycarried it into the forest
	covered it with the invisibility cloak
	i had the map with me
	i watched potter run into the castle
	dumbledore joined them
	i watched potter bringing dumbledore out of the castle
	i walked back out of the forest, doubled around behind them, went to meet them
	i told dumbledore snape had told me where to come
	dumbledore told me to go and look for my father
	i went back to my father's body
	when everyone was gone, i transfigured my father's body
	i buried it, while wearing the invisibility cloak, in the freshly dug earth in front of hagrid's cabin
	there was complete silence now, except for winky's continued sobs
	then dumbledore said, and tonight
	i offered to carry the triwizard cup into the maze before dinner, whispered barty crouch
	turned it into a portkey
	my master's plan worked
	he is returned to power and i will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards
	the insane smile lit his features once more, and his head drooped onto his shoulder as winky wailed and sobbed at his side
	chapter thirtysix  the parting of the waysdumbledore stood up
	he stared down at barty crouch for a moment with disgust on his face
	then he raised his wand once more and ropes flew out of it, ropes that twisted themselves around barty crouch, binding him tightly
	he turned to professor mcgonagall
	minerva, could i ask you to stand guard here while i take harry upstairsof course, said professor mcgonagall
	she looked slightly nauseous, as though she had just watched someone being sick
	however, when she drew out her wand and pointed it at barty crouch, her hand was quite steady
	severus  dumbledore turned to snape  please tell madam pomfrey to come down here we need to get alastor moody into the hospital wing
	then go down into the grounds, find cornelius fudge, and bring him up to this office
	he will undoubtedly want to question crouch himself
	tell him i will be in the hospital wing in half an hour's time if he needs me
	snape nodded silently and swept out of the room
	harry  dumbledore said gently
	harry got up and swayed again the pain in his leg, which he had not noticed all the time he had been listening to crouch, now returned in full measure
	he also realized that he was shaking
	dumbledore gripped his arm and helped him out into the dark corridor
	i want you to come up to my office first
	harry, he said quiedy as they headed up the passageway
	sirius is waiting for us there
	a kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were upon him, but he did not care he was even glad of it
	he didn't want to have to think about anything that had happened since he had first touched the triwizard cup
	he didn't want to have to examine the memories, fresh and sharp as photographs, which kept flashing across his mind
	madeye moody, inside the trunk
	wormtail, slumped on the ground, cradling his stump of an arm
	voldemort, rising from the steaming cauldron
	cedric, asking to be returned to his parents
	professor, harry mumbled, where are mr
	diggorythey are with professor sprout, said dumbledore
	his voice, which had been so calm throughout the interrogation of barty crouch, shook very slightly for the first time
	she was head of cedric's house, and knew him best
	they had reached the stone gargoyle
	dumbledore gave the password, it sprang aside, and he and harry went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door
	dumbledore pushed it open
	sirius was standing there
	his face was white and gaunt as it had been when he had escaped azkaban
	in one swift moment, he had crossed the room
	harry, are you all right  i knew it  i knew something like this  what happenedhis hands shook as he helped harry into a chair in front of the desk
	what happened  he asked more urgently
	dumbledore began to tell sirius everything barty crouch had said
	harry was only half listening
	so tired every bone in his body was aching, he wanted nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours and hours, until he fell asleep and didn't have to think or feel anymore
	there was a soft rush of wings
	fawkes the phoenix had left his perch, flown across the office, and landed on harry's knee
	'lo, fawkes, said harry quietly
	he stroked the phoenix's beautiful scarletandgold plumage
	fawkes blinked peacefully up at him
	there was something comforting about his warm weight
	dumbledore stopped talking
	he sat down opposite harry, behind his desk
	he was looking at harry, who avoided his eyes
	dumbledore was going to question him
	he was going to make harry relive everything
	i need to know what happened after you touched the portkey in the maze
	harry, said dumbledore
	we can leave that till morning, can't we, dumbledore  said sirius harshly
	he had put a hand on harrys shoulder
	let him have a sleep
	harry felt a rush of gratitude toward sirius, but dumbledore took no notice of sirius's words
	he leaned forward toward harry
	very unwillingly, harry raised his head and looked into those blue eyes
	if i thought i could help you, dumbledore said gently, by putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight, i would do it
	numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it
	you have shown bravery beyond anything i could have expected of you
	i ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time
	i ask you to tell us what happened
	the phoenix let out one soft, quavering note
	it shivered in the air, and harry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach, warming him, and strengthening him
	he took a deep breath and began to tell them
	as he spoke, visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes he saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived voldemort he saw the death eaters apparating between the graves around them he saw cedric's body, lying on the ground beside the cup
	once or twice, sirius made a noise as though about to say something, his hand still tight on harry's shoulder, but dumbledore raised his hand to stop him, and harry was glad of this, because it was easier to keep going now he had started
	it was even a relief he felt almost as though something poisonous were being extracted from him
	it was costing him every bit of determination he had to keep talking, yet he sensed that once he had finished, he would feel better
	when harry told of wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger, however, sirius let out a vehement exclamation and dumbledore stood up so quickly that harry started
	dumbledore walked around the desk and told harry to stretch out his arm
	harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them
	he said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's, harry told dumbledore
	he said the protection my  my mother left in me  he'd have it too
	and he was right  he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face
	for a fleeting instant, harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in dumbledore's eyes
	harry was sure he had imagined it, for when dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk, he looked as old and weary as harry had ever seen him
	very well, he said, sitting down again
	voldemort has overcome that particular barrier
	harry, continue, please
	harry went on he explained how voldemort had emerged from the cauldron, and told them all he could remember of voldemort's speech to the death eaters
	then he told how voldemort had untied him, returned his wand to him, and prepared to duel
	but when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and voldemort's wands, he found his throat obstructed
	he tried to keep talking, but the memories of what had come out of voldemort's wand were flooding into his mind
	he could see cedric emerging, see the old man, bertha jorkins
	he was glad when sirius broke the silence
	the wands connected  he said, looking from harry to dumbledore
	whyharry looked up at dumbledore again, on whose face there was an arrested look
	priori incantatem, he muttered
	his eyes gazed into harry's and it was almost as though an invisible beam of understanding shot between them
	the reverse spell effect  said sirius sharply
	exactly, said dumbledore
	harry's wand and voldemorts wand share cores
	each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix
	this phoenix, in fact, he added, and he pointed at the scarletandgold bird, perching peacefully on harry's knee
	my wand's feather came from fawkes  harry said, amazed
	ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand, the moment you left his shop four years ago
	so what happens when a wand meets its brother  said sirius
	they will not work properly against each other, said dumbledore
	if, however, the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle
	a very rare effect will take place
	one of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed  in reverse
	the most recent first
	and then those which preceded it
	he looked interrogatively at harry, and harry nodded
	which means, said dumbledore slowly, his eyes upon harry's face, that some form of cedric must have reappeared
	diggory came back to life  said sirius sharply
	no spell can reawaken the dead, said dumbledore heavily
	all that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo
	a shadow of the living cedric would have emerged from the wand
	am i correct, harryhe spoke to me, harry said
	he was suddenly shaking again
	the ghost cedric, or whatever he was, spoke
	an echo, said dumbledore, which retained cedric's appearance and character
	i am guessing other such forms appeared
	less recent victims of voldemort's wand
	an old man, harry said, his throat still constricted
	your parents  said dumbledore quietly
	sirius's grip on harry's shoulder was now so tight it was painful
	the last murders the wand performed, said dumbledore, nodding
	more would have appeared, of course, had you maintained the connection
	very well, harry, these echoes, these shadows
	what did they doharry described how the figures that had emerged from the wand had prowled the edges of the golden web, how voldemort had seemed to fear them, how the shadow of harry's mother had told him what to do, how cedric's had made its final request
	harry found he could not continue
	he looked around at sirius and saw that he had his face in his hands
	harry suddenly became aware that fawkes had left his knee
	the phoenix had fluttered to the floor
	it was resting its beautiful head against  harry's injured leg, and thick, pearly tears were falling from its eyes onto the wound left by the spider
	his leg was repaired
	i will say it again, said dumbledore as the phoenix rose into the air and resettled itself upon the perch beside the door
	you have shown bravery beyond anything i could have expected of you tonight
	you have shown bravery equal to those who died fighting voldemort at the height of his powers
	you have shouldered a grown wizard's burden and found yourself equal to it  and you have now given us all we have a right to expect
	you will come with me to the hospital wing
	i do not want you returning to the dormitory tonight
	a sleeping potion, and some peace
	sirius, would you like to stay with himsirius nodded and stood up
	he transformed back into the great black dog and walked with harry and dumbledore out of the office, accompanying them down a flight of stairs to the hospital wing
	when dumbledore pushed open the door
	weasley, bill, ron, and hermione grouped around a harassedlooking madam pomfrey
	they appeared to be demanding to know where harry was and what had happened to him
	all of them whipped around as harry, dumbledore, and the black dog entered, and mrs
	weasley let out a kind of muffled scream
	harry  oh harryshe started to hurry toward him, but dumbledore moved between them
	molly, he said, holding up a hand, please listen to me for a moment
	harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight
	he has just had to relive it for me
	what he needs now is sleep, and peace, and quiet
	if he would like you all to stay with him, he added, looking around at ron, hermione, and bill too, you may do so
	but i do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer, and certainly not this evening
	she rounded on ron, hermione, and bill as though they were being noisy, and hissed,  did you hear  he needs quietheadmaster, said madam pomfrey, staring at the great black dog that was sirius, may i ask what  this dog will be remaining with harry for a while, said dumbledore simply
	i assure you, he is extremely well trained
	harry  i will wait while you get into bed
	harry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to dumbledore for asking the others not to question him
	it wasn't as though he didn't want them there but the thought of explaining it all over again, the idea of reliving it one more time, was more than he could stand
	i will be back to see you as soon as i have met with fudge, harry, said dumbledore
	i would like you to remain here tomorrow until i have spoken to the school
	as madam pomfrey led harry to a nearby bed, he caught sight of the real moody lying motionless in a bed at the far end of the room
	his wooden leg and magical eye were lying on the bedside table
	is he okay  harry asked
	he'll be fine, said madam pomfrey, giving harry some pajamas and pulling screens around him
	he took off his robes, pulled on the pajamas, and got into bed
	ron, hermione, bill, mrs
	weasley, and the black dog came around the screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him
	ron and hermione were looking at him almost cautiously, as though scared of him
	i'm all right, he told them
	weasleys eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his bedcovers unnecessarily
	madam pomfrey, who had bustled off to her office, returned holding a small bottle of some purple potion and a goblet
	you'll need to drink all of this
	it's a potion for dreamless sleep
	harry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls
	he felt himself becoming drowsy at once
	everything around him became hazy the lamps around the hospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a friendly way through the screen around his bed his body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather matress
	before he could finish the potion, before he could say another word, his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep
	harry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he didn't open his eyes, wanting to drop off again
	the room was still dimly lit he was sure it was still nighttime and had a feeling that he couldn't have been asleep very long
	then he heard whispering around him
	they'll wake him if they don't shut upwhat are they shouting about  nothing else can have happened, can itharry opened his eyes blearily
	someone had removed his glasses
	he could see the fuzzy outlines of mrs
	weasley and bill close by
	weasley was on her feet
	that's fudge's voice, she whispered
	and that's minerva mcgonagall's, isn't it  but what are they arguing aboutnow harry could hear them too  people shouting and running toward the hospital wing
	regrettable, but all the same, minerva   cornelius fudge was saying loudly
	you should never have brought it inside the castle  yelled professor mcgonagall
	when dumbledore finds out harry heard the hospital doors burst open
	unnoticed by any of the people around his bed, all of whom were staring at the door as bill pulled back the screens, harry sat up and put his glasses back on
	fudge came striding up the ward
	professors mcgonagall and snape were at his heels
	where's dumbledore  fudge demanded of mrs
	he's not here, said mrs
	this is a hospital wing
	minister, don't you think you'd do better to but the door opened, and dumbledore came sweeping up the ward
	what has happened said dumbledore sharply, looking from fudge to professor mcgonagall
	why are you disturbing these people  minerva, i'm surprised at you  i asked you to stand guard over barty crouch there is no need to stand guard over him anymore, dumbledore  she shrieked
	the minister has seen to thatharry had never seen professor mcgonagall lose control like this
	there were angry blotches of color in her cheeks, and a hands were balled into fists she was trembling with fury
	fudge that we had caught the death eater responsible for tonight's events, said snape, in a low voice he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question
	he insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle
	he brought it up to the office where barty crouch i told him you would not agree, dumbledore  mcgonagall fumed
	i told him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle, but my dear woman  roared fudge, who likewise looked angrier than harry had ever seen him, as minister of magic, it is my decision whether i wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous but professor mcgonagall's voice drowned fudge's
	the moment that  that thing entered the room, she screamed, pointing at fudge, trembling all over, it swooped down on crouch and  and harry felt a chill in his stomach as professor mcgonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened
	he did not need her to finish her sentence
	he knew what the dementor must have done
	it had administered its fatal kiss to barty crouch
	it had sucked his soul out through his mouth
	he was worse than dead
	by all accounts, he is no loss blustered fudge
	it seems he has been responsible for several deaths'
	but he cannot now give testimony, cornelius, said dumbledore
	he was staring hard at fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time
	he cannot give evidence about why he killed those people
	why he killed them  well, that's no mystery, is it  blustered fudge
	he was a raving lunatic  from what minerva and severus have told me, he seems to have thought he was doing it all on youknowwho's instructionslord voldemort was giving him instructions, cornelius, dumbledore said
	those peoples deaths were mere byproducts of a plan to restore voldemort to full strength again
	voldemort has been restored to his body
	fudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his face
	dazed and blinking, he stared back at dumbledore as if he couldn't quite believe what he had just heard
	he began to sputter, still goggling at dumbledore
	returned  preposterous
	come now, dumbledore
	as minerva and severus have doubtless told you, said dumbledore, we heard barty crouch confess
	under the influence of veritaserum, he told us how he was smuggled out of azkaban, and how voldemort  learning of his continued existence from bertha jorkins  went to free him from his father and used him to capture harry
	the plan worked, i tell you
	crouch has helped voldemort to return
	see here, dumbledore, said fudge, and harry was astonished to see a slight smile dawning on his face, you  you can't seriously believe that youknowwho  back  come now, come now
	certainly, crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon youknowwho's orders  but to take the word of a lunatic like that, dumbledore
	when harry touched the triwizard cup tonight, he was transported straight to voldemort, said dumbledore steadily
	he witnessed lord voldemort's rebirth
	i will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office
	dumbledore glanced around at harry and saw that he was awake, but shook his head and said, i am afraid i cannot permit you to question harry tonight
	fudge's curious smile lingered
	he too glanced at harry, then looked back at dumbledore, and said, you are  er  prepared  to take harry's word on this, are you, dumbledore           there was a moment's silence, which was broken by sirius growling
	his hackles were raised, and he was baring his teeth at fudge
	certainly, i believe harry, said dumbledore
	his eyes were blazing now
	i heard crouch's confession, and i heard harry's account of what happened after he touched the triwizard cup the two stories make sense, they explain everything that has happened since bertha jorkins disappeared last summer
	fudge still had that strange smile on his face
	once again, he glanced at harry before answering
	you are prepared to believe that lord voldemort has returned, on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a boy who
	fudge shot harry another look, and harry suddenly understood
	you've been reading rita skeeter, mr
	fudge, he said quietly
	weasley, and bill all jumped
	none of them had realized that harry was awake
	fudge reddened slightly, but a defiant and obstinate look came over his face
	and if i have  he said, looking at dumbledore
	if i have discovered that you've been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet  a parselmouth, eh  and having funny turns all over the place i assume that you are referring to the pains harry has been experiencing in his scar said dumbledore coolly
	you admit that he has been having these pains, then  said fudge quickly
	headaches  nightmares  possibly  hallucinationslisten to me, cornelius, said dumbledore, taking a step toward fudge, and once again, he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that harry had felt after dumbledore had stunned young crouch
	harry is as sane as you or i
	that scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains
	i believe it hurts him when lord voldemort is close by, or feeling particularly murderous
	fudge had taken half a step back from dumbledore, but he looked no less stubborn
	you'll forgive me, dumbledore, but i've never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before
	look, i saw voldemort come back  harry shouted
	he tried to get out of bed again, but mrs
	weasley forced him back
	i saw the death eaters  i can give you their names lucius malfoy snape made a sudden movement, but as harry looked at him, snape's eyes flew back to fudge
	malfoy was cleared said fudge, visibly affronted
	a very old family  donations to excellent causes macnair  harry continued
	also cleared  now working for the ministryavery  nott  crabbe  goyle you are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being death eaters thirteen years ago  said fudge angrily
	you could have found those names in old reports of the trials  for heavens sake, dumbledore  the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too  his tales are getting taller, and you're still swallowing them  the boy can talk to snakes
	dumbledore, and you still think he's trustworthy                   you fool  professor mcgonagall cried
	crouch  these deaths were not the random work of a lunatic    i see no evidence to the contrary  shouted fudge, now matching her anger, his face purpling
	it seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen yearsharry couldn't believe what he was hearing
	he had always thought of fudge as a kindly figure, a little blustering, a little pompous, but essentially goodnatured
	but now a short, angry wizard stood before him, refusing, pointblank, to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world  to believe that voldemort could have risen
	voldemort has returned, dumbledore repeated
	if you accept that fact straightaway
	fudge, and take the necessary measures, we may still be able to save the situation
	the first and most essential step is to remove azkaban from the control of the dementors preposterous  shouted fudge again
	remove the dementors  i'd be kicked out of office for suggesting it  half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing guard at azkabanthe rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds, cornelius, knowing that you have put lord voldemort's most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them  said dumbledore
	they will not remain loyal to you, fudge  voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can with the dementors behind him, and his old supporters returned to him, you will be hardpressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years agofudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words could express his outrage
	the second step you must take  and at once, dumbledore pressed on, is to send envoys to the giants
	envoys to the giants  fudge shrieked, finding his tongue again
	what madness is thisextend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late, said dumbledore, or voldemort will persuade them, as he did before, that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedomyou  you cannot be serious  fudge gasped, shaking his head and retreating further from dumbledore
	if the magical community got wind that i had approached the giants  people hate them, dumbledore  end of my career you are blinded, said dumbledore, his voice rising now, the aura of power around him palpable, his eyes blazing once more, by the love of the office you hold, cornelius  you place too much importance, and you always have done, on the socalled purity of blood  you fail to recognize that it matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be  your dementor has just destroyed the last remaining member of a pureblood family as old as any  and see what that man chose to make of his life  i tell you now take the steps i have suggested, and you will be remembered, in office or out, as one of the bravest and greatest ministers of magic we have ever known
	fail to act  and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuildinsane, whispered fudge, still backing away
	and then there was silence
	madam pomfrey was standing frozen at the foot of harry's bed, her hands over her mouth
	weasley was still standing over harry, her hand on his shoulder to prevent him from rising
	bill, ron, and hermione were staring at fudge
	if your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this, cornelius, said dumbledore, we have reached a parting of the ways
	you must act as you see fit
	and i  i shall act as i see fit
	dumbledore's voice carried no hint of a threat it sounded like a mere statement, but fudge bristled as though dumbledore were advancing upon him with a wand
	now, see here, dumbledore, he said, waving a threatening finger
	i've given you free rein, always
	i've had a lot of respect for you
	i might not have agreed with some of your decisions, but i've kept quiet
	there aren't many who'd have let you hire werewolves, or keep hagrid, or decide what to teach your students without reference to the ministry
	but if you're going to work against me the only one against whom i intend to work, said dumbledore, is lord voldemort
	if you are against him, then we remain, cornelius, on the same side
	it seemed fudge could think of no answer to this
	he rocked backward and forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands
	finally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, he can't be back, dumbledore, he just can't be
	snape strode forward, past dumbledore, pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as he went
	he stuck out his forearm and showed it to fudge, who recoiled
	there, said snape harshly
	it is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago, when it burned black, but you can still see it
	every death eater had the sign burned into him by the dark lord
	it was a means of distinguishing one another, and his means of summoning us to him
	when he touched the mark of any death eater, we were to disapparate, and apparate, instantly, at his side
	this mark has been growing clearer all year
	why do you think karkaroff fled tonight  we both felt the mark burn
	we both knew he had returned
	karkaroff fears the dark lord's vengeance
	he betrayed too many of his fellow death eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold
	fudge stepped back from snape too
	he was shaking his head
	he did not seem to have taken in a word snape had said
	he stared, apparently repelled by the ugly mark on snape's arm, then looked up at dumbledore and whispered, i don't know what you and your staff are playing at, dumbledore, but i have heard enough
	i have no more to add
	i will be in touch with you tomorrow, dumbledore, to discuss the running of this school
	i must return to the ministry
	he had almost reached the door when he paused
	he turned around, strode back down the dormitory, and stopped at harry's bed
	your winnings, he said shortly, taking a large bag of gold out of his pocket and dropping it onto harrys bedside table
	one thousand galleons
	there should have been a presentation ceremony, but under the circumstances
	he crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked out of the room, slamming the door behind him
	the moment he had disappeared, dumbledore turned to look at the group around harry's bed
	there is work to be done, he said
	am i right in thinking that i can count on you and arthurof course you can, said mrs
	she was white to the lips, but she looked resolute
	we know what fudge is
	it's arthur's fondness for muggles that has held him back at the ministry all these years
	fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride
	then i need to send a message to arthur, said dumbledore
	all those that we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately, and he is well placed to contact those at the ministry who are not as shortsighted as cornelius
	i'll go to dad, said bill, standing up
	excellent, said dumbledore
	tell him what has happened
	tell him i will be in direct contact with him shortly
	he will need to be discreet, however
	if fudge thinks i am interfering at the ministry leave it to me, said bill
	he clapped a hand on harry's shoulder, kissed his mother on the cheek, pulled on his cloak, and strode quickly from the room
	minerva, said dumbledore, turning to professor mcgonagall, i want to see hagrid in my office as soon as possible
	also  if she will consent to come  madame maxime
	professor mcgonagall nodded and left without a word
	poppy, dumbledore said to madam pomfrey, would you be very kind and go down to professor moodys office, where i think you will find a houseelf called winky in considerable distress  do what you can for her, and take her back to the kitchens
	i think dobby will look after her for us
	very  very well, said madam pomfrey, looking startled, and she too left
	dumbledore made sure that the door was closed, and that madam pomfrey's footsteps had died away, before he spoke again
	and now, he said, it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are
	if you could resume your usual form
	the great black dog looked up at dumbledore, then, in an instant, turned back into a man
	weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed
	sirius black  she shrieked, pointing at him
	mum, shut up  ron yelled
	it's okaysnape had not yelled or jumped backward, but the look on his face was one of mingled fury and horror
	him  he snarled, staring at sirius, whose face showed equal dislike
	what is he doing herehe is here at my invitation, said dumbledore, looking between them, as are you, severus
	it is time for you to lay aside your old differences and trust each other
	harry thought dumbledore was asking for a near miracle
	sirius and snape were eyeing each other with the utmost loathing
	i will settle, in the short term, said dumbledore, with a bite of impatience in his voice, for a lack of open hostility
	you will shake hands
	you are on the same side now
	time is short, and unless the few of us who know the truth do not stand united, there is no hopefor any us
	very slowly  but still glaring at each other as though each wished the other nothing but ill  sirius and snape moved toward each other and shook hands
	they let go extremely quickly
	that will do to be going on with, said dumbledore, stepping between them once more
	now i have work for each of you
	fudge's attitude, though not unexpected, changes everything
	sirius, i need you to set off at once
	you are to alert remus lupin, arabella figg, mundungus fletcher  the old crowd
	lie low at lupin's for a while i will contact you there
	he wanted sirius to stay
	he did not want to have to say goodbye again so quickly
	you'll see me very soon
	harry, said sirius, turning to him
	but i must do what i can, you understand, don't youyeah, said harry
	sirius grasped his hand briefly, nodded to dumbledore, transformed again into the black dog, and ran the length of the room to the door, whose handle he turned with a paw
	severus, said dumbledore, turning to snape, you know what i must ask you to do
	if you are prepared
	he looked slightly paler than usual, and his cold, black eyes glittered strangely
	then good luck, said dumbledore, and he watched, with a trace of apprehension on his face, as snape swept wordlessly after sirius
	it was several minutes before dumbledore spoke again
	i must go downstairs, he said finally
	i must see the diggorys
	harry  take the rest of your potion
	i will see all of you later
	harry slumped back against his pillows as dumbledore disappeared
	hermione, ron, and mrs
	weasley were all looking at him
	none of them spoke for a very long time
	you've got to take the rest of your potion
	weasley said at last
	her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the bottle and the goblet
	you have a good long sleep
	try and think about something else for a while
	think about what you're going to buy with your winningsi don't want that gold, said harry in an expressionless voice
	i shouldn't have won it
	it should've been cedric's
	the thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come out of the maze was threatening to overpower him
	he could feel a burning, prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes
	he blinked and stared up at the ceiling
	i told him to take the cup with me, said harry
	now the burning feeling was in his throat too
	he wished ron would look away
	weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put her arms around harry
	he had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother
	the full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as mrs
	weasley held him to her
	his mother s face, his father's voice, the sight of cedric, dead on the ground all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him
	there was a loud slamming noise, and mrs
	weasley and harry broke apart
	hermione was standing by the window
	she was holding something tight in her hand
	your potion, harry, said mrs
	weasley quickly, wiping her eyes on the back of her hand
	harry drank it in one gulp
	the effect was instantaneous
	heavy, irresistible waves of dreamless sleep broke over him he fell back onto his pillows and thought no more
	chapter thirtyseven  the beginningwhen he looked back, even a month later, harry found he had only scattered memories of the next few days
	it was as though he had been through too much to take in any more
	the recollections he did have were very painful
	the worst, perhaps, was the meeting with the diggorys that took place the following morning
	they did not blame him for what had happened on the contrary, both thanked him for returning cedric's body to them
	diggory sobbed through most of the interview
	diggory's grief seemed to be beyond tears
	he suffered very little then, she said, when harry had told her how cedric had died
	and after all, amos
	he died just when he'd won the tournament
	he must have been happy
	when they got to their feet, she looked down at harry and said, you look after yourself, now
	harry seized the sack of gold on the bedside table
	you take this, he muttered to her
	it should've been cedric's, he got there first, you take it  but she backed away from him
	oh no, it's yours, dear, i couldn't
	harry returned to gryffindor tower the following evening
	from what hermione and ron told him, dumbledore had spoken to the school that morning at breakfast
	he had merely requested that they leave harry alone, that nobody ask him questions or badger him to tell the story of what had happened in the maze
	most people, he noticed, were skirting him in the corridors, avoiding his eyes
	some whispered behind their hands as he passed
	he guessed that many of them had believed rita skeeter's article about how disturbed and possibly dangerous he was
	perhaps they were formulating their own theories about how cedric had died
	he found he didn't care very much
	he liked it best when he was with ron and hermione and they were talking about other things, or else letting him sit in silence while they played chess
	he felt as though all three of them had reached an understanding they didn't need to put into words that each was waiting for some sign, some word, of what was going on outside hogwarts  and that it was useless to speculate about what might be coming until they knew anything for certain
	the only time they touched upon the subject was when ron told harry about a meeting mrs
	weasley had had with dumbledore before going home
	she went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer, he said
	but he wants you to go back to the dursleys, at least at first
	she said dumbledore's got his reasons, said ron, shaking his head darkly
	i suppose we've got to trust him, haven't wethe only person apart from ron and hermione that harry felt able to talk to was hagrid
	as there was no longer a defense against the dark arts teacher, they had those lessons free
	they used the one on thursday afternoon to go down and visit hagrid in his cabin
	it was a bright and sunny day fang bounded out of the open door as they approached, barking and wagging his tail madly
	who's that called hagrid, coming to the door
	harryhe strode out to meet them, pulled harry into a onearmed hug, ruffled his hair, and said, good ter see yeh, mate
	they saw two bucketsize cups and saucers on the wooden table in front of the fireplace when they entered hagrid's cabin
	bin havin' a cuppa with olympe, hagrid said
	who  said ron curiously
	madame maxime, o' course  said hagrid
	you two made up, have you  said ron
	dunno what yeh're talkin' about, said hagrid airily, fetching more cups from the dresser
	when he had made tea and offered around a plate of doughy cookies, he leaned back in his chair and surveyed harry closely through his beetleblack eyes
	you all righ'  he said grufflyyeah, said harry
	no, yeh're not, said hagrid
	knew he was goin' ter come back, said hagrid, and harry, ron, and hermione looked up at him, shocked
	knew he was out there, bidin' his time
	well, now it has, an' we'll jus' have ter get on with it
	migh' be able ter stop him before he gets a good hold
	that's dumbledores plan, anyway
	great man, dumbledore
	's long as we've got him, i'm not too worried
	hagrid raised his bushy eyebrows at the disbelieving expressions on their faces
	no good sittin' worryin' abou' it, he said
	what's comin' will come, an we'll meet it when it does
	dumbledore told me wha' you did
	hagrid's chest swelled as he looked at harry
	yeh did as much as yer father would've done, an' i can' give yeh no higher praise than that
	harry smiled back at him
	it was the first time he'd smiled in days
	what's dumbledore asked you to do, hagrid  he asked
	he sent professor mcgonagall to ask you and madame maxime to meet him  that night
	got a little job fer me over the summer, said hagrid
	i'm not s'pposed ter talk abou' it, no, not even ter you lot
	olympe  madame maxime ter you  might be comin' with me
	think i got her persuaded
	is it to do with voldemorthagrid flinched at the sound of the name
	migh' be, he said evasively
	who'd like ter come an' visit the las' skrewt with me  i was jokin'  jokin' he added hastily, seeing the looks on their faces
	it was with a heavy heart that harry packed his trunk up in the dormitory on the night before his return to privet drive
	he was dreading the leaving feast, which was usually a cause for celebration, when the winner of the interhouse championship would be announced
	he had avoided being in the great hall when it was full ever since he had left the hospital wing, preferring to eat when it was nearly empty to avoid the stares of his fellow students
	when he, ron, and hermione entered the hall, they saw at once that the usual decorations were missing
	the great hall was normally decorated with the winning house's colors for the leaving feast
	tonight, however, there were black drapes on the wall behind the teachers' table
	harry knew instantly that they were there as a mark of respect to cedric
	the real madeye moody was at the staff table now, his wooden leg and his magical eye back in place
	he was extremely twitchy, jumping every time someone spoke to him
	harry couldn't blame him moodys fear of attack was bound to have been increased by his tenmonth imprisonment in his own trunk
	professor karkaroff s chair was empty
	harry wondered, as he sat down with the other gryffindors, where karkaroff was now, and whether voldemort had caught up with him
	madame maxime was still there
	she was sitting next to hagrid
	they were talking quietly together
	further along the table, sitting next to professor mcgonagall, was snape
	his eyes lingered on harry for a moment as harry looked at him
	his expression was difficult to read
	he looked as sour and unpleasant as ever
	harry continued to watch him, long after snape had looked away
	what was it that snape had done on dumbledores orders, the night that voldemort had returned  and why
	was dumbledore so convinced that snape was truly on their side  he had been their spy, dumbledore had said so in the pensieve
	snape had turned spy against voldemort, at great personal risk
	was that the job he had taken up again  had he made contact with the death eaters, perhaps  pretended that he had never really gone over to dumbledore, that he had been, like voldemort himself, biding his timeharry's musings were ended by professor dumbledore, who stood up at the staff table
	the great hall, which in any case had been less noisy than it usually was at the leaving feast, became very quiet
	the end, said dumbledore, looking around at them all, of another year
	he paused, and his eyes fell upon the hufflepuff table
	theirs had been the most subdued table before he had gotten to his feet, and theirs were still the saddest and palest faces in the hall
	there is much that i would like to say to you all tonight, said dumbledore, but i must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person, who should be sitting here, he gestured toward the hufflepuffs, enjoying our feast with us
	i would like you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to cedric diggory
	they did it, all of them the benches scraped as everyone in the hall stood, and raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice, cedric diggory
	harry caught a glimpse of cho through the crowd
	there were tears pouring silently down her face
	he looked down at the table as they all sat down again
	cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish hufflepuff house, dumbledore continued
	he was a good and loyal friend, a hard worker, he valued fair play
	his death has affected you all, whether you knew him well or not
	i think that you have the right, therefore, to know exactly how it came about
	harry raised his head and stared at dumbledore
	cedric diggory was murdered by lord voldemort
	a panicked whisper swept the great hall
	people were staring at dumbledore in disbelief, in horror
	he looked perfectly calm as he watched them mutter themselves into silence
	the ministry of magic, dumbledore continued, does not wish me to tell you this
	it is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that i have done so  either because they will not believe that lord voldemort has returned, or because they think i should not tell you so, young as you are
	it is my belief, however, that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to pretend that cedric died as the result of an accident, or some sort of blunder of his own, is an insult to his memory
	stunned and frightened, every face in the hall was turned toward dumbledore now
	or almost every face
	over at the slytherin table
	harry saw draco malfoy muttering something to crabbe and goyle
	harry felt a hot, sick swoop of anger in his stomach
	he forced himself to look back at dumbledore
	there is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with cedrics death, dumbledore went on
	i am talking, of course, about harry potter
	a kind of ripple crossed the great hall as a few heads turned in harry's direction before flicking back to face dumbledore
	harry potter managed to escape lord voldemort, said dumbledore
	he risked his own life to return cedric's body to hogwarts
	he showed, in every respect, the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing lord voldemort, and for this, i honor him
	dumbledore turned gravely to harry and raised his goblet once more
	nearly everyone in the great hall followed suit
	they murmured his name, as they had murmured cedric's, and drank to him
	but through a gap in the standing figures
	harry saw that malfoy, crabbe, goyle, and many of the other slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets untouched
	dumbledore, who after all possessed no magical eye, did not see them
	when everyone had once again resumed their seats, dumbledore continued, the triwizard tournament's aim was to further and promote magical understanding
	in the light of what has happened  of lord voldemorts return  such ties are more important than ever before
	dumbledore looked from madame maxime and hagrid, to fleur delacour and her fellow beauxbatons students, to viktor krum and the durmstrangs at the slytherin table
	krum, harry saw, looked wary, almost frightened, as though he expected dumbledore to say something harsh
	every guest in this hall, said dumbledore, and his eyes lingered upon the durmstrang students, will be welcomed back here at any time, should they wish to come
	i say to you all, once again  in the light of lord voldemort's return, we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided
	lord voldemorts gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great
	we can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust
	differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open
	it is my belief and never have i so hoped that i am mistaken  that we are all facing dark and difficult times
	some of you in this hall have already suffered directly at the hands of lord voldemort
	many of your families have been torn asunder
	a week ago, a student was taken from our midst
	remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of lord voldemort
	remember cedric diggory
	harry's trunk was packed hedwig was back in her cage on top of it
	he, ron, and hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the fourth years for the carriages that would take them back to hogsmeade station
	it was another beautiful summer's day
	he supposed that privet drive would be hot and leafy, its flower beds a riot of color, when he arrived there that evening
	the thought gave him no pleasure at all
	'arryhe looked around
	fleur delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle
	beyond her, far across the grounds
	harry could see hagrid helping madame maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness
	the beauxbatons carriage was about to take off
	we will see each uzzer again, i 'ope, said fleur as she reached him, holding out her hand
	i am 'oping to get a job 'ere, to improve my eenglish
	it's very good already, said ron in a strangled sort of voice
	fleur smiled at him hermione scowled
	goodbye, 'arry, said fleur, turning to go
	it 'az been a pleasure meeting youharrys spirits couldn't help but lift slightly as he watched fleur hurry back across the lawns to madame maxime, her silvery hair rippling in the sunlight
	wonder how the durmstrang students are getting back, said ron
	d' you reckon they can steer that ship without karkaroffkarkaroff did not steer, said a gruff voice
	he stayed in his cabin and let us do the vork
	krum had come to say goodbye to hermione
	could i have a vord  he asked her
	all right, said hermione, looking slightly flustered, and following krum through the crowd and out of sight
	you'd better hurry up  ron called loudly after her
	the carriages'll be here in a minutehe let harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what krum and hermione might be up to
	they returned quite soon
	ron stared at hermione, but her face was quite impassive
	i liked diggory, said krum abruptly to harry
	he vos alvays polite to me
	even though i vos from durmstrang  with karkaroff, he added, scowling
	have you got a new headmaster yet  said harrykrum shrugged
	he held out his hand as fleur had done, shook harry's hand, and then ron's
	ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of painful internal struggle
	krum had already started walking away when ron burst out, can i have your autographhermione turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages that were now trundling toward them up the drive, as krum, looking surprised but gratified, signed a fragment of parchment for ron
	the weather could not have been more different on the journey back to king's cross than it had been on their way to hogwarts the previous september
	there wasn't a single cloud in the sky
	harry, ron, and hermione had managed to get a compartment to themselves
	pigwidgeon was once again hidden under rons dress robes to stop him from hooting continually hedwig was dozing, her head under her wing, and crookshanks was curled up in a spare seat like a large, furry ginger cushion
	harry, ron, and hermione talked more fully and freely than they had all week as the train sped them southward
	harry felt as though dumbledore's speech at the leaving feast had unblocked him, somehow
	it was less painful to discuss what had happened now
	they broke off their conversation about what action dumbledore might be taking, even now, to stop voldemort only when the lunch trolley arrived
	when hermione returned from the trolley and put her money back into her schoolbag, she dislodged a copy of the daily prophet that she had been carrying in there
	harry looked at it, unsure whether he really wanted to know what it might say, but hermione, seeing him looking at it, said calmly, there's nothing in there
	you can look for yourself, but there's nothing at all
	i've been checking every day
	just a small piece the day after the third task saying you won the tournament
	they didn't even mention cedric
	nothing about any of it
	fudge is forcing them to keep quiet
	he'll never keep rita quiet, said harry
	not on a story like this
	oh, rita hasn't written anything at all since the third task, said hermione in an oddly constrained voice
	as a matter of fact, she added, her voice now trembling slightly, rita skeeter isn't going to be writing anything at all for a while
	not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her
	what are you talking about said ron
	i found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she wasn't supposed to be coming onto the grounds, said hermione in a rush
	harry had the impression that hermione had been dying to tell them this for days, but that she had restrained herself in light of everything else that had happened
	how was she doing it  said harry at once
	how did you find out  said ron, staring at her
	well, it was you, really, who gave me the idea
	did i  said harry, perplexed
	howbugging, said hermione happily
	but you said they didn't work oh not electronic bugs, said hermione
	rita skeeter  hermiones voice trembled with quiet triumph  is an unregistered animagus
	she can turn hermione pulled a small sealed glass jar out other bag
	you're kidding, said ron
	oh yes she is, said hermione happily, brandishing the jar at them
	inside were a few twigs and leaves and one large, fat beetle
	that's never  you're kidding  ron whispered, lifting the jar to his eyes
	no, i'm not, said hermione, beaming
	i caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing
	look very closely, and you'll notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears
	harry looked and saw that she was quite right
	he also remembered something
	there was a beetle on the statue the night we heard hagrid telling madame maxime about his mumexactly, said hermione
	and viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after we'd had our conversation by the lake
	and unless i'm very much mistaken, rita was perched on the windowsill of the divination class the day your scar hurt
	she's been buzzing around for stories all year
	when we saw malfoy under that tree
	he was talking to her, in his hand, said hermione
	that's how she's been getting all those nice little interviews with the slytherins
	they wouldn't care that she was doing something illegal, as long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us and hagrid
	hermione took the glass jar back from ron and smiled at the beetle, which buzzed angrily against the glass
	i've told her i'll let her out when we get back to london, said hermione
	i've put an unbreakable charm on the jar, you see, so she can't transform
	and i've told her she's to keep her quill to herself for a whole year
	see if she can't break the habit of writing horrible lies about people
	smiling serenely, hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbag
	the door of the compartment slid open
	granger, said draco malfoy
	crabbe and goyle were standing behind him
	all three of them looked more pleased with themselves, more arrogant and more menacing, than harry had ever seen them
	so, said malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the compartment and looking slowly around at them, a smirk quivering on his lips
	you caught some pathetic reporter, and potter's dumbledore's favorite boy again
	crabbe and goyle leered
	trying not to think about it, are we  said malfoy softly, looking around at all three of them
	trying to pretend it hasn't happenedget out, said harry
	he had not been this close to malfoy since he had watched him muttering to crabbe and goyle during dumbledores speech about cedric
	he could feel a kind of ringing in his ears
	his hand gripped his wand under his robes
	you've picked the losing side, potter  i warned you  i told you you ought to choose your company more carefully, remember  when we met on the train, first day at hogwarts  i told you not to hang around with riffraff like this  he jerked his head at ron and hermione
	potter  they'll be the first to go, now the dark lord's back  mudbloods and mugglelovers first  well  second  diggory was the fit was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the compartment
	blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every direction, deafened by a series of bangs, harry blinked and looked down at the floor
	malfoy, crabbe, and goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway
	he, ron, and hermione were on their feet, all three of them having used a different hex
	nor were they the only ones to have done so
	thought we'd see what those three were up to, said fred matteroffactly, stepping onto goyle and into the compartment
	he had his wand out, and so did george, who was careful to tread on malfoy as he followed fred inside
	interesting effect, said george, looking down at crabbe
	who used the furnunculus curseme, said harry
	odd, said george lightly
	looks as though those two shouldn't be mixed
	he seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face
	well, let's not leave them here, they don't add much to the decor
	ron, harry, and george kicked, rolled, and pushed the unconscious malfoy, crabbe, and goyle  each of whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of jinxes with which they had been hit  out into the corridor, then came back into the compartment and rolled the door shut
	exploding snap, anyone  said fred, pulling out a pack of cards
	they were halfway through their fifth game when harry decided to ask them
	you going to tell us, then  he said to george
	who you were blackmailingoh, said george darkly
	it doesn't matter, said fred, shaking his head impatiently
	it wasn't anything important
	we've given up, said george, shrugging
	but harry, ron, and hermione kept on asking, and finally, fred said, all right, all right, if you really want to know
	bagman said harry sharply
	are you saying he was involved in nah, said george gloomily
	he wouldn't have the brains
	well, what, then  said ron
	fred hesitated, then said, you remember that bet we had with him at the quidditch world cup  about how ireland would win, but krum would get the snitchyeah, said harry and ron slowly
	well, the git paid us in leprechaun gold he'd caught from the irish mascots
	soso, said fred impatiently, it vanished, didn't it  by next morning, it had gonebut  it must've been an accident, mustn't it  said hermione
	george laughed very bitterly
	yeah, that's what we thought, at first
	we thought if we just wrote to him, and told him he'd made a mistake, he'd cough up
	we kept trying to talk to him about it at hogwarts, but he was always making some excuse to get away from us
	in the end, he turned pretty nasty, said fred
	told us we were too young to gamble, and he wasn't giving us anything
	so we asked for our money back, said george glowering
	he didn't refuse  gasped hermione
	right in one, said fred
	but that was all your savings  said ron
	tell me about it, said george
	'course, we found out what was going on in the end
	lee jordan's dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off bagman as well
	turns out he's in big trouble with the goblins
	borrowed loads of gold off them
	a gang of them cornered him in the woods after the world cup and took all the gold he had, and it still wasn't enough to cover all his debts
	they followed him all the way to hogwarts to keep an eye on him
	he's lost everything gambling
	hasn't got two galleons to rub together
	and you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins backhow  said harry
	he put a bet on you, mate, said fred
	put a big bet on you to win the tournament
	bet against the goblins
	so that's why he kept trying to help me win  said harry
	well  i did win, didn't i so he can pay you your goldnope, said george, shaking his head
	the goblins play as dirty as him
	they say you drew with diggory, and bagman was betting you'd win outright
	so bagman had to run for it
	he did run for it right after the third task
	george sighed deeply and started dealing out the cards again
	the rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough harry wished it could have gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never arrive at king's cross
	but as he had learned the hard way that year, time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead, and all too soon, the hogwarts express was pulling in at platform nine and threequarters
	the usual confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark
	ron and hermione struggled out past malfoy, crabbe, and goyle, carrying their trunks
	harry, however, stayed put
	fred  george  wait a moment
	harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his triwizard winnings
	take it, he said, and he thrust the sack into george's hands
	what  said fred, looking flabbergasted
	take it, harry repeated firmly
	you're mental, said george, trying to push it back at harry
	no, i'm not, said harry
	you take it, and get inventing
	it's for the joke shop
	he is mental, fred said in an almost awed voice
	listen, said harry firmly
	if you don't take it, i'm throwing it down the drain
	i don't want it and i don't need it
	but i could do with a few laughs
	we could all do with a few laughs
	i've got a feeling we're going to need them more than usual before long
	harry, said george weakly, weighing the money bag in his hands, there's got to be a thousand galleons in here
	yeah, said harry, grinning
	think how many canary creams that is
	the twins stared at him
	just don't tell your mum where you got it
	although she might not be so keen for you to join the ministry anymore, come to think of it
	harry, fred began, but harry pulled out his wand
	look, he said flatly, take it, or i'll hex you
	i know some good ones now
	just do me one favor, okay  buy ron some different dress robes and say they're from you
	he left the compartment before they could say another word, stepping over malfoy, crabbe, and goyle, who were still lying on the floor, covered in hex marks
	uncle vernon was waiting beyond the barrier
	weasley was close by him
	she hugged harry very tightly when she saw him and whispered in his ear, i think dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer
	keep in touch, harry
	harry, said ron, clapping him on the back
	'bye, harry  said hermione, and she did something she had never done before, and kissed him on the cheek
	harry  thanks, george muttered, while fred nodded fervently at his side
	harry winked at them, turned to uncle vernon, and followed him silently from the station
	there was no point worrying yet, he told himself, as he got into the back of the dursleys' car
	as hagrid had said, what would come, would come
	and he would have to meet it when it did
